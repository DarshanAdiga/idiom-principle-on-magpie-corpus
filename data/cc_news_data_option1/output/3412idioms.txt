At 2 p.m. Thursday, the Bryant Police Department received a call of a Bryant School District bus that had driven off the road just past the Mills Park and Shobe Road intersection, traveling at a low rate of speed.


  According to a Facebook post by the department, 11 children were on the bus at the time of the accident.


  No other vehicles were involved, a Bryant Public Schools statement said.


  Bryant Public Schools was notified that the bus driver, identified by the police department as Kimberly Rogers, was detained at the scene. The department post said she was "noticeably impaired" while speaking to the responding officer. She was taken to the department. After a series of tests, it was determined she was under the influence of prescription drugs.


  Rogers was charged with driving while intoxicated, careless and prohibited driving and 11 counts of endangering the welfare of minors.


  None of the students on the bus were injured or harmed in any way. All of the students were transferred to an alternate bus and arrived home safely, the district said.


  “Bryant Public Schools takes this matter very seriously,” the district said in a statement. “We are committed to the health and safety of our students at school and while traveling to and from school on the bus. This incident does not represent the district’s many bus driving professionals who safely deliver students to school and home every day.”


  Bryant Public Schools has said it will fully cooperate with law enforcement authorities in this matter.


  The district added it plans to address the issue with the bus driver as a personnel matter and therefore will not be able to comment further at this time.


  As of press time, Rogers remains in custody at the Saline County Detention Center.

THE FACTS: No, the video wasn't taken during that storm — or even in that part of the world. On Aug. 26, a Twitter user posted a video showing massive waves crashing against an oil rig and falsely claimed it was from Hurricane Laura. “Oil rigs evacuated ahead of soon to be Category 5 #HurricaneLaura. Potential environmental nightmare looming. Hope for the best,” the user tweeted. The false post had over 1,700 retweets on Twitter. In fact, the video shows waves hitting a swaying Borgholm Dolphin installation in the North Sea, about 145 miles east of Aberdeen, Scotland. Also, the video the Twitter user posted was stretched and mirrored, which exaggerated the impact of the waves. The BBC posted video of the incident to YouTube on January 12, 2015. One of the strongest hurricanes ever to strike the U.S., Laura roared ashore Thursday in Louisiana near the Texas border and pounded the Gulf Coast with wind and rain. The hurricane’s top wind speed of 150 mph (241 kph) put it among the most powerful systems on record in the U.S. Not until 11 hours after landfall did Laura finally weaken into a tropical storm as it churned toward Arkansas.

However, this constitutional mechanism gave rise to a thorny issue that prevails to date; i.e., the issue of devolution of land, police and financial powers to the provinces. The amended basic law of the land has not been fully implemented despite its enactment. During the last decade, It also became evident that even while holding onto the limited devolutionary powers, the Northern Provincial Council did not utilise the funds it was allocated to, for the benefit of the residents of the province. Some nationalistic MPs in the south demand repealing the 13th Amendment in the hope of totally abolishing provincial councils. As far as I know, their assumption and allegation that provincial councils are white elephants, are yet to be ascertained as fact by research carried out by means of a proper cost-benefit analysis of their performance. On the other hand, what new mechanism would be adopted instead of provincial councils, for addressing the issues of the minority communities? Would that new mechanism be tantamount to asymmetric devolution?

By and large, Trump's campaign has focused less on his own positive agenda and much more on the disastrous future he says would ensue if Democratic rival Joe Biden is elected. "Our entire economy, and our very way of life, are threatened by Biden's plans to transform our nation and subjugate our communities through the blunt-force instrument of federal regulation at a level that you haven't even seen yet," Trump said at an event in July at the White House. His campaign and the Republican National Committee have repeatedly attacked Biden's tax proposals, which have been released in stages. "[Biden's] plan to raise taxes by $4 trillion would stifle the American economy, and it would devastate the recovery that we are beginning to see under the president's leadership, even in the midst of this pandemic," Vice President Mike Pence said on a campaign call with reporters last month. (Biden's campaign disputes this message, maintaining that ads put out by the Trump campaign falsely claim that the former vice president's proposals will heavily raise taxes on middle-class families. Instead, Biden's campaign says his tax plans will target the wealthy and corporations. Biden has said he won't raise taxes on people making under $400,000.)

The updated list, released Friday by the Pentagon, also included China Three Gorges Corporation Limited, Sinochem Group Co Ltd and China Spacesat .


  The Pentagon's designations do not trigger penalties, but a 1999 law that mandates compilation of the list says the president may impose sanctions that could include blocking all property of the listed parties.


  The Pentagon has come under pressure from lawmakers of both U.S. political parties to publish the list, amid rising tensions between Washington and Beijing over technology, trade and foreign policy.


  The list will likely add to tensions between the world's two largest economies, which have been at loggerheads over the handling of the coronavirus pandemic and China's move to impose security legislation on Hong Kong, among multiple points of friction that have worsened this year.

On the other hand, the company continued to put up a great show in its e-commerce channel, with 95% growth in online sales during the fiscal second quarter. This majorly contributed to strong comparable store sales (comps) growth during the quarter. Notably, its e-commerce business added more than 3.5 million new customers in the fiscal second quarter. This represented more than 165% growth in new online customer acquisition year over year.      Driven by the robust e-commerce show and comps growth at stores that reopened, the company delivered positive comps of 13% in the quarter. Brand-wise, comps improved 24%, 12% and 19% at Old Navy Global, Gap Global and Athleta, respectively. However, comps for the Banana Republic Global were down 27%. The Banana Republic brand’s product mix was unfavorable due to the sudden shift of consumers’ demand to more casual fashion to meet stay-at-home requirements, which served as a disadvantage to the brand’s work wear assortments. However, the company is focused on adjusting to consumer preferences and improving inventory mix.      Brand-wise, net sales were down 5%, 28% and 52% at Old Navy Global, Gap Global and Banana Republic Global brands, respectively. Meanwhile, sales improved 6% for the Athleta brand. The company witnessed significant declines in in-store sales for all formats, with Old Navy down 36%, Gap down 55%, Banana Republic down 71% and Athleta down 45%. Meanwhile, there was a significant acceleration in the digital business for all brands, recording increases of 136%, 75%, 26% and 74%, respectively, for Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic and Athleta brands.      For the Gap brand, the company benefited from the brand’s fleet rationalization efforts, focused on maximizing online demand through relevant marketing, improved execution and customer engagement. Moreover, the Old Navy brand gained from the significant acceleration of online business due to robust customer demand as well as relevant digital marketing investments. The Athleta brand’s values-driven active and lifestyle categories as well as strong omni-channel presence boosted growth.

CARVER - For football coaches, players and parents, the month of September is always one to circle on the calendar. Aside from class ringing back in session, September always symbolizes a return to the field. This fall, however, local football programs are facing their stiffest rival yet, COVID-19, and it won't let any team into the endzone this fall.
 In a meeting last week, the MIAA Board of Directors voted to adopt a variety of safety policies, including the decision to slide the start of football, cheer, and unified basketball to a "floating season" in between the end of the winter season and the start of the spring.
 "Number one is the safety of the kids and everybody's health. (It) is the number one priority," Carver Head Coach Doug Borsari said, "I think the committees in place that handled these changes did a good job. I know some coaches want to play and others want to air on the side of safety, so I'm one of those guys that always airs on the side of safety when it comes to the kids. It'll be new. It'll be a first time for this. But, I think they did the best they could and they made the right decision."
 When COVID-19 came into full form in mid-March, it was an adjustment point for everyone. From wearing masks, to staying at home, to focusing on social distance, life added another layer of caution. Borsari remembers what he thought about the virus six months ago and how his intel evolved since.
 "Initially, I thought (COVID-19) was going to be shorter, but my wife is in the medical field and I was getting different information from her," Borsari said. "After a couple of weeks, I realized this will probably be a year to a year and a half, for lack of a better word, thing. I knew it wasn't going to be as short as I initially thought. I didn't think about the season at all (back then), I just thought about everyone's overall health, really. I wasn't thinking about football at all."
 When sifting through the safety protocols for the upcoming athletic year, sports were categorized into three tiers, gauged by the risk associated with them. Football has always been the one to keep an eye on because "socially distanced football" sounds like an oxymoron. That being said, Borsari and his coaching staff will adhere to each and every protocol in place and put an emphasis on keeping everyone safe on and off the field.
 "By nature, as a football guy, I'm a rule follower. I'm going to follow the guidelines that I'm given," Borsari said. "It'll be different for sure, but it's a hand-to-hand contact game. To socially distance, but to also compete in football will be interesting. I don't know what the guidelines will be when the season comes, so I'll follow the rules. I always do, but it'll be interesting. For sure."
 As training was set to be underway, Borsari is still hoping to get everyone into football shape. As of right now, the MIAA guidelines state that the fall season - which starts on Sept. 18 - can be used by football and cheer for practice purposes, only if they follow the EEA Cohort modifications. The modifications structure practices in a ten participant group fashion, where cohorts must workout together in all practices and be separated by 14 feet at all times. The size of a group depends on the size of the facility in use and there will be no event where more than 25 participants are on a playing surface. All of this hinges on the virus' containment and the hope that it doesn't become more severe in the coming weeks, in which an adjustment will likely be made.
 "The hope is to get everyone together," Borsari added, "I know the athletic directors in the South Shore League will be getting together in the next week or two to decide on what's appropriate for us to do, so I'll follow their lead. I'll always support our A.D. Phyllis (Bowie) and the league's A.D.'s and their decision so I'll hold tight until I hear from them," he said.
 Because of football's move to the early spring, that means no annual Thanksgiving Day game between the Crusaders and Middleborough Sachems. For those close to the program every year, the Thanksgiving rivalry game is a beloved tradition and not being on the sidelines will be a first for Borsari and his coaching staff.
 "Growing up in Plymouth and playing a Thanksgiving game, or being a part of one since I can remember because my dad was a coach and I was always on the sideline since the age of seven or eight," he said. "Not being a part of a Thanksgiving Day game for the first time will be really, really different."
 Football is a game of adjustment. Coaches have to adapt on the fly when approaching nearly every circumstance and although this may be football's toughest situation yet, moving the season to the early spring may be the sport's most impactful audible.

The acceptance speech of Vice President Mike Pence was conventional with Pence supporting four more years of President Trump who would restore law and order. Mike Pence addressed “riots and looting” in the streets, but didn’t mention Jacob Blake. On "CBS This Morning," Gayle King and Anthony Mason noted that the white vigilante from Kenosha toting his semi-automatic rifle walked by police with his hands raised and was initially ignored. What is the message, here?


  During the PBS discussions of the convention, Michael Nutter, former mayor of Philadelphia, had a chilling remark, that white and Black Americans wake up to very different realities each day. That is a heartbreaking statement on race relations in modern America.


  After an angry speech by Rudy Giuliani suggesting that the Democrats would release a flood of lawlessness and anarchy, President Trump finished the night boasting of his accomplishments and insisting Joe Biden would destroy "American Greatness." We need to define “American greatness.” During his acceptance speech, Trump also claimed he did more for African Americans than any other president since Abraham Lincoln. Did President Trump forget President Harry Truman integrating the military or President Lyndon Johnson signing the Civil Rights and Voting Rights acts?


  To be honest, I don’t agree with any of President Trump’s politics, and I am hardly unbiased, but I do agree with President Trump when he states this election is one of the most important in U.S. history. Both parties feel the apocalypse is coming if you vote for the other side.

Comedian Judy Gold said she had heard rumors about the "toxic" workplace environment at ___The Ellen DeGeneres Show_ for years. Last month, WarnerMedia launched an investigation into the show, but only after former staffers came forward with their allegations in _BuzzFeed News_ reports. Three senior executive producers were fired, and the show's upcoming fall season premiere was delayed a week.


  Gold, who won two Emmys for her work on _The Rosie O'Donnell Show_, told _Page Six_ DeGeneres was "very nice" when she worked with her once, but had heard rumors about _Ellen_ "forever." Gold continued, "Look here's the deal, yes there's a double standard... A woman like that is a bitch and a man like that is ambitious, great fine. But it's coming from multiple sources and when your public persona is be kind to everyone... And it's your show!"


  The worst rumor Gold heard about was a rule that DeGeneres' staffers were not allowed to look her in the eyes, which seems like a contraction from a host who reminds her audience to be kind. "That was one of the first things I had ever heard," Gold said. "I was like, 'Really?! Who says you can't look at me? Doesn't she say it at the end of the show? Be kind, be kind. You know, come on!'"


  The "no eye contact" policy was one of the rumors DeGeneres took head-on during a Zoom meeting with staffers this month. She reportedly denied the rumor, calling it "crazy" and "just not true." DeGeneres said she did not know how that rumor got started. "I don't know where it started. Please talk to me. Look me in the eye," DeGeneres said.


  It was also not the only rumor about DeGeneres being "cold" towards others. Earlier this month, Dana Dimatteo, an audience member who got on _The Ellen DeGeneres Show_ to compete in a game, said DeGeneres "snapped" into a different person when the cameras stopped. "During commercial breaks, Ellen would break out of her 'kind' character and sit moodily in silence on her couch, not acknowledging anyone," Dimatteo told _The Sun_. She said DeGeneres "snapped out of camera" when the show went to commercial.


  0comments


  While many celebrities have voiced support for DeGeneres, some said the rumors were well-known around Hollywood. Brad Garrett said it was "common knowledge," adding, "Sorry but it comes from the top [Ellen]. Know more than one who were treated horribly by her." Lea Thompson chimed in, "True story. It is," in response to Garrett's comments.


  Last week, executive producers Ed Glavin, Kevin Leman and Jonathan Norman were fired after former staffers accused them of sexual misconduct and harassment in a _BuzzFeed News_ report. DeGeneres sent a second apology to staffers after they were fired, telling them, "I'm not perfect. I'm multi- layered and I learn from my mistakes." _Ellen_ 's 18th season is now scheduled to debut on Sept. 14.

The city and the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality have cooperated on monitoring water quality in City Creek for several years, working with students from the Pocatello Community Charter School to help collect water samples. Testing done both last fall and this summer confirms the creek exceeds water quality standards for bacteria and isn't safe for swimming or wading.


  Hannah Sanger, Science and Environment Division manager for the city, said another round of water-quality testing was recently conducted. The city hopes to collect data to pinpoint where bacteria levels are increasing throughout the creek's course, thereby facilitating strategic control measures.


  "The City of Pocatello is really focused on trying to figure out what we can do to try to reduce E. coli at City Creek," Sanger said.


  Sanger said it helped a lot when the city put in portable toilets at the upper and lower City Creek parking areas. The city has also added waste stations to encourage dog owners to pick up after their pets, and Sanger said educational signage is in the works.


  City Creek is a tributary of the Portneuf River, which flows through the city in a concrete channel that can become choked by garbage. Annually, the city teams up with Idaho State University's Stream Ecology Center, Portneuf Watershed Partnership, and Portneuf Valley Partners to host a river cleanup, filling several Dumpsters with trash.


  This year's cleanup was scheduled for 10 a.m. Aug. 29, with volunteers working from Raymond Park to the J.R. Simplot Don Plant.


  Marjanna Hulet, who leads a 14-member girls' troop through Scouts BSA, has participated with her Scouts for several years. Her group takes the concrete channel section, where water flows about a half foot deep.


  In the past, her Scouts have brought a pair of canoes for loading trash as they wade the channel. Filling two Dumpsters at the end of their trek. This year, Hulet opened the cleanup to the broader community and arranged to bring five boats. They remove mostly heavy objects during their cleanups.


  "We pull out shopping carts and bicycles. We've pulled out obviously stolen things," Hulet said. "One year we found a safe and a backpack with a computer in it. There are a lot of bikes people have stolen and don't want to deal with."


  Just as the Portneuf River has seen abuse, Hulet has observed users are having a more significant impact on local recreation areas. Hulet noted it's a widespread problem affecting all of the country, including the national parks.


  It's not a problem that's going away, she added.


  "It really means we have to step up our game in taking care of (recreation areas) so they don't become ruined for everyone," Hulet said. "We want people to love it. We want people out there recreating, but that also means we need some education on it."

I believe Mr. Corrigan’s experience is attributed to the fact that he attended a fancy, private Catholic boys school and Blacks weren’t Catholic. But neither were Jews or Russians or Koreans or the Chinese. It's ridiculous to treat San Francisco’s cultural diversity as segregation.


  San Francisco was more like a combination pizza. If you ever visited San Francisco, you’d be familiar with Japantown, where you could eat and speak Japanese. It was near the Korean area just west of Russian Hill. North Beach was Italian, and there was a Catholic church on every corner. Mormons settled San Francisco before the Gold Rush and gave their hills to the Chinese settlers. Their children attended private Chinese schools and even today the street signs are in Chinese (and no one calls it segregation).


  Saying there was segregation is like diminishing a mushroom because it shares a spot on the pizza with a bell pepper. You may not like mushrooms, but that doesn’t make the mushroom less valuable. I digress.


  I worked at the telephone company from 1963-1966. I rode public transportation for three years with Catholics and Blacks and Chinese and gays from the Polk Street district, and I promise you, no one cared a hoot about your sexual preference, religion, race or language. It was a city where being ordinary was strange, and it had to be the least racist place on the planet.


  But I agree with Mr. Corrigan that by 1968 racism was on the move. So what happened?


  The reason for racist turmoil was the same then as it is now. Exactly the same. It was the violent rise of communist revolutionaries and the apathy and tolerance of normal folks who just wanted to live their lives.


  The Weather Underground was percolating, just across the Bay at the University of Berkeley. They were burning banks, attacking police, setting cars and buildings on fire and fomenting hate (sound familiar?). Patty Hearst was kidnapped at UC Berkeley, the Vietnam War was raging and my schoolmates were being drafted into a war they didn’t understand. Berkeley was simmering with Marxists that spawned the hate and disrespect shown to our brothers and sons returning from war. And thus began the terror and Anti-American hatred seen in cities all over America, both then and now.

HOWE -- The Bulldogs managed to move a step forward last season by picking up two district wins and climb the standings and finish just a game out of a playoff spot.


   


  And as head coach Bill Jehling enters his third season at the helm for Howe, he hopes to see that improvement continue.


   


  "We will be a very young football team. Several sophomores and juniors will be starting this year and contributing," Jehling said. "We will need to grow each week and get used to the speed of the game on Friday nights."


   


  The Bulldogs finished 3-7 overall for the second straight year but played better during the district portion of their schedule. Carrying over that production while trying to replace some key seniors.


   


  "The concept of team is brought into the program and the direction we are wanting to go," Jehling said. "Even though we are a young team, the kids are eager to improve, compete and win."


   


  The Bulldogs lost four second-team all-district picks on offense -- running back Brandon Williams, receivers Kolby Windon and Caden Harmon and tackle Jarron Ing -- and three first-team all-district defenders in lineman Steven Waldrip and linebackers J.C. Helpenstell and Hunter Brussow.


   


  Ing and Harmon, along with Layton Elvington, were second-team all-district defensive picks.


   


  Howe returns four starters on offense and four on defense. Three of these returning players should have a great impact on the Bulldogs success this season.


   


  First is senior running back Jalen Thornton (5-8, 160) who rushed for 906 yards and eight touchdowns on 142 carries and also caught 36 passes for 388 yards and three touchdowns to share the district's All-Purpose Player of the Year Award. His speed and diversity should help keep opponents at bay in any game situation.


   


  Quarterback Austin Haley (5-10, 165) had a solid freshman debut, completing 88 of155 passes for 1,476 yards and 16 touchdowns with only four interceptions, and shared the district's Newcomer of the Year Award.


   


  Senior Dakota Herrington (5-11, 240) is a strong player up front on both sides of the ball for Howe.


   


  Others expected to join Herrington on the line are senior Jackson Adkins (5-9, 220), junior Will Fleming (5-8, 275) and sophomore Matthew Berden (6-2, 210). Also slated for offensive line work are seniors Johnny Meneses and Seth Key.


   


  Running back Ethan Lopez (5-10, 175) will contribute in the backfield along with sophomore fullback Carson Daniels (5-10, 185).


   


  The receiving corps will be led by wide receiver Jordan Jones (5-11, 150), who totaled eight receptions for 200 yards and a pair of touchdowns, sophomore tight end/wide receiver Ryan Hough and sophomore Matt Hayes.


   


  Defensively, the Bulldogs expect several of the same players to contribute this season.


   


  Herrington, Adkins, who was named first-team all-district, and Fleming will all play roles on the defensive line.


   


  Daniels, sophomore Brice Crosby and freshman Cooper Jones hold down the linebacker positions for the Bulldogs.


   


  Thornton and Jones will both log time in the secondary at cornerback. The safeties for the Bulldogs will be sophomore Ryan Hough, Joey Hymel and senior Ethan Lopez.


   


  Senior kicker Kevin Flores was named second-team all-district last year.


   


  Much did not change for Howe when it came to the latest realignment -- the Bulldogs remain in a tough district.


   


  Pottsboro was the 3A Division I state runner-up and enters the season third in the statewide rankings. Emory Rains, Commerce and Bonham stayed with those two in District 5-3A (I), while Winnsboro, Mineola and Mount Vernon were added to the group. In addition to Pottsboro, Commerce, Rains, Mount Vernon and Winnsboro were all playoff teams a year ago.


   


  "Very tough district. We are the smallest school in the district as far as enrollment," Jehling said. "We missed going to 3A Division II by six kids. Our district features several of the top teams in the region and state."

VAN ALSTYNE -- It seems inevitable that Van Alstyne may experience some growing pains, especially early in the season.


   


  The Panthers return just one starter on offense and defense from last season's playoff team and are making a move up to Class 4A Division II, where they will be one of the smallest enrollments following the University Interscholastic League's latest realignment.


   


  They were also placed in a 4-4A (II) district that has some very tough competition, including the a perennial power in the Celina Bobcats.


   


  However, Van Alstyne head coach Mikel Miller is confident that his young team can get their feet under them and hit the ground running. One of the brightest points for optimism is the Panthers' overall team speed and athleticism.


   


  "We will be very young, so every day we have to improve," Miller said. "We have very few returning varsity kids and a small senior class, but we are confident in our younger kids getting better and our older kids leading them."


   


  Finding the right pieces to fit the established Van Alstyne system -- Miller is entering his twelfth year leading the program -- is also one of the biggest challenges.


   


  There will be new faces at every position after the Panthers finished 7-5 last season and 5-1 in district play, behind only 3A Division I state runner- up Pottsboro, and picked up their first playoff victory to reach the area round, where they lost to region runner-up Gladewater, after four straight bi- district losses.


   


  There are plenty of key losses to graduation from that group.


   


  On offense, it includes quarterback Tymothe Rosenthal, who completed 100-of-172 passes for 2,004 yards and 20 touchdowns with just six interceptions and was second-team all-district after transferring from Texoma Christian,


   


  Running back Jake Carroll was first-team all-district with 124 carries for 1,141 yards and 15 touchdowns; receiver Drelin Davis had 35 catches for 929 yards and eight TDs as a first-team all-district pick; and four offensive linemen were all-district selections -- Jake Loganbill on the first team and Jacob Taylor, Hunter Griffin and Cade Morgan on the second-team.


   


  Linebacker Zach Moncier shared the district's Defensive Player of the Year Award while Griffin, Davis and Cam Montgomery were all first-team all-district defenders. Montgomery was also second on the team in receiving with 35 catches for 686 yards and 10 touchdowns.


   


  Sophomore Dakota Howard (6-0, 160, 4.6) is expected to take snaps at quarterback.


   


  Another sophomore, Jayden Mahan, impressed as a freshman a year ago when he rushed for 454 yards and five touchdowns on 79 carries and is going to be counted on to lead the offense after sharing the district's Newcomer of the Year award.


   


  Veteran leadership will be expected in the trenches from seniors Jacob Gallardo (5-9, 260) and Jake Smallwood (5-11, 250). Other newcomers expected to contribute are sophomores Levi Copeland and Nick Loya.


   


  Senior Conner Loftice (6-0, 165) is expected to see work at the tight end position.


   


  A couple of the wide receiver positions should be filled by juniors Collin Reynolds (5-10, 165) and Gavin Montgomery (6-2, 160). Sophomore Mateen Boudoin is also expected to contribute to the receiving corps.


   


  On the defensive side of the ball, the Panthers will be in their normal 4-2-5 alignment.


   


  Gallardo will line up in his familiar position on the defensive line after being chosen second-team all-district, and will be joined by Smallwood. Colby Hayes is also expected to see time on the defensive front.


   


  Mahan (64 tackles) will return to the defensive side of the ball at his linebacker spot. Loftice is expected to also see time at linebacker.


   


  Reynolds, Montgomery and Boudoin are all being looked at to earn snaps in the secondary.


   


  On special teams, senior Aaron Beckham will once again handle the kicking duties. He made four field goals last season.


   


  While the Panthers have been used to being a perennial playoff team in Class 3A, the step up in classification might not hurt their chances that badly in their first foray into 4A. Van Alstyne was placed in a district with Celina, Aubrey, Sanger and Krum -- which means that only one team will not make the postseason out of the five-team district. Winning two games all but clinches a berth while it might take only one to advance.

A diversity report released Friday on Major League Baseball showed a modest increase in its overall diversity hiring practices, spurred by its improved gender diversity.


  The Institute for Diversity and Ethics and Sport at Central Florida gave MLB an overall score of 80.7, which was a letter grade of B. That’s up from a 79.5 in 2019. The grade for racial hiring dropped slightly from 89.4 to an 88.7 for a B-plus while gender hiring increased from 69.6 to 72.7 for a C.


  Richard Lapchick, the institute’s director and lead report author, called baseball’s gender hiring improvement a “highlight” of this year’s study. At the beginning of the 2020 season, there were 21 women who had on-field coaching or player development positions, which is up from seven in 2018.


  “It wasn’t that long ago that a thought about a woman on the field was not in anyone’s consciousness,” Lapchick said. “Having 21 women on the field is a dramatic jump. I think everyone saw that when the NBA started hiring and interviewing women there was a positive public reaction. MLB knew that would be good on the game.”

We all know sunflowers (helianthus), as they are one of the most recognizable flowers. Their brilliant color and rustic charm endear them to young and old, gardener and painter. They grace gardens and fields, blooming in the latter part of the summer. Those tall stalks not only beg our attention, but they also attract birds, butterflies and bees. I will always remember driving on a back road near Baltimore and coming across a breath-taking sight of sunflowers. The countryside was glowing with these bright, canary-yellow flowers that embellished the road for a long way. I have read and seen pictures of the fields in Italy, where you see sunflowers for miles, and I felt I was experiencing that sight.      Each August, I ask my son Will to let me know when his field of sunflowers is blooming. I like to go and just enjoy the site and to pick some for the house. I am always curious which way they will be facing when I visit his field. It is fun to watch the young flowers turn eastward at dawn to greet the sun. Then, as the sun starts to rise above the horizon, these charming flowers begin their romance with the sun as they follow it across the sky. By sunset time, they will be facing west to watch the sun disappear into the horizon. Then by morning, they are all facing east again and are ready to start again.      Sunflowers come in many different colors and sizes. There are the tall ones that come to mind when someone mentions sunflowers. There are also medium- sized ones that grow to about 4 or 5 feet. Today, you can even get dwarf varieties that are quite charming, only growing to about 2 feet tall. Their colors have a wide range of hues too, going from brilliant yellow to rust, brown and amber and shades in-between.      There are also sunflowers that are continuous bloomers. This spring, I was visiting nurseries as I usually do, mask on and keeping a distance of course; I was introduced to some new plants as I roamed the isles. I always want to see what the different garden centers bring in to sell and to see which plants are the most popular.      On my ventures to nurseries, two new annual sunflowers caught my attention. The first one was named SunBelievable or Brown Eyed Girl Helianthus. It has the happy face of a sunflower with multi-branching and dwarf in size. SunBelievable has golden yellow petals that become reddish-brown towards the base and they blend well into a dark brown center. This plant does not produce seed, putting all of its energy into making a constant crop of flowers. They are cheerful looking in the container and I was told that they bloomed all summer long. I was keen to give this plant a try.      When I purchased them, they had a few blooms and I assumed as the plant grew, I would see more. They have looked nice all summer, but now they are about to explode with even more blooms. I was content with the number I was getting, but in a week, I will have a bush with even more flowers covering the plant at a time when other flowers are starting to fade.      Shortly after finding SunBelievable, I was visiting another nursery and I spotted another dwarf sunflower that was bright, clear yellow. It was named Sunfinity. This plant was about 18 inches tall with yellow, daisy-looking flowers that were quite cheerful looking. This plant was developed to give the home gardener colorful, long-lasting sunflower looking blooms that are smaller and bloom over several months. Sunfinity was created to have many stems with a multitude of blooms to flower all season long. This was a unique and different way to look at sunflowers.   They do not have the large heads of what I think of as traditional sunflowers - the bloom is only about 3 inches wide. However, the number of blooms and the length of time they have flowers make up for the size.      There are companies that specialize in all the new and exciting sunflowers and catalogs to tempt you. You can save your seeds, but remember that cross- pollination could have occurred and you might not get a flower that is exactly like the one you collected seed from. It is best to purchase new fresh seeds each year if you want a particular looking sunflower. Sunflowers are a joy to grow, and I hope I always have some to greet the morning and to brighten the countryside.

McDonald's in the North Texas area is bringing Spicy Chicken McNuggets with Mighty Hot Sauce and a Chips Ahoy! McFlurry to the menu coming Sept. 16.


   


  According to owner and operator in the North Dallas area, Clift Johnson Jr., the nuggets have been a fan favorite so he is excited for the new addition.


   


  "McDonald's - We've had the same nuggets since 1983. We've had sauces come and go and have done some different things ... but we've never touched the actual nugget itself," Johnson said. "I mean as far as taste and profile are concerned, spicy is something in Texas that has always done extremely well, and it was really just something that was long overdue in my humble opinion, for us to give our customers a new taste. I'm just glad that it's finally here."


   


  The recipe will be a duplicate of the original nugget recipe, only spicy.


   


  "It's still the exact same recipe. It's still the same tempera. It's still the same crunch. It's just got a little more heat though," Johnson said.


   


  The McNuggets are available as a 4-, 6-, 10-, 20- or 40-piece options.


   


  "This is the first time we've introduced a new flavor of our classic Chicken McNuggets in the U.S. since they came to menus in 1983," said Vice President of Menu Innovation Linda VanGosen. "As our customers have been asking for Spicy McNuggets for some time now, we couldn't think of a better time to bring them to our menus. We can't wait for McNuggets fans to get a taste of these new spicy options."


   


  Johnson was able to taste the Spicy Chicken McNuggets last year and is sure that many will love the new product.


   


  "I'm very excited. I've tasted the product. Like I was saying before, it was one of those things where it's literally the exact same formula and the exact same recipe from our regular nuggets. It's literally just the spicier version of it," Johnson explained. "Full transparency, when they were telling me about it, my hopes were not high. But when I tried the product, I was pleasantly surprised. I immediately called my family and told them 'Oh my god. This is awesome. We've got something here.'"


   


  Johnson is also a fan of the new Chips Ahoy! McFlurry, which he says pairs very well with the Spicy Chicken McNuggets.


   


  "It too is awesome. It's literally our soft serve with pieces of chocolate chip Chips Ahoy! cookies in it. I actually got to try both of these at the exact same time. One of these things that I like is ... you know how you have that sweet and salty combination, and literally eating this Chips Ahoy! McFlurry right after the spicy nuggets is an awesome combination because you literally get the best of both worlds with the flavors," said Johnson.


   


  Additionally, on Friday, Aug. 28, the McDonald's in North Texas owners and operators celebrated their customers with a big "thank you" for the brand's first-ever Drive-thru Customer Appreciation Hour.


   


  This event lasted from 8-9 a.m., selling the fan-favorite sausage biscuit for only 50 cents from Drive-Thru purchases only.


   


  "This is the only one for now, and we definitely do not know what the future holds, but this is just our way of saying 'thank you' to the community for this period of time. We know it's been a challenge for everyone and this is just our way of saying thank you for continuing to support McDonald's," Johnson said.

In a 2010 _Spin_ review, Mikael Wood referred to “Circle the Drain” as Katy Perry’s “most convincing” track on _Teenage Dream_ , describing the song as a “techno-goth rant.” It’s a side of pop music that Perry hasn’t delved into frequently. Presumably a nod to a toxic ex-relationship, “Circle the Drain” has power. Perry sing-screams, “Wanna be your lover / Not your fucking mother / Can’t be your savior / I don’t have the power.” It’s a raw, resilient, and twisting song that shows a different side to Perry than most songs on the album, but it’s equally an ode to the more thrashing, guitar-based rock persona that Perry first introduced herself with on songs like “I Kissed a Girl” and “Waking Up in Vegas.” (Speaking of Rock-and-Roll Katy, never forget her “Thinking of You” Warped Tour performance from 2008 — another predecessor to the rock-with-a-dash-of-pop sound of “Circle the Drain.”)

I had an unexpected pastel delight in my veg patch this week, when my sweet potatoes started flowering. As luck would have it, one vine had crept around a purple-leaf basil with small edible flowers that share the same pink throats.


  I had planted them both partly for good eats and partly because they are, well, pretty plants. Multiple benefits are important in small gardens where detail is everything.


  Every year I stick out ornamental sweet potatoes, both the purple leaf and chartreuse kinds, mostly as ornamental ground covers or for spilling out of large containers. And they do make small, irregular but edible tuber roots.


  Anyway, this year I took advantage of stay-at-home orders to plant more vegetables than I usually do; most years I travel abroad and depend on stuff that doesn’t need close attention or regular watering, and depend on those that generally fare well on their own and blend well with low-maintenance flowers and shrubs.


  The easiest summer veggies that I plant as much for looks as food include gourds, several different colorful peppers and okra, with its simple hibiscus flowers and ornamental pods; I always plant the kind with burgundy leaves and pods.


  But this spring I set out scattered potager-style patches of others, including small stands of corn tied up with climbing Louisiana purple pod beans and underplanted with squash; this ancient “three sisters” combination looks good texture-wise and produces well. And I interplanted with regular sweet potatoes as a groundcover with a superb fall harvest.


  White-fruited eggplant would be fine, too, but I feel guilty not eating them. Sounds heretic, but I simply dislike the big berry’s “mouth-feel” — but then I really can’t stand slimy okra either; thank goodness for cornmeal, hot oil and ketchup! Don’t like mushrooms either, and nope, you can’t change my mind.


  My favorite culinary herbs for double duty as flowers include several different basils, oregano, chives, both shrub and cascading rosemary, and the perennial marigold called Mexican mint marigold or sometimes Mexican tarragon because its anise-flavored leaves are an excellent substitute for nearly impossible-to-grow French tarragon. The native Mexican perennial marigold is so drought hardy, and because its brilliant yellow flowers appear just in time for Day of the Dead celebrations, it’s commonly planted on Latino graves.


  With my three sisters pretty well played out now, last week I reworked their spaces and started planting fall stuff. I sowed a packet each of carrots and beets, knowing full well that the seeds cost more than I spend all year on those inexpensive foods. With a daily sprinkling, they came right up in the warm soil. In a couple of weeks, I’ll thin the plants, using the pullings in salads and leaving elbow room for the leftovers to reach their potentials. Overcrowding is one of the easiest production-busting mistakes new gardeners make.


  But I left room for seeding colorful lettuces and other greens in a couple of weeks, and for transplants of other cool-season veggies such as broccoli, cabbage and the like. It’s nearly time.


  But back to the pretty part. The big flowers of sweet potatoes prove that they are in the same family as morning glories, and look all the world like those old-fashioned reseeding petunias with pale lavender, pink and white flowers that smell so sweet.


  And to have mine flower alongside basil, the flowers of which are also white with pink tinges, was unplanned lagniappe.


  So, my summer experiment has segued into fall, and soon, with the addition of garlic and winter-hardy parsley, into winter and next spring. This forced stay-at-home is turning downright productive.

THE FACTS: No, the video wasn't taken during that storm -- or even in that part of the world. On Aug. 26, a Twitter user posted a video showing massive waves crashing against an oil rig and falsely claimed it was from Hurricane Laura. "Oil rigs evacuated ahead of soon to be Category 5 #HurricaneLaura. Potential environmental nightmare looming. Hope for the best," the user tweeted. The false post had over 1,700 retweets on Twitter. In fact, the video shows waves hitting a swaying Borgholm Dolphin installation in the North Sea, about 145 miles east of Aberdeen, Scotland. Also, the video the Twitter user posted was stretched and mirrored, which exaggerated the impact of the waves. The BBC posted video of the incident to YouTube on January 12, 2015. One of the strongest hurricanes ever to strike the U.S., Laura roared ashore Thursday in Louisiana near the Texas border and pounded the Gulf Coast with wind and rain. The hurricane's top wind speed of 150 mph (241 kph) put it among the most powerful systems on record in the U.S. Not until 11 hours after landfall did Laura finally weaken into a tropical storm as it churned toward Arkansas.

The move led to postponements in support of social justice over the past two days in Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer, the Women's NBA and the National Hockey League.


  While players weren't on the court, they were talking with NBA club owners about their desire to see the league undertake broader measures for social change, frustrated by video of Blake, a black man, being shot in the back seven times by a policeman in Kenosha, Wisconsin, as he tried to get into a car where his three children were seated.


  "We look forward to the resumption of the playoffs and continuing to work together -- in Orlando and in all NBA team markets -- to push for meaningful and sustainable change," the joint statement said.


  "We had a candid, impassioned and productive conversation yesterday between NBA players, coaches and team governors regarding next steps to further our collective efforts and actions in support of social justice and racial equality."


  Players and the NBA established a social justice coalition, with representatives from players, coaches and team owners to focus on a broad range of issues, including increasing access to voting, promoting civic engagement and advocating meaningful police and criminal justice reform.


  In cities where the NBA team owns and controls its own arena, team owners will work with local elections officials to convert the facility into a voting location for the 2020 US general election, allowing safe in-person voting options in communities fearful of COVID-19.


  If that option won't work, NBA team owners will try to find another election- related use for the arena, such as for voter registration or ballot counting.


  The league vowed to work with players and broadcast partners on advertisements in each playoff telecast dedicated to promoting greater civic engagement in elections.


  "These commitments follow months of close collaboration around designing a safe and healthy environment to restart the NBA season, providing a platform to promote social justice, as well as creating an NBA Foundation focused on economic empowerment in the Black community," the statement said.


  Silver had told league employees the measures were coming as he expressed full support for the players' walkout.


  "We are dedicated to driving the sustainable change that is long overdue," Silver wrote in an open letter to NBA employees posted on the league's website.


  "I wholeheartedly support NBA and WNBA players and their commitment to shining a light on important issues of social justice.

The first stimulus bill, the CARES Act, gave Americans $1,200, with married couples receiving a collective payment of $2,400. It also provided $500 for dependents, up to a total of three. Democrats wanted to increase that amount to $1,200 for dependents with a new bill, but Republicans are resistant to that amount, and would rather keep it the same. There has also been speculation that GOP leaders may introduce a bill that does not include direct stimulus payments at all.

People already know the CTS-V Wagon is a cool car. It's got that simple, angular look with a factory set of widebody fenders. It literally stands out straight out of the box, and many already appreciate the model. Doug DeMuro had one many years ago, and the only reason why you don't see that many project cars is the price.

The international community cannot and must not accept Turkey's behavior. So what to do? First, further aggression and naval provocations must be put to an end -- if possible through talks, when necessary through smart sanctions. The idea of a war in the Mediterranean -- and between NATO partners to boot -- seems utterly absurd. The problem is, however, that a lot of absurd things happen in this corner of the world nevertheless.

Screenshots obtained by ABC News show apparent failures in the system's artificial intelligence verification program, which is supposed to use photos to verify an ID or other form of identification. Students said the system was accepting any photo as a form of identification: In one instance, a user submitted an image of a dog, and another, a glass of what appears to be orange juice. The system approved both of those images, according to the letter.

Many baby boomers have good memories of Paul Revere and the Raiders and the Byrds, widely acclaimed pop rock bands who performed in the mid-1960s, at the Balmoral Pavilion on the southeast side of Otter Tail Lake.
 The Raiders, with lead singer Mark Lindsay, had hit songs that included “Hungry,” “Just Like Me,” “Kicks” and “Him or Me, What’s It Gonna Be?”
 The Byrds recorded “Mr. Tambourine Man” in 1965. Other hits by the Byrds included “Turn, Turn, Turn” and “Eight Miles High.”
 Wahpeton native Roger Lee, who later moved to Fergus Falls, attended the Byrds’ concert but says the Balmoral concert he best remembers is one performed by the Fabulous Flippers.
 Lee’s family had a cabin at Otter Tail Lake in the 1960s, only 5 miles from the Balmoral Pavilion.
 “I was there for the Byrds on a warm summer night,” recalls Don LeRoy, Fergus Falls High School Class of 1966. “My brother Jim’s glasses fogged up when we entered the pavilion. That’s how many bodies were stuffed in there that night.”
 Battle Lake native Barb La Valleur was manager of Glen Salts’ Battle Lake Motel where the Byrds stayed in 1965.
 “They left the remnants of interesting items in their wastebaskets when they departed from the motel,” she remembers.
 Steve Johnson, FFHS Class of 1972, was only 15 when, in 1968, he was in a band called “The Rubber Band” which filled in for Tommy James and the Shondells at Balmoral Pavilion after the Shondells’ bus broke down.
 “A great experience,” Johnson said.
 Johnson played in six different bands between 1966 and 1989, and then ran a mobile disc jockey service called Steve’s Audio Plus for 22 years. His main job was at Lake Region Hospital where, in 2016, he retired as director of materials management after 35 years of service.
 The late Ken Berg of Fergus Falls ran roller skating at Balmoral on Friday nights, along with the roller rink in Fergus Falls.
 “Wonderful memories,” says his wife, Ruth.
 Ed and Bette Prescher, who owned the Balmoral Pavilion at the southeast side of Otter Tail Lake, left a true legacy.
 The Preschers also operated Balmoral Resort that included 17 cottages. They sold the resort in 1982, which eventually made way for condominiums. In 2001, Ed and Bette closed their trailer park.
 Fire destroyed the Balmoral Pavilion in 1976, four years after the Preschers relinquished ownership.
 Cheers for Bert Blyleven
 Thirty years ago this summer I attended a communications conference in Kansas City as an employee of Otter Tail Power Company.
 One evening a few of us saw the hometown Royals host the California Angels. Pitching for California was Bert Blyleven who won the game, pitching into the bottom of the ninth inning.
 A newspaper article the same day said that it was Bert’s 20th anniversary of sorts. He pitched for the Minnesota Twins in 1970 as a 19-year-old from southern California, so he was 39 in 1990 which would make him 69 today.
 I met Angels’ outfielder Dave Winfield in our hotel gift shop in Kansas City, also in 1990. I told him I was from Fergus Falls and had seen him play basketball for the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers. He was a very nice man and gracious.
 In recent years I have enjoyed Bert as color commentator for Twins games on TV and have visited with him during Twins Winter Caravan stops in Fergus Falls. To many of us he will be best remembered as a pitcher for the Minnesota Twins who won the World Series in 1987.
 Blyleven was born in the Netherlands but was raised in Garden Grove, California, near Los Angeles. He was proud to be known as a Dutch-American baseball player.
 He was a Minnesota Twins teammate with Rothsay native and future Fergus Falls resident Dave Goltz, a pitcher just like Blyleven.

The company accomplished the goal of remerchandising a record $1.2 billion of products in the United States and is on track to complete another $1.6 billion this year. Aided by its investments in growth initiatives, Grainger expanded the U.S maintenance, repair and operating (MRO) market by 150-200 basis points (bps) in 2019. So far this year, the company has consistently outpaced the U.S MRO market.      In second-quarter 2020, Grainger outgrew the U.S MRO market by around 100 bps, highlighting the continued traction of its growth initiatives. Grainger will continue its efforts to strengthen relationships with both large- and mid- sized customers to improve sales-force effectiveness. It continues to re- engage lapsed customers and acquire new ones.      The company has witnessed a surge of COVID-19 pandemic-related product sales, such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and safety products, owing to higher customer demand. Grainger expects increased levels of safety and cleaning product sales to large healthcare, government and critical manufacturing customers in the near term. Further, the pandemic has provided a boost to Grainger’s e-commerce sales. The company is focused on improving the end-to-end customer experience by making investments in its e-commerce and digital capabilities, and executing improvement initiatives within the supply chain. Furthermore, it has undertaken several cost-control measures in the wake of the uncertainty related to the pandemic.      Grainger’s Canada business is an attractive market and is anticipated to deliver double-digit operating margin growth over the next five years. The company has been focused on reducing its cost structure in the Canada operations to drive growth, and is focused on making incremental investments in marketing and merchandising. It expects to return to growth in the business in the second half of the current year, and anticipates the business to be sustainable and profitable.
