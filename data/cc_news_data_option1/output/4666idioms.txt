Cars are in high demand here. Small vehicles piled high with a family's worldly possessions, moving in and out of the new settlements, are a common sight. And with little to no running water in Covid and other newly erected townships, the vendors who sell big buckets — to people who now have to walk long distances to fetch water — are also thriving.
 In a way, some say, this has all happened before. So-called land invasions are old hat in South Africa: The country, after all, is built on a centuries-long legacy of land dispossession.
 Most recently Apartheid in many ways created the massive economic divisions in current day South Africa. Those who are too poor have found a place to live by any means necessary.

In Cedar Rapids, Iowa, which is in a county considered a national virus hot spot, an election official who worked an early voting site later tested positive.
 “I’m actually surprised that we don’t have more cases,” said Linn County Election Commissioner Joel Miller, who noted that several county workers in his building tested positive in the last week. “It actually seems kind of far- fetched that we didn’t have more, but they might not be reporting it to us.”
 Election workers in Jackson County, Missouri, in the Kansas City suburbs, seem to be the hardest hit so far, with about 28 staffers testing positive in the past couple of weeks.
 Tammy Brown, head of the Jackson County Election Board, said her staffers urged voters who felt ill to avoid coming inside, though she suspects not everyone listened. The board dealt with nearly 200,000 voters, including more than 60,000 who cast early ballots.

Lewis Hamilton has been crowned champion of the world for a record-equalling seventh time after he won a dramatic Turkish Grand Prix. While those around him lost their cool, Hamilton delivered his best display of the season to claim his 10th win from 14 rounds and emulate Michael Schumacher&rsquo;s all-time title haul with three rounds to spare.Hamilton was running in fifth for much of an eventful race but used all of his experience to make his intermediate tyres last for 50 of the 58 laps to take the chequered flag a staggering 31.6 seconds clear of Sergio Perez, with Sebastian Vettel third and Ferrari team-mate Charles Leclerc fourth.Valtteri Bottas, the only man who could have prevented Hamilton from wrapping up the title here, endured a miserable afternoon, spinning twice and finishing 14th. Indeed, Hamilton put a lap on his crestfallen team-mate with a dozen laps to go.Hamilton&rsquo;s remarkable performance was befitting of a driver who can now claim to be the most decorated the sport has ever seen.Schumacher won his seventh title at the Belgian Grand Prix in 2004. It was a record many thought would stand the test of time.But 5,922 days later, Hamilton, the man who grew up on a Stevenage council estate, has now matched the great German with his sixth championship in seven stunning years. Hamilton also has more wins (94), more poles (97) and more podiums (163) than any driver who has gone before.After defying the odds to take pole position here, Racing Point&rsquo;s Lance Stroll led from team-mate Sergio Perez for much of the race.But the Canadian&rsquo;s afternoon began to unravel in the final third. Stroll&rsquo;s intermediate tyres were shot and after defying the pit wall&rsquo;s decision to stop for new rubber he eventually surrendered his lead on lap 37. He would finish ninth.On the same lap as Stroll&rsquo;s stop, Hamilton – now promoted to third after Sebastian Vettel took on new tyres and Alexander Albon spun in his Red Bull – was suddenly in contention to win.As he approached the 12th bend, Hamilton swooped round the outside of Perez to take the lead.From there, the 35-year-old was in a class of one. On older tyres, he lapped the 3.3 miles of recently relayed asphalt at the Istanbul Park circuit consistently faster than anybody else.It was a mesmerising performance that drew parallels with one of his finest afternoons behind the wheel of a Formula One machine, at Silverstone in 2008, when he romped to victory in similarly testing conditions.He would go on to win his maiden title that year in Brazil. In a dozen years, it is a feat he has managed to achieve on six additional occasions and must now be considered among the greatest British sportspersons of all time.Max Verstappen is the obvious heir to Hamilton&rsquo;s throne, but where the Englishman rarely put a foot wrong on Sunday, the Red Bull man blew his chance of winning when he spun while battling Perez for second. He also had to stop for new tyres three times before crossing the line in sixth.A tearful Hamilton stood on top of the machine that drove him to his seventh world championship before running over to embrace his team.&ldquo;I definitely am lost for words,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think I have to start by saying a huge thank you to all the guys here and the factory for enabling me to have this opportunity.&ldquo;The journey we have been on is monumental. I want to say a big thank you to Team LH for sticking with me for all these years and then to my family.&ldquo;We dreamed of this when I was young, when we watched the grands prix and this is way, way beyond our dreams and it is so important for kids out there to dream the impossible. You have to work, chase, and never give up or doubt yourself.&rdquo;

Four astronauts are set to lift off Sunday night from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida aboard a SpaceX rocket bound for the International Space Station.
 The crewed flight will be the second for SpaceX's Dragon capsule and the first since NASA officially certified the small spacecraft to carry people. Aboard will be NASA astronauts Mike Hopkins, Shannon Walker, and Victor Glover, along with Japanese astronaut Soichi Noguchi.
 "As a crew, we are ready," said Hopkins, the mission commander, in a press conference last week. "We are ready for this launch, we are ready for the six months of work that is waiting for us on board the International Space Station, and we are ready for the return."
 The Dragon is a relatively new ride for astronauts. Its first crewed flight took place in May, when Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken launched on a jaunt to the station. They stayed for roughly two months before returning to earth and splashing down in the Gulf of Mexico in early August.

The Houston Texans appear to like the job Romeo Crennel is doing in his month as the interim head coach, enough that the organization may shed the interim label and give him the job in 2021. Per NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, the Texans are debating making Crennel the full-time coach for next season as a "stop- gap" option, which would allow the team to get through next year -- one of uncertainty with the COVID-19 pandemic still going on.
 In-person interviews aren't guaranteed in 2021, making the interview process for head coach difficult. With interviews likely to be conducted on Zoom, this may scare franchises away from hiring a head coach to a multi-year contract -- making it easier to just go with the interim coach for a year in the hopes the pandemic clears up.
 Texans players like Crennel, which significantly helps his chances of landing the job. The oldest head coach in the NFL at 73 years old, Houston is 2-2 in the four games Crennel has coached -- with both wins coming against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Houston has averaged 28.3 points and 409.3 yards per game in the four contests Crennel has coached despite having a defense that has given up an astonishing 438.3 yards per game on defense.

From Gandhiji to JP, Bihar is a land that has inspired change. The just- concluded State Assembly elections, too, have important takeaways that should be debated, and they should lead to reforms.
 Nitish Kumar was given a spirited fight in the election by challenger Tejashwi Yadav, who almost managed to unseat the three-time Chief Minister. The two leaders and the parties they represent are a study in contrast. Nitish leads probably the only big regional formation in the country where the supreme leader has not sought to pass on the baton to some one in the family, or to a relative.
 Tejashwi, on the other hand, belongs to a family where his mother, brother and sister are among the beneficiaries of the political innings of his father and former Chief Minister, Lalu Prasad. In terms of a family doubling up as a political party, Lalu’s family is comparable to Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav’s family.
 But why single out these two families? From Jammu and Kashmir to Tamil Nadu, from Maharashtra to West Bengal, from Haryana to Andhra and Telangana, the story is the same: Entrenched political players often seek to make their families their party, and the parties they lead as their family fiefdoms.
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently said in one of his public meetings in Bihar that he and Nitish didn’t have their families to fight for the spoils of power and that they were ranged against two entrenched “Yuvrajs”.
 But not many even in the BJP have emulated what Modi has sought to project. Examples of BJP Chief Ministers and other party leaders promoting their children in politics are commonplace. Many families of political entrepreneurs have risen in the BJP too, denting the claim of being a party with a difference. Of course, nowhere is dynasty politics as institutionalised and blatant as in Congress. The party’s inability and refusal to keep pace with aspirational India has been at the cost of its health, democratic credentials and national obligations.
 Dynasties are a reality the world over. Whether it’s in business, bureaucracy, entertainment, or politics, for that matter, we often hear about ‘First Families’.
 Researchers Siddharth Eapen George and Dominic Ponattu, in a 2018 paper, note that political dynasties are present in over 145 countries. They note that nearly half of democratic countries has often elected leaders from the same family.
 Talking about India, they note that the percentage of dynast MPs grew from 1.1 per cent in 1952 to 8 per cent in 2014. That the problem of dynasty-based politics is a deep-rooted is shown up by the fact that 35 per cent of villages have been “ruled” by some dynasty or the other since Independence.
 ## Hurting democracy
 Dynasties are the antithesis of democracy and it is a global problem. South Asia has seen many prominent political dynasties. Dynasties are particularly problematic in India.
 If family-based regional parties are part of the problem, the Congress best exemplifies what ails our system.
 One of the principal reasons for the decline of the Congress has been its inability to read India’s transformation from a paternal state to an aspirational state, where entitlements are a thing of the past.
 This, however, doesn’t mean that someone born in a political family should not have a right to a career in politics.
 The Bihar results, therefore, provide us the right opportunity to craft an institutional mechanism of checks and balances to ensure that while individual rights are respected, a level-playing field for all is also created at the same time.
 While in the case of the judiciary, as also in the case of bureaucracy, we have often heard debates calling for a “cooling off” period before a retired judge or a retired bureaucrat is allowed to occupy some other office.
 In the same vein, we need to discuss political reforms. One such measure could be that an immediate family member of an elected public representative must spend seven to 10 years as a primary member of the party before s/he becomes eligible for any position either in the party or any other public office.
 Otherwise India runs the risk of getting controlled and stifled by a clutch of political families, closing the avenues for outsiders and commoners in the world of politics.
 From a world of entitlement to empowerment, India has come a long way. It’s for the political parties to show that they are in sync with India’s evolution. Bihar results should occasion a debate on the future politics in India that is open, equal, and just.

Perhaps the reason being the need to allow the soccer loving public an opportunity to concentrate on the games when they are not committed to work related business which is usually Monday to Friday. However on some rare occasions, the games are played during the midweek especially Wednesdays and Thursdays. This provision is usually meant to allow teams with the least number of games to catch up with the others. The traditional kick-off time in Zimbabwe is 1500 hours.[1]

Karl J. Recktenwald III BORDENTOWN Karl J. Recktenwald III, "Big Reck", 74, of Bordentown, NJ, passed away peacefully on Thursday, November 12, 2020 at Greenwood House in Ewing. Karl grew up in Hamilton Township and attended Kuser School through 8th grade then graduated from Steinert High School. During those years, he started his musical career with his love of the trumpet. Between Steinert and the Kiefer Band, Karl was known for his musicianship and leadership. Following high school Karl matriculated to Trenton State College as a performance major. His senior recital was herald as one of the finest in the school's history. His next step was to Graduate School and a performance career, but the Viet Nam war intervened. Karl was in the process of auditioning to Temple University and Juilliard when his number came up. He was able to enlist in the NJ National Guard. Following basic training he spent time as a bugler at Arlington Cemetery before being assigned to the Band at Sea Girt, NJ. In the middle of all this, Karl took a teaching position at Hamilton High West. At the time, the band consisted of only 15 players. A Master's degree in performance from Trenton State College and a postgraduate degree in Supervision soon followed. Over the years, Karl built this program up to be one of the finest in NJ with numerous State Honors Band performances. As the Hornet Band grew, his brother Thom joined him and together they took the band to a wide array of performance sites. From creating the Mercer County Cavalcade of Bands to the multiple performances in Hamilton, Bermuda, Walt Disney World, The Orange Bowl and Peach Bowl Parades, Nassau in the Bahamas and Niagara Falls, Canada. During this same time, Karl was an active musician playing in everything from symphonic to Latin ensembles to big band to brass quintet. During the Chicago band craze, Karl directed and created an LP of his own arrangements of their music with the Hornet students. He often spoke of the great memories that he had of his students and hoped he was instrumental in the lives of the thousands of students that his career touched. Karl and his wife, Carmela met at Hamilton High West where they worked together on the school musicals. His love of music was surpassed only by his devotion to his wife. He loved to travel. After his retirement, he and his wife travelled throughout Europe and Africa, took many Caribbean cruises, looked forward to quiet time in Indian Shores, FL, and enjoyed their magical trips to Walt Disney World with family. He also began taking old instruments and giving them a new life as lamps and tables and created "Karl's Musical Novelties". In addition, he used his woodworking skills to design and construct wooden toys that he donated each year to Toys for Tots. His love of education continued and he spent years as an adjunct professor at the College of New Jersey helping others to become music teachers. However, his greatest joy was getting his granddaughter Sammie started on playing the trumpet. Today the music stopped for Karl, but the legacy he left with countless Hornet Band members will live on in the Pride of Mercer County. Son of the late Karl J. Recktenwald Jr. and Margaret Logan Recktenwald, he is survived by his wife, Carmela Recktenwald; his daughter, Christen Karolkiewicz and her husband Michael; his granddaughter, Samantha Paige Karolkiewicz; his brother, Thomas Recktenwald and his wife Ursula; his nephew, Adam Recktenwald, his wife Leighanne, and great-niece Mila; and his nephew, Kurt Recktenwald and his wife Anna. At Karl's request, a celebration of his life will be held at a future date. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made in Karl's name to the American Cancer Society. Wm. A.

The project they produced, BearID, could help conservationists monitor the health of bear populations in various parts of the world, and perhaps aid work with other animals, too.
 They got started by looking for other animals that had gotten the deep learning treatment.

The county offered drive-thru voting for people with COVID-19 or who were quarantining because of contact with someone who was infected. When part-time workers became ill, full-time election board staff worked the drive-thru line.
 It's difficult to trace cases back to polling places because the virus manifests in different ways, and some people never get symptoms. Infections also are spiking as people gather with extended family or friends and return to more crowded public settings.
 The U.S. has recorded more than 10.8 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and over 245,000 deaths.
 While that spread increases the likelihood poll workers may have contracted the disease elsewhere, there have been calls for their co-workers to quarantine and voters to be tested as a precaution.
 In New York, more than 1,600 people who voted at a site in the Hudson Valley on Election Day have been advised to get tested after a poll worker tested positive. Officials said colleagues who had sustained contact with the worker will be tested, but they described the risk to voters as minimal because the person wore a mask, kept distance and followed other safety measures.
 Similarly, officials in Virginia's Carroll County said two poll workers in different precincts have tested positive. A health official said that because both were in their infectious periods on Election Day, testing has been offered to workers and voters.
 Virginia officials statewide had masks, face shields, gloves, hand sanitizer and other supplies for polling places, and they trained people in safety practices, said Jessica Bowman, deputy commissioner of the Virginia Department of Elections.
 It could be several weeks before the effect of in-person voting nationwide is known. Polling places that used safety measures could have greatly minimized transmission rates, perhaps making them less risky than going to a restaurant with friends, said M. Kumi Smith, an assistant professor with the epidemiology division at the University of Minnesota.
 "A super-spreader event is a lot easier to identify when you're still at an early stage of an epidemic or when there's a really discrete event that's really unlike anything else that anyone else is doing," she said. "But given the real range of activities that are going on here, I would probably be a little bit more skeptical of someone who declares that this is definitively a super-spreading event."
 No major reports of safety lapses or risky voting conditions have emerged.
 States had varying rules for masks. But even in places with mandates, officials balked at requiring face coverings while voting. Instead, they opted for a strong recommendation or offered options such as curbside voting or booths away from others.
 In Indiana, a poll worker who later tested positive did not show symptoms, practiced social distancing and "wore a mask at all times" on Election Day, said Bartholomew County Clerk Jay Phelps. As a precaution, seven colleagues are quarantining for two weeks.
 He said election officials spent a lot of time and money making polling places as safe as possible. Poll workers wore masks, and machines, tables and doorknobs were constantly sanitized.
 "We worked really hard to make sure that every polling location had protocols in place," Phelps said.

There has been no widespread fraud in the 2020 election. In fact, election officials from both political parties have stated publicly that the election went well and international observers confirmed there were no serious irregularities.
 Trump’s campaign has tried to mount legal challenges across the country, but many of the lawsuits have been thrown out and none has included any evidence that the outcome might be reversed.
 More than a week after Election Day, Trump has neither called Biden nor made a formal concession, and White House officials have insisted that they are preparing for a second term.
 In recent days, Trump appeared to be inching closer to acknowledging the reality of his loss. In comments Friday in the Rose Garden about a coronavirus vaccine, Trump said his administration would “not be going to a lockdown” to slow the spread of COVID-19, and added that “whatever happens in the future, who knows which administration it will be?

I’ve lost at golf, at tennis, at pitch, hearts, spades and poker. I have lost at chess and checkers. I have lost at pool and ping pong. I think I have lost at Monopoly, but who can tell, since most games are simply abandoned long before they conclude.
 I have lost to my beloved bride at Clue. As a result I will no longer play that board game with her. In fairness, she won’t play me in Scrabble, either.
 One thing I have never lost is an election. Of course, I’ve never run for anything, either.
 Everybody loses. If you have never lost, you have never competed.
 Nobody likes to lose. Of course if losing didn’t hurt so much winning wouldn’t be as sweet as it is.
 There are many, many inspirational quotes about losing. “You can’t win unless you learn how to lose,” said Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, former basketball great and one-time coach of the now-defunct Oklahoma Storm professional basketball team based right here in our little town.
 Microsoft founder Bill Gates said “Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can’t lose.”
 “Sometimes it is better to lose and do the right thing than to win and do the wrong thing,” said former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
 Baseball great George Brett said “If a tie is like kissing your sister, losing is like kissing your grandmother with her teeth out.” A little earthy, perhaps, but nonetheless motivational.
 There are many ways to handle losing. You can rationalize. You can claim your opponent cheated. You can blame your teammates or your equipment. You can fault the referees or the umpires. You can even blame the weather.
 But in the end there comes a point when you have to face it. You lost because your opponent did a better job than you.

Asimismo, se exhorta a la Policía Nacional a que ponga fin a la represión y que se respete la vida y los derechos humanos de las personas que vienen ejerciendo su legítimo derecho a la protesta. Cabe indicar que la movilización del último sábado es la segunda protesta luego de la vacancia contra el entonces presidente de la República, Martín Vizcarra, quien fue sucedido por Manuel Merino y cuya gestión ha sido cuestionada. Finalmente, en el oficio, se pide hacer los esfuerzos necesarios para que se busque una salida constitucional con la finalidad de devolverle la calma y la confianza a la población para de esta manera poner fin a la actual crisis política.

Bulls continue to dominate the stock of Tata Steel as it continues to register higher highs. Last week, the uptrend gained steam and the scrip rallied past the prior high of ₹443.6 and wrapped up the week at ₹492.2. Thus, the stock is hovering around the crucial level of ₹500 and a breakout of this level can intensify the rally.
 The price is well above the 21-day moving average and notably; it has crossed over the 50-day moving average — a bullish indication. Substantiating the positive trend, the daily relative strength index has been rising in tandem with the price and the moving average convergence divergence indicator on the daily chart has moved further up in the positive territory.
 Even though the major trend is bullish and the momentum is in its favour, traders need to be cautious about the resistance at ₹500 since the stock might witness some profit-booking.
 Hence, one can either buy the stock with a stop-loss of ₹477 if it breaks out of ₹500 or buy with a stop-loss at ₹450 if the price softens to ₹475. Resistance levels above ₹500 are at ₹530 and ₹550.

President Donald Trump on Sunday appeared to acknowledge for the first time that Joe Biden won the White House, but made clear he would not concede and would keep trying to overturn the election result. Trump’s statements came in tweets that included several baseless claims about the Nov. 3 vote, which state and federal officials say was safe and secure.
 Trump, without using Biden’s name, tweeted that “He won,” something Trump had not said before publicly, though he said the Democrat’s victory was only “in the eyes” of the media. Biden defeated Trump by winning back a trio of Midwestern battleground states: Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and topped the 270 electoral vote threshold to clinch the presidency. Biden so far has 77.5 million votes, the most ever by a winning candidate, to Trump’s 72.3 million.
 “If the president’s prepared to begin to recognize that reality, that’s positive,” Biden’s incoming chief of staff, Ron Klain told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Still, Klain said, “Donald Trump’s Twitter feed doesn’t make Joe Biden president or not president, the American people did that.”
 The president has previously refused to accept the results of the election and he dug in again Sunday, saying, “I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go.” Even while seemingly acknowledging Biden’s victory, he also argued without evidence that the former vice president only won because the election was “rigged.” Trump then made unsubstantiated complaints about access for poll watchers and about vote tabulations and asserted, “WE WILL WIN!” Twitter soon posted warning labels about the tweets.

There has been no widespread fraud in the 2020 election. In fact, election officials from both political parties have stated publicly that the election went well and international observers confirmed there were no serious irregularities.
 Trump’s campaign has tried to mount legal challenges across the country, but many of the lawsuits have been thrown out and none has included any evidence that the outcome might be reversed.
 More than a week after Election Day, Trump has neither called Biden nor made a formal concession, and White House officials have insisted that they are preparing for a second term.
 In recent days, Trump appeared to be inching closer to acknowledging the reality of his loss. In comments Friday in the Rose Garden about a coronavirus vaccine, Trump said his administration would “not be going to a lockdown” to slow the spread of COVID-19, and added that “whatever happens in the future, who knows which administration it will be? I guess time will tell.”
 Trump on Sunday renewed his groundless attacks on an election technology firm, Dominion Voting Systems, without evidence of any serious irregularities. Dominion has said it “denies claims about any vote switching or alleged software issues with our voting systems.”
 The Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, a federal agency that oversees U.S. election security, said in a statement last week that the “November 3rd election was the most secure in American history.” The agency said, “There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.”
 In his latest fundraising email, Trump told supporters that “we are fighting to ensure EVERY SINGLE LEGAL ballot is counted” and that he had “legal teams on the ground in every critical state.”

“We, as election officials, all knew we were at risk,” Brown said. “I don’t think this was shocking to any of us.”
 With transmission rates high in Missouri, health officials are not ready to link the cases to polling places. They say the workers could have become infected anywhere.
 The county offered drive-thru voting for people with COVID-19 or who were quarantining because of contact with someone who was infected. When part-time workers became ill, full-time election board staff worked the drive-thru line.
 It’s difficult to trace cases back to polling places because the virus manifests in different ways, and some people never get symptoms. Infections also are spiking as people gather with extended family or friends and return to more crowded public settings.

LAFAYETTE — Ryan Antoine doesn’t believe his team has reached its potential.
 “I feel like we have had chances to put teams away but haven’t,” the longtime Westgate football coach said. “We have show spurts but then we have had busted plays or miscues. I really don’t think we have shown our potential. But we are getting better in certain phases every week.”
 Westgate took another step to reaching that potential with Friday night’s 55-0 District 5-4A victory over Northside. The win was the Tigers’ third straight on the season and also its fifth straight over the Vikings.
 Westgate (5-2, 2-1) started off the game with back-to-back drives that netted the Tigers zero points. The first drive stalled in the red zone while the second one resulted in a lost fumble.
 “We had to calm the guys down and then we started to play well,” Antoine said. “That’s what we are supposed to do. We are supposed to not let up and show what we are capable of doing.”
 Westgate got things going offensively against Northside’s 4-2-5 defense with its third drive as Steven Antoine scored the first of his two rushing touchdowns. After another three-and-out by Northside (2-4, 0-3), Westgate scored again as Brennan Landry found Jordan Doucet for a 43-yard touchdown. By the end of the first quarter, Westgate led 21-0.
 Landry meanwhile completed six of seven passes for 111 yards and four touchdowns while also rushing for 43 yards and scoring two rushing touchdowns.
 “Coach Derek Landry has been doing an amazing job,” said Antoine, whose team has now scored 33 or more points in five of its seven games. “Our staff has done a very good job of putting our guys in position to make plays. We try to put our guys in one-on-one situations and to make plays.”
 While the offense put up 55 points in only three quarters, Westgate’s defense shut out Northside.
 “The defense has been playing really solid for the last couple of weeks,” Antoine said. “The guys have been flying around. We want to get all the guys to the ball. Those are the things that we try to pride ourselves on.”
 Westgate will now turn its attention to wrapping up the regular season on Thursday at home against Carencro. With a possible home playoff game on the line, Antoine is making sure his young team — which features only two seniors on offense and two more on defense — is focused to play its best game of the season.
 “We are treating this like a playoff week,” Antoine said. “They are one of the top teams in Class 4A, if not the top team. We have to be prepared and focused to host Carencro. We are going to have to play one of our better games to win this game.”
