JOHANNESBURG - The South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC) said that the apology to the Health Ministry had nothing to do with its president Glenda Gray's comments.
 On Tuesday, the council released a statement apologising to the department, following a public row between Gray and Minister Zweli Mkhize.
 Gray criticised government's handling of the lockdown, saying that its regulations were not based on scientific evidence.
 Mkhize slammed her claims, saying her comments were unbecoming.
 The department called on the council to investigate Gray, who was serving in the department's health advisory committee.
 She was then cleared and found not to have violated any of the council's policies.
 SA Medical Research Council's Jonny Mahlangu said the apology was aimed at mending relations with the ministry.
 "The board is apologising to maintain a relationship between the SAMRC and the Minister of Health because we work hand in glove with the Department of Health. It has nothing to do with what was said by Professor Glenda Gray."

LOS ANGELES -- California distributor HAAH Automotive Holdings is suspending plans to import vehicles from China's Zotye Automobile Co. until financial conditions improve in its home market.
 HAAH will now focus on a second Chinese partner, Chery Automobile Co., CEO Duke Hale told _Automotive News_. In February, HAAH announced plans to sell Chery-engineered crossovers assembled in the U.S. under the newly created Vantas brand.
 U.S. dealers who signed up to sell Zotye vehicles in the U.S. can keep their franchises while adding Vantas at no additional cost, Hale said.
 The decision marks the latest setback in Chinese automakers' attempts to establish their brands in the United States. Since the early 2000s a number of plans have been announced but so far none have been realized.
 Zotye was to have been the first Chinese brand that HAAH introduced to the U.S., starting with a low-price crossover originally slated for late 2019 or early 2020. Those plans were later pushed back to 2021. As of late last year, HAAH, of Irvine, Calif., said it had signed up Zotye dealers in 100 U.S. markets.
 Zotye's sales in China have fallen dramatically in recent months amid the coronavirus pandemic , Hale said.
 "Zotye took an enormously big hit in China," Hale said Monday in explaining the shift in business plans. He estimated its sales decline at 70 percent to 80 percent in recent months.
 "They have to focus on home and get that turned around," he added.
 HAAH could revive its U.S. plans with Zotye in the future, perhaps in two or three years, Hale said.
 "We still are good friends of Zotye," he said. "We're still working with them. We're going to work with them in Central America. And we have a long-term agreement with Zotye to bring their vehicles to the U.S. market -- when it makes sense to do so."
 But certifying Zotye vehicles for U.S. sale right now would require millions of dollars of investment, he said.
 "To tell them that we're going to spend 'X' amount of dollars to homologate the first and second vehicles -- in their current situation -- does not make a lot of sense," Hale said. "Hopefully, that starts to turn around."
 _Automotive News China_ reported that Zotye's sales had already fallen sharply in the first half of last year when it swung to a net loss of $38 million, and deliveries fell to 73,900 units, or about half what it sold in the year- earlier period.
 Reuters reported that Zotye's stock on the Shenzhen exchange was trading at around 1.9 yuan (27 cents) this week, compared with 4.6 yuan (64 cents) at the same time last year.

_Napoli, 27 mag 13:33 - (Agenzia Nova)_ \- "In merito alle notizie della condanna da parte del Tribunale Civile nei confronti del Comune di Napoli, citato da una cittadina georgiana, intendiamo specificare innanzitutto che la situazione della donna è sicuramente complessa e quantomeno singolare, dato che non ha mai presentato domanda di bonus, né si è rivolta ai servizi sociali per far conoscere la sua situazione o ottenere l'aiuto legato all'erogazione del pacco alimentare, distribuito a tutti i cittadini in difficoltà (oltre 4.000 senza alcuna distinzione riferita a residenza) che non rientravano nei requisiti del bonus spesa". Lo ha affermato in una nota l'assessora al Welfare del Comune di Napoli, Monica Buonanno. "È da considerarsi come un'eccezione - ha proseguito - in un sistema che con specifici atti ha dimostrato concretamente il supporto a tutte le fasce deboli, ivi inclusi i migranti. Abbiamo, inoltre, ascoltato e preso in carico tutte le pratiche che potessero presentare anomalie e che ci sono state indicate da associazioni, comitati e cittadini singoli, così da essere il più inclusivi possibile. Siamo amareggiati ma rigettiamo nel modo più assoluto qualsiasi accusa di discriminazione. L'amministrazione , infatti, è l'unica ad aver riconosciuto il bonus spesa così come gli altri benefici ad immigrati regolari, cittadini Rom, richiedenti asilo, destinatari di protezione internazionale e a chi è in possesso della residenza di prossimità, laddove invece altri Comuni in Italia hanno previsto come prerequisito la residenza anagrafica. A Napoli sono state presentate e accettate domande di bonus da 1.137 richiedenti asilo politico e/o rifugiati politici, 3.318 richiedenti aventi indirizzo di prossimità o non residenti a Napoli, ma con comprovate motivazioni per cui sono risultati nella città di Napoli durante il periodo di isolamento, come ad esempio, arresti domiciliari fuori dal proprio comune, allontanamento familiare o situazioni particolari".

Trump did not explain his threat Wednesday, and the call to expand regulation appeared to fly in the face of long-held conservative principles on deregulation.
 But some Trump allies, who have alleged bias on the part of tech companies, have questioned whether platforms like Twitter and Facebook should continue to enjoy liability protections as “platforms” under federal law — or be treated more like publishers, which could face lawsuits over content.
 The protections have been credited with allowing the unfettered growth of the internet for more than two decades, but now some Trump allies are advocating that social media companies face more scrutiny.
 “Big tech gets a huge handout from the federal government," Republican Sen. Josh Hawley told Fox News. “They get this special immunity, this special immunity from suits and from liability that’s worth billions of dollars to them every year. Why are they getting subsidized by federal taxpayers to censor conservatives, to censor people critical of China.”

However, as of Wednesday, the daily number of COVID-19 cases have again climbed to 40 amid the rise in cases linked to night clubs in one of the capital's neighborhoods and a logistics center west of Seoul, taking the tally to 11,265. The death toll in the country remains at 269.
 The authorities are concerned that 30 percent of people diagnosed with COVID-19 in South Korea are asymptomatic, which can lead to the untraceable spread of the virus. In addition, the current rise in daily cases comes as South Korea sends another 2.4 million students back to school. Some cities and towns have delayed school reopenings in light of the new infections.

Gold dropped to its lowest in two-weeks
 on Wednesday as hopes of quick economic recovery drove investors
 towards riskier assets, although U.S.-China tensions over Hong
 Kong put a floor under bullion prices.
 Spot gold was down 0.6% at $1,700.30 per ounce by
 1223 GMT. U.S. gold futures fell 0.8% to $1,691.80.
 "It's very important for gold prices to stay above $1,700.
 Otherwise, if the price correction continues, speculative
 investors are likely to leave this boat and increase pressure on
 prices," said Commerzbank analyst Eugen Weinberg.
 "One can mention the geopolitical tensions are contributing
 somewhat and supporting gold prices currently. But, until now
 this situation has failed to ignite fears on the equity market."
 Optimism about the development of coronavirus vaccines and a
 revival of business activity has lifted risk sentiment in the
 financial markets.
 After a batch of poor economic readings from the United
 States, data on Tuesday showed U.S. consumer confidence nudged
 up in May and new home sales beat expectations.
 Despite the pullback in bullion prices, the outlook remains
 positive for gold, which is seen as a safe-haven asset during
 times of political and economic uncertainty, analysts said.
 The risks of a temporary short-term gold market unwind to a
 low- to mid-$1,600 level seems to be rising, Citi said in a
 note, adding it remained "outright bullish (on) gold over the
 medium term and forecast that $2,000 ounce will be breached in
 the next 12 months."
 Growing political unrest in Hong Kong over Beijing's
 proposed national security laws has kept investors on edge.
 U.S. President Donald Trump said Washington was working on a
 strong response to China, adding it would be announced before
 the end of the week.
 Elsewhere, palladium eased 0.1% to $1,954.75 per
 ounce, silver fell 0.3% to $17.05 and platinum was
 steady at $839.74.

_Image:  123rf.com_      Making paneer from scratch involves curdling milk by using an acidic ingredient like buttermilk or lemon juice. The solids are then drained onto a muslin cloth and left to set. This can be quite tedious, but store-bought paneer can save the day more often than not! While most people believe that store-bought paneer is hard (and this can be true!), you can always soften it by soaking it in warm water for 15-20 minutes before cooking. Read the labels to check on shelf-life; organic options with zero preservatives will have a lesser shelf-life, and these are best. Using paneer in a curry, or scrambling it into a simple _bhurji_ , or making a sandwich filling out of it is easy.

Nielsen said that while there's a case to be made that journalism needs support, the Australian and French proposals "are very unlikely to generate anything like what journalists and publishers might imagine they will," because they amount to a tax, and such tax schemes "tend to be distorting, inefficient, complex, and vulnerable to swings in the economy" (the Reuters Institute has also received significant amounts of funding from both Google and Facebook). Attard was also skeptical that these new models would provide much benefit even if they are implemented. And Thompson reiterated some of the points he made in his newsletter on the topic, including the argument that the value Facebook and Google provide to the media in return for their content "is objectively measurable: when their content is linked to by Google or Facebook, the media entities make more money, and when it is not, they do not. That is why France had to include a provision forcing Google to not simply exit the market."

“So the models aren’t there to make the money in order to bring everyone back in,’’ he said.
 That’s not all.
 “Others are wanting to make sure all the wrinkles are ironed out in the supply chain issue that we’ve been experiencing,’’ Chucri said.
 And even when restrictions are fully lifted – whenever that occurs – there’s the question of whether people are going to feel comfortable enough to go out and sit down at a fancy restaurant or even a fast-food table.
 “I think some of it’s going to be word of mouth,’’ Chucri said, as those who have gone out spread the word about the experiences they have had.
 And then there’s the question of what people read – or don’t read – in the paper. Chucri said a story about someone contracting COVID-19 from going out to eat would get a lot of attention.
 “But, so far, so good,’’ he said.
 All this has financial implications.
 Chucri figures that the ban on in-house dining has cost restaurants statewide a collective $27 million a day in lost revenues. What that left them, he said, is what some were able to make with take-out and curbside services, a figure he said amounts to just 10% of what they were making before.
 And Chucri said he presumes that, at least for some time to come, there will be Arizonans who remain more comfortable with getting their meals from their favorite restaurants and taking them home.

 At at Feb. 27 meeting of the city’s Park Advisory Board, held before the pandemic closed or limited many local businesses for several weeks, officials said the tax would generate an estimated $100,000 per year for the parks and recreation department. While the proposition doesn’t require the money to be spent in a particular area, the Union Board of Aldermen voted for it to support the parks department.
 Any money raised over $100,000 would go to the city’s general fund.
 “I get it, nobody likes taxes, but, obviously as consumers, our shopping habits are changing,” Assistant City Administrator James Schmieder said at the meeting. “And I think that as we go forward, be it more fuel-efficient vehicles or MODOT with the gas tax ... with the upgrade in technology and changing consumer habits, we have to respond accordingly. And online shopping is probably here to stay.”
 Others added that the use tax would assist small local businesses that now are at a disadvantage because they charge customers city sales taxes.
 The money raised for the parks department would be dedicated to park maintenance, Keith said.
 Only residents within the city limits will vote on the tax or pay for it if it passes, Schmieder said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday threatened social media companies with new regulation or even shuttering a day after Twitter added fact checks to two of his tweets.
 The president can’t unilaterally regulate or close the companies, which would require action by Congress or the Federal Communications Commission. But that didn't stop Trump from angrily issuing a strong warning.
 Claiming tech giants “silence conservative voices,” Trump tweeted, “We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen.”
 And he repeated his unsubstantiated claim — which sparked his latest showdown with Silicon Valley — that expanding mail-in voting “would be a free for all on cheating, forgery and the theft of Ballots.”
 Trump and his campaign angrily lashed out Tuesday after Twitter added a warning phrase to two Trump tweets that called mail-in ballots “fraudulent” and predicted that “mail boxes will be robbed,” among other things. Under the tweets, there is now a link reading “Get the facts about mail-in ballots” that guides users to a Twitter “moments” page with fact checks and news stories about Trump’s unsubstantiated claims.
 Trump replied on Twitter, accusing the platform of “interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election” and insisting that “as president, I will not allow this to happen.” His 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, said Twitter’s “clear political bias” had led the campaign to pull “all our advertising from Twitter months ago.” Twitter has banned all political advertising since last November.

Ensure the meat is packed recently and comes from a brand that promises effective storage. You will also need to freeze and store the meat at a temperature of below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, but lean meats can typically last for around six months. Red meats like beef, veal, pork and lamb can last for a year. Don't opt for processed meats like sausages, but if you do, consume them within a month or two--fish last around three months in a freezer.

Ready- to-eat foods are those that are already pre-cooked, and other than perhaps reheating it, there is no need to do anything else. Ready-to-cook foods, on the other hand, are foods where essential ingredients have been prepared, and you don't need to start from scratch with basic raw material. These time- saving packaged foods can take hours of your workload, without significantly impacting any nutrient consumption. Let's take a look.

TOKYO (AP) — Japan’s Cabinet approved a proposed 32 trillion-yen ($296 billion) supplementary budget Wednesday to help fund $1.1 trillion in measures to cushion the blow to the economy from the coronavirus pandemic.
 The extra funding under consideration includes support for small businesses, funding for improved medical systems and subsidies for local governments. The budget also will pay for measures to help prepare for possible future waves of infections.
 Japan’s economy, the world’s third largest, slipped into recession in the last quarter and was already slowing before the pandemic hit thanks to weakening global demand and consumer spending.
 The combined stimulus enacted so far amounts to a total of more than 230 trillion yen ($2.1 trillion), or about 40% of Japan's economy, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told a meeting of officials on Wednesday.
 “I will defend the Japanese economy at any cost against this once-in-a-century crisis,” Abe said.
 A pandemic state of emergency still in effect for Tokyo and several other areas ended Tuesday as the government began trying to get back to business.

Dots or stick figures “doesn’t really tell you very much about who these people were, the lives that they lived, what it means for us as a country,” said assistant graphics editor Simone Landon. So she came up with the idea of compiling obituaries and death notices of victims from newspapers across the country.

 Democrats have objected all along to continued routine business by the Republican-controlled Legislature while they say crucial pandemic-related issues are left unresolved. Key among those is the question of aid to what may now be 600,000 Arizonans who have lost their jobs.

Further control is afforded by an onboard computer, which powers the scooter's LCD screen—the hub for setting the speed limiter, turning on and off cruise control and more. To navigate the LCD screen, riders use the menu and power buttons, which are positioned on top of one another and next to the throttle. From there, you can set a speed limit, opt in or out of push to start (which requires you to kick off, like you would on a manual scooter, before the throttle takes over), and switch between miles per hour or kilometers per hour. These touches can make using the scooter a more personalized experience and less like renting one from an app.

Kent's £4bn tourism economy could lose up to 80% of its annual income this year, it has been claimed.

 Casualties include Margate's Dreamland attraction, with 52 staff laid off.
 Visit Kent said the social distancing restrictions would mean businesses having to operate with far less capacity causing an impact on revenue.
