A: To be completely honest with you, no, I haven’t really spent much time thinking about individual things, especially personally. At some point maybe later down the road, I’ll stop and look back on a lot of things. But my mindset is always kind of looking ahead at what’s coming up, and right now, we have the Steelers rolling into town. Any kind of personal or individual things that may be special to anyone directly in my family individually, that’s for down the road for me.

According to a report from Yahoo!'s Pete Thamel, the Big Ten Council of Presidents and Chancellors could be getting together for a re-vote potentially in the coming days.
 This will all stem around a medical presentation put together by the league's Return to Competition Taskforce and top medical advisors. If what they present sways enough Presidents and Chancellors to change their initial August vote, a re-vote could happen by as early as Sunday.
 The Big Ten has said the initial vote back in August was 11-3 not to play. Six Presidents and Chancellors would have to change their initial vote in order to meet the league's 60 percent voting threshold.
 The thought now is a possible Oct. 17 start to the season, which would give teams five weeks to prepare.
 This would presumably allow eight games to be played over nine weeks with a championship game on Dec. 19.
 There are a lot of unknowns still, but the breakthroughs with rapid testing have played a big factor in pushing things forward.
 Nebraska recently announced they have a rapid testing deal in place, while both the Big 12 and Pac-12 conferences have one as well. It's presumed the Big Ten would also have to have one in place in order to resume competition.

“The impact would be felt by businesses large and small, across multiple sectors. In the worst case scenario, this could mean that a small tech start up in Germany would no longer be able to use a US-based cloud provider. A Spanish product development company could no longer be able to run an operation across multiple time zones. A French retailer may find they can no longer maintain a call centre in Morocco.”
 Facebook’s no stranger to using small businesses as a makeshift shield when it’s looking to dodge some weighty regulations or curry favour among the parties trying to pass them. But none of these imaginary international companies are the subject of the EU watchdog’s ire right now — Facebook is. And Facebook, even in the best-case scenario, has a lot of money on the line here. If it doesn’t want to constantly fork over a percentage of its revenue in fines to the European government, it needs to make a good-faith effort to actually cut off these transatlantic data flows from the roughly 400 millon Facebookers based in the region.
 Because “data” is kind of a squishy term, technically everything from hiring protocols to cloud services would need to be upended under Ireland’s proposal, since these sorts of jobs often run the risk storing some sort of data from the EU in one of Facebook’s servers. And as the Journal points out, these same stipulations could easily be floated to just about every other major tech company, even if Facebook pushes back. And like Facebook _also_ pointed out, taking this stipulation one step too far has the potential to completely upend trillions of dollars expected to pass between the U.S. and EU digital markets this year. And considering how our trade deals with the region have grown kinda frosty under Trump’s tenure, it’s safe to say that this kind of shock to our e-economy is the last thing we really need right now.
 Granted, all of this is the worst-case scenario. Ireland’s data watchdog gave Facebook until “mid-September” to respond to the order, as sources close to the deal told Bloomberg. Once they do, the commission plans to send out a new draft of the order to the 26 other data authorities across the EU for “joint approval” from all sides.
 But right now, Facebook isn’t proposing any solutions; it’s leaving it to the EU to come up with a legislative answer that meets privacy standards while also allowing Facebook to bring data to its U.S. servers. And as long as it demands that, it’s admitting that it will always put profits over privacy.

All eyes were on the Kansas City Chiefs and Houston Texans on Thursday night, as Patrick Mahomes and Deshaun Watson kicked off the 2020 NFL season. There were plenty of things to be curious about: Would play be sloppy due to no preseason? Would the limited fans in attendance make a difference? And then of course, what kind of COVID-19 precautions would be taken? While plenty of team employees and assistants wore face masks, it was Andy Reid's face shield that stole the show.
 The Chiefs head coach opted to wear the clear face shield that connected to his hat, and it didn't take long for it to fog up. Social media had plenty of fun with "Big Red's" inability to see while coaching, and it also had other coaches around the league reconsidering their masks for when teams kick off on Sunday. Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh noticed someone had placed a face shield in his office this week, and he considered using it this weekend since his glasses fog up in humid weather. After seeing Reid, however, Harbaugh is going back to the drawing board.
 "I dismissed that after last night," Harbaugh said with a smile on Friday, via ESPN's Jamison Hensley.

A: I don’t think anything is ever a finished process. I think we’re always working on refining and improving as a team. I’m pleased with the way the guys have worked. We have had a physical training camp, we have been hard on the guys. That’s to get them physically, mentally, emotionally ready for the games they are going to play. Especially a game like playing the Pittsburgh Steelers. These guys practice hard now. You talk to the guys who have played or coached in Pittsburgh, Mike (Tomlin) gets the guys ready. They have a hard training camp. They hit on each other a lot, they get after it. They don’t back down from contact. That’s the culture and the identity they’ve had as an organization for as long as they have been around. In terms of us and our own culture, our identity is still being formed. That will keep on being formed throughout this year. Like I said, we’re always looking to improve. We’re always looking to build on what we’ve done. You never arrive, you’re never settled, you’re never satisfied. It’s important for us to go out every day, like we did yesterday and like we are going to do today and improve on the day before.

By the time Rubin was twelve years old, he already was putting together the band that became the Inoculated Canaries (it was, he explains, around the time of the bird flu.) They recorded their first EP The Blue Laws in 2013, when he was thirteen, with the band originally being influenced by the adventurous music of Pink Floyd and Frank Zappa, with elements of prog-rock. “As a thirteen year old I listened to a lot of weird music, so the band kind of reflected that. Then as I got older, I got kind of more focused on my songwriting, and it was music that was palatable. I was a School of Rock student for six or seven years, so I grew up playing the same stuff my dad used to listen to. Then I think the real shift in the Canaries happened when I went from listening to Zappa and Steely Dan and started listening to more modern stuff, like Foo Fighters and Tame Impala.”
