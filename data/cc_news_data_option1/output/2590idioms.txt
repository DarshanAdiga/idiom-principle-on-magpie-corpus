BERLIN (AP) ‚Äî The United States and South Africa have both reported record new daily coronavirus infections, with U.S. figures surpassing 50,000 cases a day for the first time, underlining the challenges still ahead as nations press to reopen their virus-devastated economies.
 The U.S. recorded 50,700 new cases, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University, as many states struggled to contain the spread of the pandemic, blamed in part on Americans not wearing masks or following social distancing rules.

 Warnock, a Democrat, entered the race in January for the seat now held by Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who succeeded retired Sen. Johnny Isakson on an interim basis that same month.
 Under unique rules that apply to the race, Loeffler and Warnock are among 21 candidates who will be on the ballot in a November free-for-all being conducted without the benefit of party primaries. If no one receives more than 50% of the vote ‚Äì a virtual certainty in such a crowded field ‚Äì the top two vote-getters will square off in a runoff in January.
 Warnock‚Äôs second-quarter fund-raising totals give him more than $4.3 million since he filed his candidacy with the Federal Election Commission.

Barr had initially scheduled five executions set to begin in December, but some of the inmates challenged the new procedures in court, arguing that the government was circumventing proper methods to wrongly execute inmates quickly. The executions were rescheduled last month after an appeals court threw out a lower court ruling that put the executions on hold. This week, the Supreme Court refused to block the executions.
 The executions are scheduled to resume as the country is still battling a major coronavirus pandemic and the number of inmates infected at jails and prisons across the U.S. is approaching 50,000 nationwide, according to data by The Associated Press and the Marshall Project. But federal officials have insisted that precautions will be put in place ‚Äî including temperature checks and a requirement to wear masks ‚Äî and that they are obligated to carry forward sentences imposed in the court system.
 The federal prison system has struggled to combat the coronavirus pandemic behind bars. As of Wednesday, there were five confirmed coronavirus cases at USP Terre Haute, the prison where the executions are scheduled to take place. One inmate there has died.
 Hartkemeyer argues that he must be present at the execution to be a spiritual guide for Purkey and to provide ‚Äúspiritual consolation and compassion to him during this time, helping him attain peace of mind as he leaves this life.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs vital that I be there, as Wes‚Äôs priest, to ensure this peaceful transition from life to death during his most dire moment of distress ‚Äî his ultimate crisis ‚Äî as he sits at the threshold of death," he wrote. "I will chant from behind a plexiglass barrier to ensure his peace of mind while passing and, through my physical presence, serve as a spiritual reminder to Wes of all the religious lessons I have taught him as he passes on from this life. This is my sacred duty.‚Äù
 But he argues that means risking his own life. If he couldn‚Äôt be there, it would ‚Äúconstitute a troubling violation of my religious tenets and priestly obligations,‚Äù the lawsuit says.
