Tyler nominated Janelle and Kaysar, and as much as one wants to root for Tyler he has an heir of arrogance in him, similar to what Dr. Will said about Kaysar in BB7 that Tyler is unaware of. Being cocky is not a good luck because you don’t have the same level of charisma as Dr. Will to get away with things. Pump the brakes on that a bit, it’s the reason the fans liked you on BB20, but they didn’t love you. You haven’t won the game yet, and you’re not playing with the best of the best in the game if we’re being totally honest, if Dan, Derrick, Danielle Reyes, Dr. Will, Vanessa, Rachel Reilly were in that house, your tail would have been eaten alive. I need a power shift America because I’m so bored right now, and we’re only in week 3 of the game.

Yes, I know I’m complaining a bit much, but we’ve waited 14 years for “All- Stars” and the level of gameplay has been so disappointed I cannot explain it with words. Da’Vonne has terrible reads on the house; her paranoia has turned her into a major target in the house much sooner than expected. Ian is a lapdog and still playing the same game he played in BB14, Kevin continues to whine nonstop, Dani is so delusional with her lies I don’t understand what game she is playing, Memphis is grumpy as hell, and its Janelle and Kaysar against the entire house. Thank you so much Nicole Anthony (that is sarcasm by the way).

Guillory said he hopes those stranded can be rescued later Thursday but he fears that blocked roads, downed power lines and flooding could delay that process.With more than 290,000 homes and businesses without power in the two states, near-constant lightning provided the only light for some.Officials said search and rescue missions would begin as soon as conditions allowed, along with damage assessments.The National Hurricane Center said the storm, which intensified rapidly Wednesday before plowing into land with sustained winds of 150 mph (241 kph), came ashore at 1 a.m. CDT as a Category 4 hurricane near Cameron, a 400-person community about 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of the Texas border."Potentially catastrophic impacts will continue," forecasters said in an ominous warning.Early Thursday, Laura was centered about 30 miles (50 kilometers) north-northwest of Lake Charles and moving north at 15 mph (24 kph). It weakened to a Category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph (195 kph) a few hours after making landfall.More than 580,000 coastal residents were under orders to flee in the largest evacuation since the coronavirus pandemic began and many did, filling hotels and sleeping in cars since officials didn't want to open mass shelters and worsen the spread of COVID-19. Forecasters expected a weakened Laura to move northward through Louisiana and cause widespread flash flooding in states far from the coast. After turning eastward and reaching the Atlantic Ocean, it could again become a tropical storm and threaten the Northeast.But in Cameron Parish, where Laura came ashore, officials said at least 150 people refused pleas to leave and planned to weather the storm in everything from elevated homes to recreational vehicles. The result could be deadly since forecasters said the parish could be completely covered by ocean water."It's a very sad situation," said Ashley Buller, assistant director of emergency preparedness. "We did everything we could to encourage them to leave."Becky Clements, 56, didn't take chances; she evacuated from Lake Charles after hearing that it could take a direct hit. With memories of the destruction almost 15 years ago by Hurricane Rita, she and her family found an Airbnb hundreds of miles inland."The devastation afterward in our town and that whole corner of the state was just awful," Clements recalled Wednesday. "Whole communities were washed away, never to exist again."Forecasters expected a weakened Laura to move northward through Louisiana and cause widespread flash flooding in states far from the coast. After turning eastward and reaching the Atlantic Ocean, it could again become a tropical storm and threaten the Northeast.Laura hit the U.S. after killing nearly two dozen people on the island of Hispaniola, including 20 in Haiti and three in the Dominican Republic, where it knocked out power and caused intense flooding.Laura was the seventh named storm to strike the U.S. this year, setting a new record for U.S. landfalls by the end of August. The old record was six in 1886 and 1916, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.___Deslatte reported from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Plaisance from Stephensville, Louisiana.

"It's not some kind of secret society," Brown said.
 Committeewoman Amalia Duarte said she shared Curtis’ concerns.
 “I share those worries about losing the current responsiveness and quality of service provided by our DPW (Department of Public Works), as on display after Tropical Storm Isaias,” Duarte said on the Mendham Township Democrats website. “I have asked for additional residents to be appointed to the Finance Subcommittee, which is behind this proposal. A broader perspective and diversity of opinions is needed on this important subcommittee, beyond the core of current and former Township Committee members.”
 Neibart said the finance subcommittee is considering savings in all departments.
 “We have been incredibly transparent,’ Neibart said.
 Michael Broderick, a township resident who is the Teamsters local representative for the public works employees, said other towns have considered privatizing but found it would not save money.
 "Towns have found that savings are not possible," Broderick said. "Future costs will increase (with a private contractor). Place your trust in the way the public works department works now."
 In another matter, Duarte was the only committee member wearing a protective mask and one resident, Mike Merritt, said all should be protected. Merritt said evidence shows that COVID-19 may spread further than believed through the air.
 “Any open meetings should be only with face masks required of all participants,” Merritt said.
 Apart from Duarte, other officials did not indicate they will wear face masks at future meetings.
 In other matters, the Township Committee voted unanimously to extend the contract with Cornerstone Architectural Group, not to exceed $43,050, for work on proposals to provide more space to the police and municipal services and a new library.
 The original proposal set a limit of $22,000, and $10,000 was added to include work on a potential state grant for library construction.
 The committee also unanimously approved an agreement for New Jersey American Water Company to pay the township $89,720.04 for restoration of pavement damage caused by pending water main replacement work on Cold Hill Road.
 The committee also voted to prohibit parking on Cramer Lane and Combs Hollow Road, which have experienced ongoing problems with overflow parking by visitors to Buttermilk Falls. A second reading and public hearing is scheduled for Tuesday, Sept. 8.
