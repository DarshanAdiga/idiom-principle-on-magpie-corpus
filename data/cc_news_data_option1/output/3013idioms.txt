Gyms have been closed for a long time. Workout classes canceled, snacks consumed. General physical movement, constrained. I've, unsurprisingly, put on some weight since March, struggling to find the right kind of workout that I can do on my own steam, in my own apartment. Destroying most of my excuses, one of those workouts was delivered to my door: _BoxVR_ , alongside an Oculus Quest kit.
 VR workouts have been around for a few years, but with lighter and wireless hardware finally here, the case for them has strengthened. _BoxVR_ was at the vanguard, launching over three years ago. It's now available across most VR platforms including Steam, PlayStation Store and the Oculus Store,. While there's now further DLC content -- my other reason for testing it all out -- the central posit hasn't changed.

If you're serious about Nintendo Switch gaming, chances are you probably own a Pro Controller. It's been our favorite Switch controller here at Engadget pretty much from the start, with senior editor Devindra Hardawar calling it "a solid alternative for gamers" and "a must-have if you're into fighting games." We appreciate its built-in D-pad and the overall in-hand feel. However, we're less fond of its $70 price tag -- which is less of a problem if you keep your eyes peeled for a sale.
 With three years since its release, we'd love to know how you feel about your Pro Controller. How much better is it than your Joy-Cons, and what are your favorite games to play with it? Are there any issues that other Switch players should know about? And where does it stack up among other gamepads, both previous Nintendo-made controllers and those built for competing systems like the PS4 and Xbox One? Tell us all of this and more in a user review on our Pro Controller product page. The most interesting and insightful reviews may be included in an upcoming review roundup, so give your strongest takes on this pricey first-party gamepad.

DAGSBORO — Growth in Dagsboro has copped attention.      Town of Dagsboro officials and consultants plan to take a conceptual look at possible expansion of police department headquarters and creation of a new Town Hall entrance that incorporates adjoining property gifted to the town.      During Town Council’s July 20 meeting, discussion centered on expanding the existing police department building to include a new evidence room and possibly a meeting room area. Town leaders are also considering additional parking and a new entrance, utilizing the gifted Main Street property immediately to the south.      “I think it looks to me like you could extend from the existing police department, remove the storage shed such as it is and extend the building straight towards the south into that lot and do a (90-degree turn) and come toward Main Street,” said Town Councilman William Chandler III.      Councilman Chandler added that this would not only provide additional space for the police department but might even accommodate a meeting room of sufficient size to “actually have some of our council meetings there.”      Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, council had held its meetings at the Bethel Center on Clayton Street.      An L-shaped pole building is one option for the space.      “We are at conceptual plans for all that at this point,” said Dagsboro town administrator Cindi Brought.      Kyle Gulbronson, the town’s AECOM consultant, said previous brainstorming with Ms. Brought focused on a new entrance to replace the one close to the often busy Main Street/Clayton Street intersection.      “It might be a good thing to look at making the entrance to the municipal complex there a little bit further south, so it is a little bit further away from the intersection,” said Mr. Gulbronson. “You’re in the town center district, so the setbacks are really small to start with. So, you’ve got a lot of usable space there.”      The property was gifted to the town with the stipulation that the town demolish the existing structure on it — which it did — and the land be used for improvements, Ms. Brought said.      “I definitely agree with closing off that first entrance there closest to the Town Hall,” said Councilwoman Theresa Ulrich.      “I like the idea of expanding the police department and having a meeting room and additional parking,” Councilman Patrick Miller added.      Mayor Brian Baull agreed that the police department is in need of growth.   “Obviously, the police department needs to expand,” he said. “I definitely agree that if we can get that entrance closest to the traffic light closed off, I think that would be a huge help for everybody.”      Mayor Baull suggested that the proposal proceed with a creation of a committee to see “what we can lay out on paper, and most importantly, where would the funding come from?”      The hope is to formally put something together for council’s consideration at its next meeting in September. Town Council is not scheduled to meet in the month of August.

It's been a long time coming, but you'll only have to wait a few more weeks to play the first Battletoads game since the mid-'90s. We first learned about Battletoads in 2018 and while the initial plan was to release it last year, a new trailer tries to make the case that it was worth an even longer wait.The game has a distinct look, thanks to its hand-drawn visuals. There should be plenty to keep you on your toes here, too. It'll jump between different genres, including platformer, shoot 'em up and, of course, beat 'em up. There are both 2D and 3D levels, and there's a new take on the notoriously tough Turbo Tunnel stage from the original game. Battletoads supports three- player couch co-op, so you can rope in a couple of friends or family members to help you get through some of the chaotic action.Battletoads will drop on Xbox One and PC on August 20th. Xbox Game Pass members can pre-load it now.

All of our cells (barring a few small exceptions) have the same two full copies of our genome. However, in order for the more than 200 different cell types in our body to perform different functions, not all of the genes can be active (or expressed) in every cell type. Gene expression is regulated by the binding of transcription factor proteins to short stretches of DNA, referred to as regulatory elements, that serve as on/off switches for gene expression. The ability of genes to be turned on and off allows for unique combinations of genes to be expressed in each different cell type.

HAVANA (AP) — Eusebio Leal Spengler, who oversaw the transformation of crumbling Old Havana to an immaculately restored colonial tourist attraction, becoming the de-facto mayor of the historic city center and one of the nation’s most prominent public intellectuals, has died. He was 77. He had been fighting cancer. Leal and his restoration efforts became so famous along the crowded streets of Havana that it often felt like he was holding court when he appeared in public, usually in his trademark, simple gray dress shirts and slacks. Elderly women would tell Leal that the water that had stopped working in their apartment was back on thanks to him. Others would lodge complaints about their living situation or praise him for reviving Old Havana. “To call it reconstruction of something that seemed dead and buried may draw dirty looks and dismissals that ours is a romantic crusade,” Leal wrote in a city bulletin in 2010. “But if that were the case, we wouldn’t feel embarrassed to be seen as romantics in times that are so apocalyptic.” Born in Havana on Sept. 11, 1942, Leal earned a doctorate in historical sciences from the University of Havana, honing his skills as an intellectual entrepreneur who recognized that the resurrection of the city’s historic district could be a moneymaker. That became especially important when communist Cuba embraced foreign tourism en masse after the disbanding of the Soviet Union and the loss of its billions of dollars in annual subsidies to the island brought the economy to the brink of total collapse. After a series of nationwide economic reforms and the Dec. 2014 declaration of detente with the U.S., Leal’s government-driven restoration of Old Havana gained momentum with the opening of hundreds of private businesses from elegant restaurant to art galleries that filled...

Rispetto allo stesso periodo del 2019 la riduzione è rilevante, pari a – 45%, ma si tratta ovviamente di un dato ampiamente atteso, visto il cima di incertezza che ancora condiziona i piani occupazionali delle imprese e visto anche che, in questo periodo negli scorsi anni, molte offerte di lavoro provenivano dal comparto del turismo che oggi è tra quelli più in sofferenza. Nel mese di luglio comunque sono state previste 910 assunzioni (contro le quasi 1.800 del luglio 2019). Si tratta per il 18 %, di assunzioni con contratto a tempo indeterminato (erano il 21% un anno fa) mentre il restante 82 % è con contratti a termine. Le imprese che prevedono assunzioni sono pari all’8 % del totale (erano il 12% nel 2019).”

HILLTOWN, Penn. (KYW/CNN) – Body camera footage shows the heroics of two police officers and a riding instructor who rescued a horse from a burning barn.The rescue happened last week at Red Wing Farm in Pennsylvania. Friends and workers had already gotten all the other horse outs of the barn to safety, but Phoebe was spooked by the flames.When he arrived, officer Matthew Reiss didn’t think twice before running into the barn to help the distressed horse. Officer Kristian Hanus also quickly jumped in to help.“The adrenaline was pumping,” Hanus said.The two officers entered the barn and worked to get Phoebe to safety, attempting to coax the horse out of the building.“She was definitely terrified,” riding instructor Lena Obernesser said. “The cops were fantastic though. They jumped right in … Thank God they were here.”Obernesser also took part in the rescue, removing her shirt to cover Phoebe’s eyes.The trio was finally able to get the horse out of the barn, with Obernesser pushing her from behind and the officers using a rope to pull her out.“There was an absolute moment of excitement and an adrenaline dump that we were successful,” said Reiss.Phoebe is doing great a week after the ordeal and the farm is still calculation the extensive damages. However, they say their community is rallying around them and providing donations and shelter for their horses.“They really stepped up, we had so many people reaching out,” Obernesser said. “… I was so proud to be a part of this community.”Obernesser and the officers aren’t the only heroes in the story.The farm’s owner said a family friend, Eric Hayes, got most of the other horses out, but he was injured in the fire. He is currently recovering from second and third-degree burns.Copyright 2020 KYW via CNN. All rights reserved.
