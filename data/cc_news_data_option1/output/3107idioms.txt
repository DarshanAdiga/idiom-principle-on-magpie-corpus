When passenger services resumed last year after a quarter of a century, the firm had hoped to transport 500 people per week.
 Conservative MP Mr Stevenson said: "I think it's not unexpected sadly. It is a consequence of Covid-19.
 "We had great hopes. A year ago everything was set for a very successful airport as Loganair was in and investment had gone in."
 Stobart said it was "confident the airport has an important regional economic role to play in the long term" but admitted its current situation was "challenging".
 The firm added it was "reluctantly, but unavoidably, engaged in consultations with our team about reductions in staff numbers".

Compounding the problem is that "Ohio law also provides no meaningful guidance on what it means for an official to 'compare' the signatures on a ballot and registration form," according to the LWV's legal complaint. As a result, it appears election boards are using a variety of different standards to judge signature matches, the LWV argues. "We're asking the court to say the way this is being done right now is unconstitutional and order changes, and those changes should be universal across all 88 [of Ohio's boards of election]," Miller said.

Another high-use surface that is exposed to a bacteria from a number of food items, dishes and other objects is the kitchen countertop, although it is wiped down several times a day. Kitchen counters are found to be dirtiest near the sink as this is where dirty dishes are piled up and food is washed. This area is also often washed with the same sponge used to scrub used dishes, spreading the germs all over the countertop. Use a natural, bioenzyme-based cleaner to clean your countertop before wiping down with a dry cloth.

India is now the second largest market for Zoom, after the US, according to Eric S Yuan, CEO of Zoom.&amp;nbsp; Founded in 2011, the platform has seen boom in usage during the COVID-19 pandemic as people took to working from home and schools moved online.Between January and April, the video conferencing platform has seen a 6,700 percent growth in free user sign ups in India. &quot;I think Zoom will have great DNA in India&quot;, Yuan said, at TiE&amp;rsquo;s India Internet Day Summit, as Zoom&amp;rsquo;s COO Aparna Bawa and President of Product and Engineering Velchamy Sankarlingam are of Indian origin.In July, Zoom announced that it would be setting up a new technology centre in Bengaluru and hire key talent over the next few years to expand its presence in India.While the platform continues to report an unprecedented increase in usage, it has been under attack on privacy and security issues.Earlier this year, incidents of &amp;lsquo;zoom bombing&amp;rsquo; surfaced after the FBI said it has received multiple reports of Zoom conferences being disrupted by pornographic and/or hate images and threatening language during sessions in schools and colleges. The incident led to an apology by Yuan and a disclosure that the service was not end-to-end encrypted yet.&amp;ldquo;The crisis has completely changed our user base dynamics. My biggest mistake as a CEO was that we did not have an IT team for online classes. We shared the meeting ID without any password and that was a huge mistake. We should have also played a role of IT for these schools and for our first time users&amp;rdquo; Said Yuan.The video conferencing company offers free services K-12 schools in around 25 countries, including India. With 18 data centres in different parts of the world, most of the revenue still comes from North America, primarily US and Canada. Europe is a nascent market while the India business is growing.Talking about the future of Zoom, Yuan said that he wants the company to expand more globally and introduces new features for enterprise businesses as well as first-time new users. The platform saw an uptick in new use cases like telemedicine, online classes, happy hours zoom wedding and others.&amp;ldquo;We are not there yet, but in future plan to have features like real time language translation using artificial intelligence, and features that allow users smell, touch and more, giving work from home a better experience than face to face meetings&amp;rsquo;Recalling his days as Vice President at Cisco Webex, Yuan said, &amp;ldquo;I was 27 and Corporate Vice President of Cisco-WebEx. It was a year before I left the company when in the feedback we came to know that WebEx did not have a single happy customer. So I felt embarrassed. The WebEx Cisco collaboration wasn&amp;rsquo;t a good service to customers.&amp;rdquo;The idea for Zoom came from a simple mantra, &amp;ldquo;The goal was simple, a better service bringing happiness back to these customers,&amp;rdquo; noted Yuan.

Bihar-cadre Indian Police Service (IPS) officer Vinay Tiwari, who was in Mumbai to investigate Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput's death, returned to Patna on Friday after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) exempted him from the mandatory quarantine.Tiwari had reached Mumbai to probe Rajput's death on August 2 and was asked by the civic body to remain under 14-day home quarantine, as per the Maharashtra government's rule for domestic air travellers. Authorities took the decision to exempt him after Bihar police wrote a letter to them to facilitate Tiwari's return to Patna."I would say I wasn't quarantined, the investigation was quarantined. Investigation of Bihar police was obstructed," Tiwari said before leaving, according to news agency ANI. Bihar police wrote to BMC after the Nitish Kumar-led government recommended the transfer of Rajput's death case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) earlier this week. The central agency registered a first information report (FIR) in the case on Thursday.Tiwari was advised to travel to the Mumbai airport using precautionary measures against the raging coronavirus outbreak, including personal protective equipment (PPE) items.The IPS officer came to Mumbai to probe Rajput's death after the actor father registered a case in Patna against Rhea Chakraborty, accusing her of abetting his son's alleged suicide in June.As Tiwari's quarantine lead to a turf war between the police forces of Bihar and Maharashtra and a political war of words, the Supreme Court said BMC's move had not sent the right message "despite the fact that Mumbai Police has a good professional reputation". The top court made the observation during a hearing of a plea by actor Rhea Chakraborty seeking transfer of the case registered in Bihar's capital of Patna to Mumbai.Mumbai Police are also probing the case after the actor was found dead in his Bandra apartment on June 14 following which the Maharashtra government ordered an investigation into his death.Four personnel of Bihar police, who were in Mumbai since July 27 to investigate Rajput's death, also flew back to Patna on Thursday.

The firm demands a 30% cut of all sales - including subscription sales - through its store, and recently became embroiled in a public row with an email app developer whom it threatened with removal from the store over subscription fees.
 Apple's app store rules also ban any app with "a store-like interface", and explicitly only allows these types of apps if they are a "remote desktop" - a streaming copy of a device from far away.
 That has been a problem for other gaming services in the past. Examples include Valve's Steam Link app, which displays a copy of the person's personal computer on a phone or tablet somewhere else in their home, or the Shadow gaming app, which gives users an entire remote computer to use.
 A Shadow spokesperson told The Verge that it had originally found itself in a disagreement with Apple, and had to remove its "quick launch" feature that let users go straight into a game. Shadow had to remove that to become more like a "generic mirror" of a gaming computer to be approved, they said.
 Microsoft says it is still committed to finding a way to bring its streaming service to Apple devices, despite there being no clear way to do so for now.
