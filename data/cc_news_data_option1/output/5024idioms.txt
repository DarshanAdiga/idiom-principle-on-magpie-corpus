At any rate, at least some experts argue, 99 percent of people who contract the virus are in no danger of death, and those who are, the elderly and those with underlying conditions, can be addressed as a special class needing special help and protection as others rebuild our economy. Schools are safe if opened correctly, and the information on how to do it is readily available. Keeping children out of schools can be a disaster for them, a rip in their education that may never be totally repaired. Digital instruction is simply not available for everyone and nowhere close to the efficacy of person-to- person instruction.
 Scientists debate some of this, but we have been a free society, although yes, in emergencies we expect the government to intervene more than usual. It does not follow that anything goes or that overreach will be successful. An American instinct is for people to decide certain matters for themselves. It is actually more than an instinct, but a conviction that we have our rights. I do not hereby offer my respect to people who are careless, but neither do I believe Thanksgiving celebration is a matter of law enforcement with no implications for the future.

Mount St. Mary’s women’s basketball used a complete effort to take the program’s fifth straight home opener, defeating the UMBC Retrievers 72-58 at Knott Arena Saturday.
 “Our girls really locked in.” Head Coach Maria Marchesano said. “We switched some things up as the game went on and they were able to make those adjustments. We had a couple different game plans because we didn’t know exactly what [UMBC] was going to do, and sure enough they did exactly what we didn’t think they were going to do. We had to be to adjust on the fly and the girls did a really good job of that.”
 After struggling on offense against James Madison and defensively against Howard, the Mountaineers (1-2) put both parts of the game together against the Retrievers. They shot 52.7 percent from the floor, making 29 buckets in 59 attempts. The defense held UMBC (0-2) to 37.1 percent from the floor in the wire-to-wire finish.

But senators involved in the talks said the checks won’t be included as part of the compromise, even as Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and others said that could cause them to oppose the measure.
 Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat, indicated that excluding the checks while assuring small-business aid and renters’ assistance was the only way to reach agreement with Republicans who are putting firm limits on the bill’s final price tag.
 “The $1,200 check, it cost we believe nationally $300 billion to give you an idea,” he said. “The Democrats have always wanted a larger number, but we were told we couldn’t get anything through the Republicans, except this $900 billion level.”
 The plan being worked on by a group of Republican and Democratic senators is less than half of the Democrats’ push of $2.2 trillion and nearly double the $500 billion “targeted” package proposed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.
 Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., agreed that a new round of direct checks “may be a go” at some point. “This is not a stimulus bill, it’s a relief bill,” he said. “And it’s something for the next three to four months to help those in greatest need.”
 Both he and Durbin said that McConnell has shown interest in the bipartisan effort, and Cassidy said he was hopeful that President Donald Trump would embrace it as well.
 The proposal is expected to include about $300 per week in bonus federal unemployment payments, providing relief just as emergency aid payments at regular benefit levels are set to expire at year’s end. It would extend a freeze on evictions for people who cannot pay their rent and reauthorize the Paycheck Protection Program to give a second round of subsidies to businesses struggling through the pandemic.

BRUSSELS (AP) — One of the most intense days in the long-running Brexit trade negotiations produced few signs of progress and gloomy forecasts Monday, with the United Kingdom and the European Union seemingly still stuck on the same issues that have dogged the standoff for months. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier had no news of a breakthrough when be briefed ambassadors of the 27 member states on the chances of a deal with London before the Dec. 31 deadline. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said Barnier’s message was “very downbeat.” “I would say he is very gloomy, and obviously very cautious about the ability to make progress today,” Coveney told Irish broadcaster RTE. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen are due to speak by phone at 1600 GMT (11 a.m. EST) Monday for the second time in 48 hours, to decide whether to pull the plug on talks — a decision that could cost hundreds of thousands of jobs on both sides and disrupt cross-Channel trade for years to come. One official from an EU nation said “the difficulties persist\" over the legal oversight of any trade deal and standards of fair play that the U.K. needs to meet to be able to export in the EU. On fisheries too, a lot of work remains, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks were ongoing. Britain's pound currency fell more than 1% against the dollar to under $1.33 amid the uncertainty. Johnson's spokesman, Jamie Davies, declined to offer odds on a deal being struck. “I’m not going to put a percentage on it,\" he said. “We are prepared to negotiate for as long as we have time available if we think an agreement is still possible.” While the U.K. left the EU politically on Jan. 31, it remains within the...

“I would say he is very gloomy, and obviously very cautious about the ability to make progress today,” Coveney told Irish broadcaster RTE.
 British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen are due to speak by phone Monday evening for the second time in barely 48 hours, to decide whether to pull the plug on talks — a decision that could cost hundreds of thousands of jobs on both sides and disrupt cross-Channel trade for years to come.
 One official from an EU nation said “the difficulties persist" over the legal oversight of any trade deal and standards of fair play that the U.K. needs to meet to be able to export in the EU. On fisheries too, a lot of work remains, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks were ongoing.
 U.K. Foreign Office Minister James Cleverly acknowledged the situation had changed little despite the need for speed.
 “Yes, time is tight. Yes, it might go right to the wire and, indeed, it may well be that we don’t get the deal. But I think a deal is possible and we’ll keep working towards it,” he said.
 While the U.K. left the EU politically on Jan. 31, it remains within the bloc’s tariff-free single market and customs union through Dec. 31. Reaching a trade deal by then would ensure there are no tariffs and trade quotas on goods exported or imported by the two sides, although there would still be new costs and red tape.
 At his early morning meeting with EU ambassadors, Barnier faced some anxious member states that feared too much might have been yielded already to London. If talks continue after Monday, they will be closing in on an two-day EU summit starting Thursday, where German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron will be major players.

JOHANNESBURG - England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and Cricket South Africa (CSA) have agreed to postpone the remaining matches in the current men’s One Day International (ODI) Series.
 This news comes after two unnamed members of the England party tested positive for COVID-19 over the weekend, resulting in the cancellation of the first delay ODI, on Sunday, as well as the calling off the second game on Monday.
 The players continue to self-isolate in their rooms at the Vineyard Hotel in Cape Town.
 The decision to call off the remainder of the series was according to both parties, “taken jointly by the two boards to ensure the mental and physical health and welfare of players from both teams”.
 Both boards are now working together to determine when the three-match series can take place in the future with England due to return home on Thursday.
 CSA acting CEO Kugandrie Govender said of the developments: “The concern over the mental health impact of recent events on all involved is not one that we as CSA or the ECB take lightly, and the decision to postpone the tour is the most responsible and reasonable course of action for us.
 "I would like to thank the ECB for the continued positive relations, and we look forward to hosting the England men’s team in the near future,” said Govender.
 "We have always maintained that the welfare of our players and management is paramount,” Tom Harrison, ECB CEO, added.
 “We were concerned about the potential impact that recent developments might have on the wellbeing of the touring party, and so after consultation with Cricket South Africa, we have jointly made the decision to postpone the remaining matches in this series, in the best interest of the players’ welfare.
 “I would like to thank Cricket South Africa for their support and understanding on this matter and look forward to working with them to identify a time when we can return to play these fixtures in the future.”.

A big part of the world's electricity decarbonization challenge lies in expanding transmission capacity for wind and solar power -- and according to energy experts, Europe and the U.S. are falling behind on that task. Solving this problem will require a lot of new transmission on land and at sea. But using existing grid infrastructure more efficiently could help as well.
 That's what dynamic line rating technologies do, by measuring high-voltage transmission line capacity in real-time, as opposed to relying on static measurements. Using DLR could reduce costly grid congestion and speed interconnection of renewables, according to a decade of pilot projects and studies.
 "The move to an electrified, renewable-powered future is going to put more demand on the grid," Hudson Gilmer, CEO of DLR provider LineVision, told GTM. "We just can't build fast enough using the old approach."
 But knowing this isn't enough, he said. Utilities and grid operators must integrate this kind of data into grid operations and markets to make it effective, and regulatory structures that reward grid investments need to change to incentivize more efficient operations as well.  
 ## A decade of DLR proving points, technology development
 The value of DLR is well established. Belgian grid operator Elia has been testing it since 2008, and results indicate the 5 to 20 percent increase in ratings it can discover can improve market dispatch cost-effectiveness and increase integration and reduce curtailment of solar and wind power, according to a 2020 report from International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
 U.S. Department of Energy tests over the past decade have found similar results, according to a 2019 report to Congress. Texas utility Oncor and the New York Power Authority found average real-time transmission capacity at least 30 percent greater than static ratings, and sometimes much higher, according to analysis from Rob Gramlich, founder and president of research group Grid Strategies. Improvements like these could slash U.S. transmission grid congestion costs, which the group estimates have risen from $6.2 billion in 2016 to $8.3 billion in 2018.
 DLR could be particularly valuable for wind power, which makes up much of the variable generation that's being curtailed in wind-rich parts of the U.S. grid. That's because temperature is the main variable for power line capacity, and wind speed is a primary determinant of temperature. In other words, the same variable that increases wind power generation capacity can also boost the capacity of power lines carrying it to market, Gramlich noted.

“I’m happy he’s successful. He took a lot of criticism — well, we took a lot of criticism ... and give him all the credit,” Brooks said at the time. “He worked his butt off to be the player he is, and he deserves what he’s getting right now.”
 Four years later, stunning numbers and an inextinguishable competitive fire remain Westbrook’s calling cards. When the Wizards traded John Wall and a future first-round pick to the Houston Rockets for Westbrook on Wednesday night, there were several questions worth asking about the deal, including the nine-time all-star’s fit on a Bradley Beal-led team and the trade’s potential long-term benefits for a young Washington roster.
 But the Wizards at least can be sure that they acquired one of the league’s fiercest — and most consistently fierce — competitors. They are receiving a known quantity in exchange for a point guard who hasn’t played an NBA game in nearly two years. For a team that just a few weeks ago thought that it would be trying to work its way into the playoff conversation with a point guard who might be on a minutes restriction, Westbrook’s arrival changes a lot.
 At 32, he has shown no signs that his drive is waning. Westbrook averaged 27.2 points, 7.9 rebounds and seven assists this past season for Houston playing alongside James Harden, who is not exactly known for his generosity with the ball.
 He also shot a career-best 47.2 percent from the field, good enough to warrant his ninth all-NBA nod, tying him with Durant and Chris Paul. Among active players, only LeBron James has more, with 16. The California native averaged a triple-double during his MVP season in 2016-17, a feat that last had been done by Oscar Robertson in 1961-62. Westbrook then did it again the next two seasons.
 While it’s difficult to argue with those pure numbers on paper, the biggest short-term question for the Wizards is probably about Westbrook’s fit.
 Two rival Eastern Conference executives, both of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter freely, praised Washington’s gamble in interviews Thursday.

Still, potential sticking points remain.
 Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said last week they wouldn’t support the $908 billion proposal if it did not include checks for families, and were joined by Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are also against shielding businesses from lawsuits claiming negligence for COVID-19 outbreaks, a provision pushed by Republicans.
 While favoring the $1,200 checks, Biden said the emerging compromise was "immediately needed” and that additional assistance could follow later.
 On Sunday, lawmakers involved in the negotiations said the direct payments would have to wait until after Biden is inaugurated on Jan. 20. At that time, Biden will face a new Congress as vaccines are being distributed, with a narrowed Democratic majority in the House and a closely divided Senate potentially split 50-50 if Democrats are able to prevail in two runoff elections in Georgia on Jan. 5.
 Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said Sanders was not involved in the negotiations and "his characterization is just not accurate” about the potential liability protections for businesses. The direct payments, he said, will be a task for Biden.
 Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said the bipartisan group was focused on extending the most urgent aid for the next four months.
 “Every indication says more money is needed; we see that,” he said. “This gets us through basically the lifelines that people need and the small businesses that can survive and not go under.”
 Manchin said Biden's team, when in power, "can put together a different proposal that takes us further down the road for more recovery.”
 Durbin spoke on ABC’s “This Week,” Cassidy appeared on “Fox News Sunday,” Warner was on CNN’s “State of the Union” and Manchin was interviewed on NBC’s “Meet the Press.

“Washington improved because they have someone that can functionally play in the games and the head coach has deep familiarity with the player acquired. Totally worth the risk. The bigger risk was returning someone from a dramatic injury that so heavily relied on speed to be effective,” one executive said.
 The executive also said Westbrook could help bring along Washington’s young players such as Rui Hachimura and Deni Avdija simply by raising standards of competition across the board.
 “He may advance their development. Washington had to make the choice about playing those guys just to play them or playing them in games where winning and losing mattered. Now every game is going to be important because he will make it important. They might find out more about them this year than they anticipated.”
 The other executive liked the move for the Wizards simply based on the recent history of Westbrook’s new team.
 “I like [Westbrook] more in Washington than in Houston because the expectations will be lower,” the executive said.
 Still, Westbrook’s relationship with Beal is probably paramount to his effect on the Wizards’ younger players, especially as Beal decides whether he wants to stay in Washington long term. Beal took over as the Wizards’ leader on and off the court while Wall was injured for the past two years, and Westbrook is no shrinking violet.
 But Beal at least may have some familiarity with his playing style. On the court, Westbrook isn’t molded so differently from Wall. Both excel at playing downhill and driving to the rim and are devastatingly quick in transition. Neither is a strong shooter from long distance. Both have the ability to modulate speed and change direction on a dime, adding an explosive quality to whatever offense they’re in.
 The Wizards want to play fast on offense, and Westbrook should be able to help them push pace. Westbrook also will help lighten the scoring load for Beal at least as much as Wall would have.
 And Brooks, thanks to his Oklahoma City days, has experience with that particular balancing act. He is used to making two assertive players mesh.
 “I don’t think it’s a perfect fit, but I think it’s a better fit than Wall for Beal, based on [Westbrook’s] durability, consistency and hard play,” one longtime Eastern Conference assistant coach said. “Washington got the better end of the deal.”

But this Christmas is not the same. It is a pandemic Christmas where death is already setting new records. Nearly 2,900 lives were lost in a single day last week, roughly equivalent to a 9/11 every 24 hours. The CDC says COVID-19 may have claimed nearly 330,000 of us by Dec. 26th. Health care workers are physically and emotionally spent; the system is cracking under the strain.
 And so this is Christmas.
 But what is Christmas when you can’t — or at least, shouldn’t — travel? To go over the river and through the woods to grandma’s house this year is to risk exposing her to a deadly virus. Yet any year that denies you the ability to go home, to gather in a place of memory with those you love, is a year that steals something irreplaceable. That’s why carols written during World War II brim with such palpable yearning.
 “I’ll be home for Christmas, if only in my dreams...”
 “Next year, all our troubles will be out of sight...”
