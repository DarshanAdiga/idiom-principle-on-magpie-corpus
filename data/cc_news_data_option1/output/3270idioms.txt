Kenta Maeda's no-hit bid turned into a tough luck no decision Tuesday night. The Minnesota Twins right-hander was three outs away from the first no-hitter of the abbreviated 2020 MLB season when Milwaukee Brewers infielder Eric Sogard poked a soft line drive single to shallow center. The Brewers then rallied against Twins closer Taylor Rogers to erase a 3-0 deficit.
 Here is the Sogard single that ended Maeda's attempt at history:
 Once Maeda was out of the game, Rogers allowed a double and a walk to load the bases with no outs. Keston Hiura brought home Sogard with a single, then the Brewers tied the game when second baseman Ildemaro Vargas threw a ball away on a double play pivot. One run would have scored on the play, but the poor throw allowed Christian Yelich to scamper home and score the tying run.
 The Twins failed to score in the bottom of the 9th inning, thus invoking the extra innings tiebreaker rule. Neither team was able to push across the automatic runner at second base in the 10th and 11th innings. The Twins finally broke through and won the game on Jorge Polanco's walk-off fielder's choice in the 12th. Maeda couldn't finish the no-hitter and was stuck with a no decision, but his team managed to win the game (MIN 4, MIL 3 in 12 innings).

Japan’s exports in July plunged 19.2% from a year ago, as the coronavirus pandemic continued to slam the world’s third largest economy, government data showed Wednesday. The Finance Ministry’s provisional numbers showed Japan’s imports fell 22.3% in July. Exports to the U.S. especially suffered, declining 19.5% last month, as exports fell in plastic goods, iron and steel and computer parts. But Japan recorded its first trade surplus in four months on the back of a recovery in China.

 \- The hacked-off mother -
 Seeing news reports about oligarchs' luxury villas brought home to 50-year-old Vera Ivanova how wide the gulf was between their life and her own.
 The mother of a 25-year-old disabled son, Vera has been in the streets demanding the removal of an elite she says has "stolen" her life.
 The 420 leva (211 euros) that the two of them receive per month are "just enough to make ends meet", she sighs.
 She says she can't afford the renovations to her house needed to accommodate her son, who has cerebral palsy.
 "Mothers are hostages and don't have any choice but to leave work" in order to care for their children, says Ivanova, sporting a black T-shirt with the name of the NGO she co-founded with other mothers: "The System Is Killing Us."
 The health and social care systems are in urgent need of reform and "corrupt to the core," she says.

 Georgiev blames entrenched corruption.
 "We have to get rid of this mafia and create a civil society which will be more vigilant towards the next leaders," he tells AFP on Sofia's iconic Eagles' Bridge, the focal point for many of the protests.
 He has become part of a group of protesters who will brook no compromise with Borisov's government.
 They comprise NGO workers, lawyers, IT experts and others who have created a space to exchange ideas which they compare to the famous Speakers' Corner in London's Hyde Park.

The negotiations for seats would heighten tensions between Umno and its splinter party, they told FMT.
 Azmi noted that the two parties were vying for support from the same demographic and said there would have to be a lot of give and take in MN if it were to succeed in taking PPBM on board.
 “I think the respective leaderships can resolve this, but I’m not sure about the grassroots,” he added.
 In order to persuade the grassroots to accept PPBM’s membership of MN, he said, Umno leaders must demonstrate their party’s dominance.
 He said the easiest way to do this would be to ensure that the seat negotiations end with Umno contesting for all the seats currently held by former party members who have deserted the party.
 “Ill feelings against MPs who have abandoned Umno run high,” Azmi said. “As I see it, it’s going to be very difficult for these ex-Umno MPs to defend their seats under the PPBM ticket.”
 However, he expects an exception to be made for MPs such as Larut’s Hamzah Zainudin, Jeli’s Mustapa Mohamed and Masjid Tanah’s Mas Ermieyati Samsudin, whom he sees as likely winners in the election.
 “But there are a number of ex-Umno MPs who are dispensable,” he said.
 Yesterday, Umno deputy president Mohamad Hasan said he had received “a lot of feedback from the grassroots” indicating disagreement with the idea of accepting PPBM’s membership of MN.
 Umno president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi later said in a tweet that the views of the Umno grassroots would be taken into account before any decision is made.
 “The Umno Supreme Council will decide on this,” he said.
 Chin said the ideal situation for the Umno grassroots would be for PPBM to be dissolved and for its members to be absorbed into Umno.
 He said the grassroots were powerless but acknowledged that their disdain of PPBM could be strong enough to cause open conflict when it comes time for seat negotiations.
 “Right now it’s like shadow-boxing,” he said. “The real tensions will come when a general election is called and they are forced to negotiate for seats.”
 Chin said it was unlikely for Umno to compete for all the seats it contested in 2018 since a principle of seat negotiations is to allow an incumbent to vie for his seat again.
 It would also be unlikely for PPBM to contest in more than 50 constituencies, he added.
 He predicted that Umno and PAS would contest in most of the Malay-majority areas.
 “PPBM will get a minority of the Malay seats. It will probably end up clashing mostly with PKR in the mixed seats.”
 Barisan Nasional secretary-general Annuar Musa recently said MN had agreed in principle to PPBM’s wish to join the alliance and that an official invitation to the party was expected to be sent.

New Zealand appeared to be gaining control over a coronavirus outbreak in Auckland after just five new community infections were reported Wednesday amid record levels of testing and contact tracing. A sixth infection was found in a quarantined traveler who had returned from Qatar. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said 500 more military personnel would be deployed to quarantine hotels as the nation looks to reduce the number of private security guards it employs and tighten its border controls. Health authorities have still not figured out how the outbreak began after the country went 102 days without the virus spreading in the community. The discovery of the outbreak last week prompted authorities to put the nation’s largest city into a two-week lockdown.

In his article, he points to four stages that cemented Xi's statism-- the US- China trade war, the US attacks on Huawei, the Hong Kong protests, and the coronavirus pandemic. But the Chinese scholar is not sure how long Xi will remain in the saddle, despite the removal of term limits on his presidency in 2017. "Accepting Mao's lifetime rule taught the party and the people painful lessons, and that the highest leader would not rule for life is one of the most important shared convictions of the CPC high-level leadership, having become a powerful CPC tradition since the time of Deng Xiaoping. Even if other 'good' CPC traditions have been destroyed one after the other by Xi Jinping, this one cannot be lightly dismissed, and even someone like Xi Jinping cannot formally excise this clause from the written text even if in fact he winds up ruling for life," he observes.The growing friction with Washington has acquired dangerous proportions after two US aircraft carrier task forces were deployed in July at China's doorstep in the South China sea.

An Eritrean man goes on trial in Germany on Wednesday for fatally throwing a boy under a train during an episode of paranoid schizophrenia, in a case that stoked a heated immigration debate.
 The man, identified by police as Habte Araya, 41, is accused of pushing the eight-year-old boy and his mother onto the tracks in an apparently random attack at Frankfurt's main station last July.
 The mother was able to roll off the tracks to avoid the oncoming InterCity Express (ICE) train but the boy was killed instantly.
 The suspect, who had entered Germany from Switzerland days earlier, also tried to push a 78-year-old woman onto the tracks but she managed to save herself.
 The tragic case quickly filled the front pages of newspapers in Germany and led to an outpouring of sympathy, with 100,000 euros ($120,000) raised for the boy's family in just a few days.
 It also led the far-right AfD party to call for tighter controls on foreigners entering Germany, although the man was not in the country illegally.
 Following a psychiatric assessment, prosecutors said Araya was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and had "at least a considerably reduced ability" to control his actions.
 They say he committed manslaughter, attempted manslaughter and dangerous bodily injury and have applied for him to be placed in a secure psychiatric institution.
 He could also be found to have committed murder and attempted murder if he is deemed to have acted with malice and "deliberately exploited the victims' defencelessness".
 \- Father of three -
 Araya did not previously know the victims and showed no signs of alcohol or drug use at the time of the attack, prosecutors said.
 A married father of three, he had been living in Switzerland and was on the run from Swiss police after a violent incident the previous week.
 He had recently undergone psychiatric treatment, according to police in the Swiss canton of Zurich where he lived.
 The week before the incident in Frankfurt, he had threatened a neighbour with a knife and locked her up, and also trapped his wife and their children, aged one, three and four, in their flat before running away.
 Police said it appeared the suspect had not been listed as wanted in European police databases and had been able to cross borders freely.
 \- Tougher border controls -
 The case shocked Germany and led politicians to call for heightened security including more camera surveillance at train stations and tighter border checks.
 Conservative Interior Minister Horst Seehofer also saw the case as an occasion to take a tougher line on immigration, suggesting more extensive screening and "occasional temporary checks" at borders.
 A government spokesman said last week that plans for increased security in stations were still under review, but had been slowed down due to coronavirus restrictions.
 In a similar case just one month before the Frankfurt incident, a 34-year-old mother died after being pushed in front of a train, allegedly by a Serbian man.
 Germany's far right highlighted both killings to once more criticise what it regards as the flawed immigration policies of Chancellor Angela Merkel's government.
 "Protect the citizens of our country at long last," the anti-migration AfD party's parliamentary group leader Alice Weidel tweeted.
 Araya had been living in Switzerland since 2006 and was granted asylum in 2008.
 According to the Bild newspaper, he had worked for a local transport company and was described by authorities as "an example of successful integration".
 He was even featured in a campaign by Swiss authorities to promote successful integration.
