While it’s a fact that the tech industry has a long way to go on this front, what is good is that we’re seeing women continue to beat the drum and to implement change. Having more women in the room will empower more and more to do the same. And in reality, diversity — gender and otherwise — should be a priority for every single leader and every single company no matter what industry — not just tech. This topic’s momentum and the tech community’s attention to it over the past few years gives me hope that we are moving in the right direction. Conversations and columns like these are so important in creating a sense of community and urgency among women working to break down the barriers that remain.

In addition to Astley’s treatise, 1584 also saw the publication of Thomas Bedingfield’s _Art of Riding_, a translation, abridgment, and adaptation of Claudio Corte’s important treatise, _Il cavallerizzo_ _di Claudio Corte_ (1562). An influential and cosmopolitan Neapolitan master, Corte resided in the English court in the 1570s and deeply impressed its leading horsemen.[xvii] Blundeville, for example, praised Corte as a “most excellent Rider,” and “well learned, wise, courteous, and modest,” and Astley, invoked him (together with Grisone) when discussing how best to turn a horse (Astley, 58).[xviii] Bedingfield most likely knew Corte both indirectly through the latter’s writing and directly through his teaching, so he obliged when the Gentleman Pensioner Henry Macwilliams entreated him “to afford his paines in the reducing of these few precepts, gathered out of a larger volume written by Claudio Corte, into our English toong.”[xix]

I think normalizing the experience of women as mothers and caretakers in the STEM and Tech industries still remains an enormous challenge. From my own experience, one of the first moments I became conscious about being a “woman” in the workplace was when I was 8 months pregnant. At that time, there were around 12 of us working from and sleeping in a studio-apartment “office” in Spain trying to get our vision off the ground. It was a make-or-break time for the company, and every moment of work contributed by everyone in that room mattered to the potential success of Booking.com. It was difficult because I sensed them wondering what would happen when I was on maternity leave, or if I was even going to come back after the baby. It wasn’t something men had to think about. At the end of the day, the company was supportive, but it was definitely a moment where I noticed that being a woman in the workplace meant slightly different circumstances at times. It’s been 15 years since that experience, but I have heard countless stories of women across the STEM and Tech industries that continue to face down these dynamics.

The model’s fault database has been updated based on GA’s updated 2018 fault model and expanded to 391 faults, including a recent fault discovered as a result of the 2018 Lake Muir Earthquake. The latest ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) are included to better capture the epistemic uncertainty inherent in estimating ground motions in tectonically stable regions. Updated Site Soil Classification Maps offer higher resolution amplification modeling along the coastal areas where the majority of the population resides. The vulnerability framework now uses intensity-based damage functions and has been expanded to include explicit support for new risk types including marine hull, marine cargo, and builder’s risk.
 “The updated model’s revised view of the seismic hazard and updated vulnerability functions provide a better match to historical losses. These updates allow for AIR to continue to provide a comprehensive and scientifically credible earthquake model for Australia,” noted Dr. Guin.
 As a supplement to this model, AIR is releasing nine Extreme Disaster Scenarios (EDS). EDS’ are meant to provide clients with additional scenarios in light of the uncertainty, to assist in stress testing and assessing the impact of large loss events. While they represent low probability—and in some cases very low probability—scenarios, they are nevertheless scientifically plausible.

Even during my time as a naval officer in the Canadian navy, I had a small business on the side. With my physics and engineering background, moving into tech companies after I left the navy was a natural next step. I initiated my first tech start-up in 1995 in Ottawa, Canada — Dynex Power Inc. We listed in 1998 and acquired the GEC Plessey site in Lincoln, UK, in 2000. I was then involved in relaunching and developing the brand strategy for Plessey, ran the commercial team — generating more than £200 million in sales — developed the GaN platform strategy, raised nearly £100 million for the company and successfully exited in December 2018. Early in 2019 I joined Sorex Sensors — a sensor technology spin-out from the University of Cambridge — as CEO to spearhead the company’s next phase of growth.

The Government&rsquo;s roadmap for opening schools is to be unveiled later today and one of the areas which has raised most concern among unions is teaching numbers.A total of 1,080 staff will be brought in - including 120 guidance counsellors to &ldquo;support student well-being&rdquo; - to address potential staff shortages.The Irish National Teachers Organisation (INTO) had called for certainty around how teacher absences will be managed as any teachers who have any symptoms of respiratory infection have been asked not to attend school in line with public health advice.It sought assurance that supply panels of teachers will be established around the country to allow substitute teachers to be deployed at short notice.INTO General Secretary John Boyle welcomed the &ldquo;detailed plan&rdquo; but also warned that the €350 million could run out very early on and said it must be reviewed at the end of September. &ldquo;It is ironic that it has taken a pandemic for us to realise that education cannot work on a shoestring,&rdquo; he told RTÉ&rsquo;s Morning Ireland.He said the plan will put significant pressure on principals and boards of management, describing it as a &ldquo;a big ask&rdquo;. Meanwhile, a senior union source said primary school children will be asked to maintain a distance of one metre.However, the plan also acknowledges that this will be difficult to implement among the infant classes indoors and therefore physical distance measures will not apply to them.Taoiseach Micheál Martin, Education Minister Norma Foley and Minister of State Josepha Madigan TD, launch the roadmap for reopening schools, subject to Cabinet approval, at around 5.30pm today.

 She was forced to sleep with 10 to 15 men a day, sometimes making up to £1,000 a day, which was immediately taken away from her by her captors.
 The woman was regularly beaten and abused by the two men, once with a stick on the back of her legs.
 She was never allowed to leave the house on her own and always had someone with her, police said.
 Two Romanian officers, who are seconded to the UK to help with international affairs with Romania, were instrumental in helping detectives once the woman contacted her family without her captors knowledge.
 They and a team of officers were immediately deployed to the house in Plumstead and both men were arrested for offences under the Modern Slavery Act, controlling prostitution and actual bodily harm.

Hard work, dedication, and stress management are crucial. Focus on the essential things that create real revenue, and avoid menial tasks that are often nerve-racking and exhausting. Your mental and physical health are the keys to success. Andrew is very much into healthy habits, including proper sleep hours, diet, and training. No success comes overnight or as a result of burnout. Great things take time and require patience. “There is no use in having all the money in the world if you are not happy and healthy,” he insists. So make sure that you are working on things that are meaningful and pleasant. There will be tough times too, and in these cases, a positive mindset is life-saving. It is often a lonely journey since you are the person in charge of your next moves. Yet, it would help if you always remembered the reasons why you started in the first place and all the benefits that come with running your business, including flexibility and freedom. If it were easy to achieve, everyone would be doing it. Still, both the result and the entire journey are really worth the effort. The greatest bet is to create a sustainable model of success that will stand the test of time. Putting off short term goals will allow you to focus on much more rewarding long-term strategies. Minor setbacks, like losing a client, should not hold you back; there will always be another chance for you.

 I’ll leave it to others to express shock, since this is not the first or second, but at least the third such incident to unfold recently along this block where pedestrians of all sorts congregate and travel daily.
 The second scare was on a Sunday morning last year, when a horse bolted down Laurens Street after becoming spooked while passing a neighbor cleaning garden furniture. After quite the commotion, the driver was finally able to halt the cart near Anson Street.

The sale of the asset was completed according to a capitalisation strategy approved by the creditors to RAFO Onesti as part of the insolvency procedure, with the aim of developing the largest logistics centre in Moldavia.      Roserv Oil is a newly established company that will focus on the development of nationwide logistics terminals for both containers and warehouses for petroleum products.      The company decided to buy the assets of the bankrupt RAFO Onesti platform, with the aim of developing the largest logistics centre for containers and petroleum products that will serve the region of Moldavia. This specialty complements the main activity of the Grampet Group, which is rail freight. With the takeover by Roserv Oil, the assets of RAFO Onesti become productive assets, part of the business of the Grampet Group, owned by businessman Gruia Stoica.      With the takeover by Roserv Oil, the platform could generate, in the long run, at least 600 jobs, and the first phase of the project involving the traded assets will generate over 200 jobs. In the near future, Roserv Oil will begin a process to evaluate existing facilities.      The company aims to attract partners from companies specialising in the production of raw materials and to put into operation several facilities available on the platform.      Throughout the insolvency period, the RAFO Onesti platform was kept in a state of conservation by CITR and was intensely promoted.      Over the last three years, CITR has offered for sale the RAFO platform, carrying out over 10 capitalisation procedures. The RAFO platform was promoted both in Romania and internationally, and there were over 100 direct contacts for the asset.      Although there has been an apparent interest in the asset, unfortunately the refinery has not been operational for more than 10 years; it has not get investment in modernising its technologies to measure up to its competitors and meet market demand, as the relatively low production capacity and high resumption costs have made this capitalisation procedure very difficult.      The transaction unlocks the long-term inactivity of the platform while paving the way for the development of a business activity on the RAFO Onesti platform.      CITR, an Impetum Group company, has managed, through its solutions of 20 years in restructuring and insolvency, almost 1,000 projects and is currently managing assets valued at over one billion euros.

Bharti Infratel on Monday reported a 21 per cent decline in its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended June at Rs 704 crore. Its consolidated revenues dropped 6 per cent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 3,505 crore, while consolidated EBITDA dropped 7 per cent YoY to Rs 1,807 crore. “It is a matter of satisfaction for all of us at Indus and Infratel to rise to the occasion in providing vital connectivity which has kept the country connected and businesses continuing despite a very large number of people working from home,” said Akhil Gupta, Chairman, Bharti Infratel. “The resilience shown by telecom industry as a vital service even in the wake of extreme exigencies like Covid-19 bears well for the future potential of our infrastructure industry. We remain fully prepared in maintaining and strengthening our leadership position going forward,” he added. The company’s operating free cash flows came in at Rs 1,267 crore, up 5 per cent on a YoY basis. The company also declared an interim dividend of Rs 2.30 per equity share of Rs 10 each for the financial year 2020-21. The return on equity (RoE) pre-tax and post-tax increased to 29.9 per cent and 23.8 per cent as against 33.6 per cent and 26.9 per cent respectively on YoY basis. The return on capital employed pre-tax was 23.8 per cent against 26.1 per cent respectively on YoY basis. The company pointed that the telecom industry is among the businesses that are less impacted due to Covid-19. “Thus the company believes that thus far, there is no significant impact of Covid-19 pandemic on the financial position and performance of the company. While rollouts were impacted partly in the quarter due to nationwide lockdowns, we are now running its business and operations without any major disruptions,” the company said. As of June 30, Bharti Infratel owned and operated 42,339 towers with 75,435 co-locations in 11 telecommunication circles while Indus operated 1,27,291 towers with 2,35,192 co-locations in 15 telecommunication circles.

A month later, however, and Newcastle fans are still in the dark over the status of the deal, with the Premier League refusing to comment when asked by local outlet the Chronicle this weekend.
 The latest reports from the Middle East continue to signal that the Saudis have confidence that the deal will eventually be given the green light, although the growing fear is that that club will need to begin the next Premier League season, set to start in mid-September, under current owner Mike Ashley.
 That would make life difficult for manager Bruce in terms of recruitment as he operates with an uncertain budget and indeed an uncertain future over his own role given the widespread belief that the new owners would look to bring in a bigger name to the St. James' Park dugout, despite Bruce guiding the team to a 13th-place finish.
 To complicate matters, should the Saudi deal fail, there is a reported bid from American tycoon Henry Mauriss waiting in the wings.
