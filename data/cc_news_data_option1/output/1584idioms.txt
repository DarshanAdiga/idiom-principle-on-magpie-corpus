The  _Big Little Lies_ star is so invested in sustainable living solutions, she makes her own toothpaste--just one of the eco-friendly concoctions in her medicine cabinet. After joining Greenpeace for a sea expedition to learn more about the threats facing our oceans, she teamed with American Express in 2019 on an initiative to help protect the water.
 "At the end of the day, corporations have the power to drive insane amounts of consumer change, and consumers have the power to drive corporate change," Woodley told _Architectural Digest_. "American Express was witnessing that ocean conservation was an important topic to a lot of its consumers. And not only did they change their corporate policies to include the reduction of single-use plastic and become carbon neutral, but also by creating a campaign where consumers can directly be a part of an initiative to clean up shorelines."
 "We come from this planet," she continued, "and we go back to this planet when we're gone. And I think it's important to reintegrate that truth into our daily realities and our daily lifestyles. And it doesn't mean that we all need to be living in the woods or collecting our own spring water. But it does mean there's a responsibility to future generations to take care of this planet and to make sure that this planet exists in a sustainable way for them in the way that it has sustained life for us."

England bowler Chris Woakes says cricketers would agree to be quarantined together in one location if it means they will be allowed to play matches after the COVID-19 pandemic suspended the season.
 The England and Wales Cricket Board has said the season will not start before May 28 and British media reported players could be asked to stay at hotels near grounds and play matches without spectators present.
 "If the players had to be put in quarantine for a period of time I think players would be happy to do so," Woakes was quoted as saying by the Telegraph.
 "If after this... cricket was allowed to come back again and it was at a venue where there was space for players on site, then I think players would be happy to do that but obviously it depends on how long it is to be for.
 "If it was going to be a three-four week window then I think guys would be open to being able to do that without too many issues."
 Woakes said they would only return if medical experts deem it safe to do so but that players would not be willing to stay away from their families for an extended period of time.
 "There are a lot of people with young families," he added. "I'm not sure how it would work... The guys have started to think about playing behind closed doors because it kind of looks like there is a high probability of that happening."
 England are due to host West Indies in a three-test series in June and play two limited-over series against Australia in July.
 The ECB will meet on Thursday to discuss whether the suspension will be extended beyond May 28.

 The Oscar winner and founder of the Sundance Film Festival is a longtime trustee with the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit founded in 1970 that boasts a staff of roughly 700 lawyers, scientists and policy advocates with a common cause--preserving our planet's natural resources, finding clean energy solutions and stopping those who are so inclined from plundering those resources.
 The environmental movement "came on strong in the late '60s and early '70s when young people were looking for change," Redford told _TIME_ in 2015. "A lot of that energy of young people was, 'well what can we work on?' But it wasn't enough. Then it faded away. And now it's coming back because the consequences are clear, the evidence has landed in people's back yards. Before people would say it is the Doomsday prophecy, you are trying to scare us. But we are beyond that now, because it's clear."

About 20 human service staff members are laid off, he said, noting that this will help to save the county money.
 There is a community helpline run through the Dickinson Center that Potter County residents can call if they need help with food or support of any kind during the pandemic: (814) 776-0205.
 Commissioner Barry Hayman said the commissioners have been talking about holding town hall meetings even before the pandemic arose. Hayman acknowledged that a telephone town hall, while “not ideal circumstances,” is the “new normal.”
 Potter County officials are keeping the public apprised of the ongoing changes at seven days a week, often multiple times a day, at pottercountypa.net, said Commissioner Paul Heimel. There are a number of online resources, too, including online county services.
 Heimel noted that Congress will vote on a successor to the CARES Act — the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act — and he is worried the county will lose $1.4 million in funding that was proposed for the county.
 Heimel talked about the seriousness of both the COVID-19 pandemic itself and the economic blow to local businesses.
 He “sees a false sense of security” from county residents due to the low number of confirmed cases that the state Department of Health reports. “Statistics can be very deceiving,” he said. “We are anything but out of the woods.”
 At the same time, Heimel is learning through a local business survey that a large number say they will never reopen.
 “That is a shocking development and a very deep concern,” he said. “They are our lifeblood,” he said of local businesses.
 Commissioners are asking that business owners go to the Potter County Community Development Facebook page to take the survey, as it will help them gather statistics that they can pass along to state legislators.

The Cyber & Jihad Lab monitors, tracks, translates, researches, and analyzes cyber jihad originating from the Middle East, Iran, South Asia, and North and West Africa. It innovates and experiments with possible solutions for stopping cyber jihad, advancing legislation and initiatives federally – including with Capitol Hill and attorneys-general – and on the state level, to draft and enforce measures that will serve as precedents for further action. It works with leaders in business, law enforcement, academia, and families of terror victims to craft and support efforts and solutions to combat cyber jihad, and recruits, and works with technology industry leaders to craft and support efforts and solutions.

In addition to the routine 911 and EMA activities, there are now daily reports on coronavirus news. He is working with agencies including the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency, regional task forces, local hospitals and officials from neighboring counties.
 “Our largest challenge so far was (obtaining) the PPE (personal protective equipment) needed,” Dunn said, explaining that PPE was needed for emergency medical responders, police, firefighters, human services, the county and the jail.
 Similarly, two representatives of UPMC explained they have looked through their inventory and have worked with several agencies and organizations to prepare for any influx of patients. They meet every day at 4 p.m. for an update.
 Among the preparations was working on the telehealth capabilities so patients don’t have to come in, as well as making sure there would be staff available. At UPMC Cole, they have set up tents outside to vet patients.
 UPMC has a plan to care for more patients if there is a surge, which can include expanding to buildings such as the wellness center, or even putting beds in other places in town such as the Gunzburger building or a local church.
 At Potter County CareerLink, employees have been working from home since March, said Mary Jo Stuckey. While they are not the agency that handles unemployment compensation, they have been directing people to whom they need to talk to, as well as working as a resource for employees and employers.
 Jim Kockler, director of Potter County Human Services, said they are still “up and running,” with only one program shut down — the senior centers — to ensure the “most vulnerable population remains safe.” They are still providing daily meals for senior center participants.
 Most staff members are working from home, with the exception of directors and supervisors, and staff can be reached by phone, Kockler explained. Staff members are calling consumers at least twice a week to check on them and still addressing any crises.

A regular at the annual People's Climate March and producer of multiple documentaries about environmental issues, the Oscar winner established his eponymous foundation back in 1998 to promote awareness and he's been active in causes allied in the fight against climate change ever since. Over the years DiCaprio has sat on the board of the World Wildlife Fund, Global Green USA, and the International Fund for Animal Welfare; was named UN Messenger of Peace on Climate Change in 2014; and he spoke at the United Nations in 2016 before the signing of the Paris Agreement to combat global warming. He even met with then-president-elect Trump to try to get his ear on the issue, but to no avail.
 In 2018 the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation announced $11 million in new grants pledged to the non-profit's six main programs--Wildlands Conservation, Oceans Conservation, Climate Change, Indigenous Rights, Transforming California, and Innovative Solutions--bringing the organization's total financial impact to over $100 million. And in 2019 the foundation became part of Earth Alliance, a super-organization co-chaired by DiCaprio that pools the resources of several funds to further the fight against climate change and attacks on biodiversity.
  _And_ , he was one of the first big movie stars you saw driving a Prius.
 "I am consumed by this," DiCaprio told _Rolling Stone _in 2016. "There isn't a couple of hours a day where I'm not thinking about it. It's this slow burn. It's not 'aliens invading our planet next week and we have to get up and fight to defend our country,' but it's this inevitable thing, and it's so terrifying."

 The tiny island state off the coast of China currently has less than 500 confirmed cases and deaths are in the single digits due to COVID-19, making it one of the best case scenarios in the world. Taiwan's coronavirus approach is one of the most aggressive in the world--early testing, months before a pandemic was declared, strict quarantining measures and most controversially, using data to track its citizens and suspected cases.
 Adrian Cheung talks to Nick Zarowny, a Canadian who's lived in Taiwan for 20 years, for a view of what life is like for many residents. That's followed by an interview with Dr. Jason Wang of Stanford University School of Medicine, who has published a paper on the aggressive approach Taiwan has taken--and whether we could take those same measures in Canada and around the world.

"Had I not been able to see him in the draft workout and sat down and talked with him and looked into his eyes, I don’t think I would have drafted him. So I think there is value in that. At the same time we drafted Avery Bradley without any draft workouts. We drafted Steve Nash back in our Phoenix days without a draft workout. So I think you don’t always get guys in for draft workouts, but you have to be prepared to take guys. That’s why we’re doing so much homework at this time and taking advantage of getting ahead of the game in case we don’t get draft workouts. But we’ll be prepared."
