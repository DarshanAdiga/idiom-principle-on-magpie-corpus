People in villages located near forest area in Anthiyur has urged the Forest Department to maintain the elephant-proof trenches properly so that wild animals do not enter their farm land.
 On Wednesday night, an elephant from Chennampatti Forest Range entered a farm land owned by Ponnusamy (45) and trampled him to death. Forest personnel and Vellithiruppur police arrived at the spot on Thursday and held inquiries. The villagers said that farm lands were located near the forest area and wild animals destroyed their crops frequently. They said that the elephant-proof trenches were not maintained properly and hence elephants entered their lands easily. They wanted the depth of the trenches increased and solar fencing installed so that the animals did not enter their lands.
 The villagers did not allow the police to send the body to Anthiyur Government Hospital for post-mortem. They demanded a compensation of ₹ 5 crore and a government job for a family member of the victim. Forest officials asked them to give their demands in writing. Later, they submitted a petition after which the body was sent to the hospital.

The Mass. Gaming Commission held an emergency meeting via conference call at 10 a.m. Saturday to discuss the \"operational status of gaming licensees in light of the coronavirus.\"


--DocBreak--
BOSTON -- Massachusetts gaming regulators and its licensees agreed to a two- week shutdown of the state's slots parlor and two resorts casinos Saturday and are working to finalize the plan as state government takes serious steps to try to staunch the spread of the coronavirus that's infected 123 people in the state.
 Gaming operations are expected to cease by late Saturday night and other operations at the casinos -- hotels, restaurants, clubs and retail shops -- would have to shut down by Sunday under the plan the commission authorized its staff to put into writing for final approval. Another meeting is expected to finalize the plan.
 Casino operators said they would need some time to ensure the closures are orderly and safe, and to re-book overnight guests at other hotels.
 The Mass. Gaming Commission held an emergency meeting via conference call at 10 a.m. Saturday to discuss the "operational status of gaming licensees in light of the coronavirus." Representatives from Plainridge Park Casino in Plainville, MGM Springfield and Encore Boston Harbor in Everett participated in the call and each business said it was fully on board with the commission's action.
 Commission staffers said discussions around the plan were collaborative with the casino companies and evolved over the last few weeks. Interim Executive Director Karen Wells said the licensees agreed to "an orderly closure from the commission."
 Brian Gullbrants, president of Encore Boston Harbor, said he thinks it is "prudent at this time to pause our operations." A representative of MGM Springfield said the company is "fully supportive of whatever your decision may be."
 The change will have economic impacts on the state's coffers, and the pocketbooks of the thousands of people who have found jobs in the relatively young Massachusetts gaming world. All three companies pledged during Saturday's meeting to pay its full-time employees during the two-week shutdown.
 The commission is due to publish February revenue figures on Monday, but the state can typically rely on about $21 million in monthly revenue from its three gambling halls.
 Commissioner Eileen O'Brien called the decision "the only prudent thing to do" given the public health emergency.
 "I agree that we need to be better safe than sorry," commissioner Enrique Zuniga said.
 The commission said its operations staff will coordinate with the casinos to figure out the fine details of the "orderly closure" and expects to hold another meeting this weekend to discuss those details.
 All three facilities said they expect to maintain a small team of staff -- management and security, mostly -- during the closures.
 Around the country, other states have shut down or limited casino operations as American society adjusts to social distancing in a public health emergency.
 Illinois on Friday suspended riverboat casino operations and Ohio ordered its gaming facilities to either close or keep the number of customers and workers present below 100.
 On Friday, Gov. Charlie Baker banned most gatherings of 250 people or more, the Catholic Church in Boston suspended Masses until further notice and many local school systems have canceled classes for at least a week. In Boston's case, schools will likely be closed until late April.
 Sporting events, concerts, theater performances and conferences have been called off. A massive chunk of the state's workforce is adjusting to working remotely and state agencies like the Gaming Commission are operating in uncharted waters.
 Saturday morning's unusual virtual emergency meeting was made possible by the fact that Baker last week suspended parts of the Open Meeting Law in an attempt to allow government to function without putting people in physical proximity of one another.
 The commission posted a public notice of the meeting - including the dial-in information for any member of the public who wanted to "attend" the meeting - around 11 p.m. Friday.

School districts throughout the area have now decided to close their doors for at least one to two weeks in the face of the continuing surge of the COVID-19 emergency.
 Milford was among the first on Friday to announce a two-week closure.
 Local area schools added to the list of closures now include Ashland, Bellingham, Framingham, Franklin, Holliston, Hopkinton, Hopedale, Medfield, Medway, Mendon-Upton, Millis, Natick, Tri-County Regional Vocational, as well as the Benjamin Franklin Classical Charter Public School in Franklin.
 School superintendents from around the state participated in a conference call Friday with the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) and the Department of Public Health to discuss the issue and hear guidelines.
 On Friday evening, the Tri-County Superintendents Roundtable - a professional association comprised of 25 school districts and special education collaboratives - issued a release announcing that its membership of local superintendents and executive directors coordinated to close all public schools in the region for one to two weeks "out of an abundance of caution in an effort to reduce the risk of COVID-19 to the school communities."
 The complete list of school districts and special education collaboratives that are members of the association include: ACCEPT Collaborative, Ashland, Dedham, Dover-Sherborn, Framingham, Franklin, Holliston, Hopkinton, King Philip Regional, Maynard, Medfield, Medway, Millis, Natick, Needham, Norfolk, Norfolk County Agricultural School, Plainville, Keefe Tech, The Education Cooperative, Tri-County, Walpole, Wellesley, Westwood and Wrentham.
 The Milford school system's social media accounts pushed out the message about its two-week closing early Friday afternoon. The buildings had already been closed Thursday through the weekend for extensive cleaning, after family of a staff member was connected to a Biogen conference in Boston. That conference has been linked to the majority of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state.
 School in the towns closing for two weeks are expected to reopen on March 30. Those closing for at least one week hope to reopen on March 23. But in all cases the school administrators said they will reassess whether longer closings will be necessary beyond their one- and two-week initial closings.
 A collaborative decision
 At a press conference Friday afternoon, Gov. Charlie Baker said the DESE and the DPH gave "detailed guidance to our public schools about how districts should respond to mitigate the spread (of) coronavirus."
 "That guidance gives schools very specific advice about when to close individual school schools and for how long," he said. "Public health officials do not recommend our school systems shut down system wide at this time. They recommend careful monitoring of students and temporary closures to allow for schools to clean and reopen."
 He left the decision up to individual school districts.
 In a statement released Friday evening, the Tri-County Superintendents Roundtable noted, "We believe the decision to close our schools is the best course of action in preventing the spread of the coronavirus and keeping our students and staff healthy and safe. Closing schools for at least one week will give school districts ample time to thoroughly clean and sanitize school buildings and district offices."      "We will continue to monitor this situation closely and will consult with each other and with local and state health officials, while following the guidelines of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Ultimately, decisions to close schools are not made lightly and each community and school district has to do what they think is best for the people in their communities."
 In Bellingham, Superintendent Peter Marano noted in an advisory posted on the school system's website that "our first priority is to keep students and staff safe. I will continue to monitor the situation; it is ever changing and I want to make sure we fully implement the guidance of our local health department, Department of Public Health and the Department of Education."
 He noted in an updated statement later Friday that Bellingham's two-week closure "is being done on a regional basis, as all of the superintendents in the Blackstone Valley have been in close consultation."
 "Potential infection does not discriminate among borders and we are all in agreement that a regional response is the most effective one," he stated.
 In Franklin, Superintendent Sara Ahern said in an email Friday evening that the choice was made to go with a two-week closing "to promote social distancing and out of concern of increasing absences of students and staff and worry within the community."
 "As a district, we continue to remain informed of the health advisories being issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Massachusetts Department of Public Health, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education and other agencies," she said earlier in the week.
 School buildings across the area have undergone deep cleaning efforts, which educators said will continue for the foreseeable future.
 "All of our buildings will be closed with the exception of custodians, who will be working to do a deep sanitizing of the facilities," Mendon-Upton Regional School District Superintendent Joseph Maruszczak said Friday, echoing the words of fellow administrators across the area.

 Volatility in other asset classes is also very elevated, especially in bonds and commodities and to a lesser extent in FX, they said, while a measure of cross asset volatility also hit extremes.
 Volatility-related selling by systematic traders was blamed by many market participants for last week’s turmoil. The Deutsche Bank analysts estimated that leveraged funds significantly cut exposure as portfolio volatility rose, reducing positions across the board from both the long and short side of the market regardless of underlying momentum signals.
 Cross-asset correlations flipped and even traditional safe havens, including gold and Treasurys, saw bouts of selling, putting additional pressure on equities in an environment where liquidity was already at record lows and raised stock-market volatility even further. What happens on the volatility front, meanwhile, will be crucial.
 “As we have noted previously, a moderation in volatility is an important precondition for investors to raise risk exposures,” the Deutsche Bank analysts wrote.

Dating back to even before Hurricane Katrina, Louisiana has gazed across the Atlantic for guidance from the Netherlands, an early adopter of large-scale interventions to prevent flooding.
 So it’s not really surprising that, with the conversation shifting from just keeping water out to also living with the water that gets in, the Dutch are once more ahead of the game. We may be talking about enlisting nature to help rebuild lost barriers and ecosystems along the coast, and capturing rather than draining rainwater in urban areas, but they’ve been talking about it longer and putting that talk into action.
 With the support of the Pulitzer Center’s Connected Coastlines reporting initiative, journalists from this paper and WWNO New Orleans Public Radio explored some of the Netherlands’ recent projects. They viewed green rooftops in Rotterdam, which not only create new gardens but cool buildings and keep water from flowing into drains (there are a few of these in New Orleans, including atop the Sewerage & Water Board’s headquarters). They visited the Sand Motor, a massive pile of sand that’s being transformed by the wind, waves and currents into 3,500 acres of new beach and dunes. They viewed retaining ponds that double as new recreation spots and urban green space. And they saw formerly developed areas returned to nature, part of the difficult process of strategic retreat.

And the main topic of the evening was where you had the best luck finding birds.
   
 But the main question today is, "Did you see any birds at all?"
   
 We've always had ups and downs in pheasant numbers. One year we had numerous severe hail storms, and it took a good year or so for the birds to come back. Severe droughts do the same thing to the population. Still, they always came back. But today, I guess I've been waiting long enough that I'm starting to wonder if something has changed.
   
 According to K-State Extension wildlife specialist Charlie Lee, it's not my imagination.
   
 "In 2018, there were 340,000 birds harvested in Kansas. That's about half of the long term 63-year average of 600,000," Lee said. "In the top year of 1982, Kansas pheasant hunters bagged 1.1 million birds."
   
 So what happened? Lee says a lot of people focus on winter survival and think winter food and cover are the causes.
   
 "But I think nesting and brood rearing habitats are more likely the limiting factors," he said. "In brief, we don't need to feed a bird in winter that didn't get born or survive until fall."
   
 Kansas State University entomologist Sarah Zukoff says the loss of habitat plays a big role in the decline of the pheasant population. But the problem is compounded by the fact this same loss of habitat is also affecting pollinators and other insects in the same dramatic way. So at the end of the day, if food plants, cover from predators and insect food sources are limited or are eliminated, it greatly affects pheasant numbers.
   
 So what is happening to habitat? Over the past 20 to 30 years, farming has changed a lot. Randy Rodgers, of Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks, says we started using more herbicides, we intensified crop rotations and we adopted use of higher yielding shorter wheat varieties.
   
 Rodgers says pheasants had been able to nest successfully in green wheat in the spring. Then broadleaf weed growth in the post-harvest wheat stubble provided pheasant chicks with an abundant supply of insects that are essential for the first two months of life. The weed canopy also provided protection from the elements and from predators. That protection carried them well into the next spring when they'd move back into the new wheat on nearby fields to start the cycle all over again.
   
 But today, we want no weed growth. We now grow grain sorghum or corn instead of fallow. Farming is an intensively competitive industry. And from the business point of view, you have no choice but to be as good as you can be. Good for the pocket book. Bad for the wildlife.
   
 Further, Brittany Smith, biologist with Pheasants Forever, says research shows weed-free wheat and sorghum stubble are least preferred nesting sites. They are at the very bottom of the list.
   
 "Chem fallow and a general decline in high quality nesting and brood cover have led to a sharp decline in bird numbers," Smith said. "In this highly intensive ag landscape, wetlands tend to be the last remaining refuges for wildlife."
   
 According to Mariah Ehmke, University of Wyoming ag economist, in the broader picture, loss of habitat is affecting more than pheasant and quail numbers. Citing data from Cornell University and Georgetown University, she says nearly a third of all wild birds in the U.S. and Canada have vanished since 1970. Especially hard hit is the bird populations in the grassland areas, including Kansas where more than half of our birds have disappeared.
   
 Outside of habitat loss and increasing temperatures, other contributors to the problem include increased use of pesticides as well as feral and domestic cats and collisions with buildings.
   
 Here in Kansas, the red-winged blackbird is in full retreat, along with our state bird, the western meadowlark. Since 1970, 70% of our eastern meadowlarks and 60% of our horned larks have vanished. Even robins, starlings and sparrows are in trouble.
   
 Researchers from these universities say birds are indicator species serving as barometers of environmental health. These mass declines in numbers signal the earth's biological systems are in trouble. Is it a problem? Or is it a crisis?
   
 Lee says whoever controls the habitat can have a big say in our future. And therein lies some good news. Populations of North American ducks and geese have grown by 56% since 1970, largely because hunters became deeply concerned about declines in duck populations that were every bit as severe as what we're seeing today with other species. As a result, laws were written to protect wetlands while conservation management was encouraged. Groups like Ducks Unlimited were especially influential and effective at turning near disaster into today's booming waterfowl populations.
   
 Wildlife biologist Kevin Luman with KDWPT says the pheasants and quail are still out there and can come back.
   
 "But they need habitat for that to happen," he said. "And that means we need a lot more outdoor diversity including such things as more wild flowers, pollinators and cover crops. We also need to do some other things like raise up combine heads when harvesting wheat or use stripper headers."
   
 Luman points out there are a lot of resources that farmers and landowners can use, including a Habitat First cost-share program.
   
 Here on our farm Louise and I have enrolled right at 500 acres of our least profitable and most unproductive land in a conservation program, which is now dedicated to wildlife habitat and aquifer recharge.
   
 We are also very excited to be working on a whole farm evaluation where we're looking at every field on the farm for opportunities to enhance the environment and wildlife.
   
 We'd probably be better off financially if all of our fields were flat Harney silt loam soils. But now when you drive past all of those perfectly flat fields with perfect weed control, you're starting to wonder if maybe there's something missing.

 Ms. Rupesh said very heavy vehicles from Udupi towards Bengaluru may move via Padubidri and Karkala while those bound to Mangaluru may ply via Mulki/Haleyangadi-Kinnigol i-Bajpe-Surathkal.
 She also directed NHAI to erect road median/cones on the new bridge and direction boards at Mulki, Moodbidri, Haleyangadi, Panambur etc., for the information of drivers. NHAI should also complete the ongoing road relaying work near KIOCL junction and provide sufficient illumination at the junction as well as on the new bridge, she said.
 NHAI Project Director Shishu Mohan told _The Hindu_ the repair and strengthening work should not take more than 15-20 days. Its pillars are strong enough, he said adding the repair work involves replacement of expansion joints and bearings between the pillars and girders and such other minor works.
 Work has already commenced beneath the bridge, he added.

The whole situation gives the people around Nia, particularly Kara and Brainy, some new perspective on what the trans community goes through, though they have trouble understanding why Nia reacts the way she does at first.
 "You have Supergirl, she's dealt with villains of all kinds before and she's really saying, hey, listen, we're going to get this guy, just stay with Yvette and make sure she's ok, this is what we do every week," Maines says. "And Nia says no, this is not what we do every week. This is not something that you understand. This is not something that you live with, hanging over your head. This is my community under assault. This is me, as a person, under assault. So she has her support, but really, this is an episode where Nia and where Dreamer really say, I feel just alone in this, and I feel this is something I need to do my way."

It was a routine game of schoolyard tag -- except the children had dubbed this version "coronavirus." The kids ran around and tagged one another, but instead of being "it," they "caught" the virus.
 Children like the ones a reporter saw playing recently at a school in Washington, D.C., are becoming more aware of the coronavirus -- though they may not fully understand it or know how seriously to take it -- as it begins to affect their daily lives with school closures and event cancellations, restrictions on travel, and the NBA nixing the rest of its season.
 Many parents are now deciding how to talk to their children about the virus. Some said they are checking in daily, while others worry talking about it could make their kids more anxious or fearful.
 "We talk about it a lot. I watch the news every morning, and they're always watching it, too," said Nicole Poponi, mother of Clara, 10, and Jane, 12, in the Philadelphia suburb of Audubon, New Jersey.
 Both girls said they've talked a little about the virus at school, but Jane, who is a few grades ahead, said she has talked about it much more, including in science lessons.
 "I'm not really as scared of it. It's still not even that many people getting sick here. And it's less dangerous than the flu," Jane said. "One of my friends is really scared of it, but she's honestly really scared of all diseases."
 Beth Young, who lives in Fort Mill, South Carolina, said she has decided to limit the conversation with her four kids, ages 8, 10, 12 and 15.
 "I don't want to doom and gloom them into being afraid of getting sick because, let's face it, kids get sick pretty often," she said. "And I don't need a sniffle to turn into them worrying about dying."
 For most people -- including children -- the new coronavirus, which causes a disease called COVID-19, results in only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.
 The vast majority of people recover. According to the World Health Organization, which has declared the outbreak a pandemic, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.
 Child psychology experts' advice is to be reassuring, focus on proactive steps and do research to truthfully answer children's questions.
 In Kathleen McEvoy's house in Norton, Massachusetts, she and her husband, Thom Daly, decided they wanted to talk with their 8-year-old daughter, Kennedy, before something like a quarantine or school closure was announced.
 "We thought it would be confusing and scary for a kid if they were told that school has to be closed for two weeks," McEvoy said. "We felt like it was important ... to give her a lot of information about how this might impact her life even if we don't know exactly how yet."
 McEvoy, 38, works as a paraprofessional at a different school district and said some second-graders had talked about how they thought the virus was spread. Some thought they could catch it from eating Chinese food or from touching bats or pigs.
 The teacher spent some time searching for an age-appropriate video to help them understand how the virus is actually spread, McEvoy said.
 It's important to reassure children, to ask whether they have questions and to stress safety, said Dr. Jamie Howard, a clinical psychologist at the nonprofit Child Mind Institute. The institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention both offer tips on talking to children.
 Some teachers and coaches are working to dispel any idea that the virus, which was first recorded in China, is tied to ethnicity or race.
 Seattle Public Schools posted on its website that misinformation has led to fear and hostility, and it urged students to combat racism and bias.
 "We are aware of reports that some of our Asian students have been targeted and discriminated against in connection to COVID-19. This is unacceptable and contrary to our values of racial equity and social justice," district leaders wrote.
 Lacy Hilbrich's two daughters, ages 14 and 18, are part of an online school that has students from all over the world. They live near Houston, but some of her daughters' classmates are in countries where there are quarantines in place.
 The virus, she said, has been part of her family's daily discussion.
 "In our family we all talk about it, so it's pretty open and so they're not hiding anything from us," said daughter Ally, 14. "And I think that's helped a lot."
 Parents should explain that measures like wearing face masks and closing schools are preventative and temporary, Howard said. She urged them to take a page from Mr. Rogers, who taught kids to "focus on the helpers" -- what doctors, teachers, parents and scientists are doing to keep them safe.
 Whatever the conversation looks like, Howard said, parents should not collude in their child's anxiety by refusing to go outside or by buying masks.
 "In doing those behaviors, you're saying this is really dangerous and we really are in danger right now," she said. "And that's not true, and it will make them more anxious."
