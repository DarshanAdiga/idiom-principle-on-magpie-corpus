Kubiak said on a Wednesday conference call that he has "a couple of world championship rings" from his time on the Broncos staff because of Hall of Famer Terrell Davis' ability to run the ball. Kubiak doesn't call the shots when it comes to contracts in Minnesota, however, so his opinion isn't going to help Dalvin Cook's push for a new deal.

The company did some investigating, and what it found has the entire processed food industry eagerly making new plans for our future. We may think that we turned a corner on our eating habits with all that sourdough baking we did, but Big Food isn’t about to let us off its hook that easily."There was a huge surge in sales of packaged food in mid-March as all the panic-buying played out across the country,” she said. “But sales are generally still extremely strong across the board due to the collapse in food service sales to restaurants, schools, etc.”

Even though it seems as if we're heading down the road back to normalcy, "normal" is going to look very different than we're used to—at least for the time being. But, to look on the bright side, there will be more outdoor seating at your favorite dine and drink establishments, and they will also be extra sanitary! The best part, however, is being able to gather together and interact with other humans again. For this year's Food & Drink issue, we've gathered together a variety of stories to show you what you can expect if you head out, downtown or around town.

Boston is the capital of one of our most progressive states, with a medical community that is second to none in the country. Now it needs a mayor and police commissioner who will do the right thing on substance use and homelessness. There are examples of cities whose approach Boston could replicate; Trieste, in Italy, and the Finnish capital, Helsinki, both have innovative approaches to homelessness and drug use. But adopting them would require building or converting more housing for those who are now homeless or in danger of becoming so, and hiring more social support workers rather than police to support those with substance use or mental health problems.

In the long run, though, such a strategy could also save money. Some studies suggest that every homeless person in properly supported housing reduces the need for spending on emergency health care, social services, and the criminal justice system by over $15,000. With discussion now raging all over the country about how to repurpose municipal budgets and shift money away from police departments, Boston could make a difference in the lives of its most vulnerable citizens by putting its money to a better purpose. Mayor Walsh has already announced that he’s shifting 20 percent of the police overtime budget, about $12 million, to social services in the city. As DA Rachael Rollins has said, “Investing resources in evidence-based solutions isn’t just the right thing to do; it’s the smart thing to do. Clearing the streets will not clear up the underlying problems, and in the end will cost us more money and more lives.”
