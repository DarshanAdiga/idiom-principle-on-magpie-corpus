SANFORD, Maine -- Those who fail to wear a face covering while around other people in public areas of the city risk being slapped with a $100 fine, under an emergency ordinance passed Thursday evening by the Sanford City Council.
   
 The ordinance, which took effect Friday, imposes stricter rules amid the COVID-19 pandemic and specifically grants enforcement authority to the Sanford Police Department, as the city grapples with several active outbreak investigations.
   
 People must wear a cloth covering over the nose and mouth when on streets or sidewalks, in parks and other places where people are gathered and unable to maintain at least 6 feet of distance from one another, according to the ordinance. Police are authorized to enforce that mask requirement and limits on the number of people who can gather in a given place.
   
 Up to 50 people are currently allowed to gather indoors, under the state's rules. And up to 100 people are currently permitted to gather outdoors, but they must have no more than five people per 1,000 square feet of space.
   
 A first offense under Sanford's emergency ordinance will result in a documented warning. A second may result in civil penalties of at least $100 per violation, plus court costs. A third offense by a business could lead to a temporary suspension of licensure, and a fourth could result in closure of a retail facility.
   
 Sanford Police Chief Thomas Connolly said during Thursday night's meeting that his department will look into every reported violation, while prioritizing responses to crimes and other emergency calls.
   
 The ordinance is set to be repealed after 91 days, unless the City Council approves an extension.
   
 The four current outbreak investigations in Sanford relate to the Lafayette Club, the American Legion, the Sanford Fire Department and Calvary Baptist Church, according to Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention Director Nirav Shah.
   
 There are two more outbreak investigations outside Sanford in York County, at Seal Rock Healthcare and the York County Jail.
   
 The positivity rate in York County stood at 2.1%, Shah said Thursday. That's quadruple the statewide average of 0.55%, he said.
   
 The rate of new cases over the past 14 days in York County stood at about 8 per 10,000 people, while the statewide average was 2.66 per 10,000 people, Shah said.

LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) — The Houston Rockets didn’t show up for Game 4 against the Los Angeles Lakers until it was too late. They can’t do that again Saturday in Game 5 — or else. For the second time in these playoffs, the Rockets’ season is on the line. The Lakers lead Houston 3-1 in their Western Conference semifinal series and could clinch their spot in the West finals with a win on Saturday night at Walt Disney World. It is the only game on Saturday’s NBA schedule. Houston has won an elimination game already; it beat Oklahoma City in Game 7 of the first round. Rockets coach Mike D’Antoni doesn’t want his club thinking about trying to win three games now, preferring instead to simply focus on getting one. “We’ve got to win the next game,” D’Antoni said. “It’s a one-game series and then we’ll see what happens.” The Lakers dropped Game 1 and trailed going into the fourth quarter of Game 2. They outscored the Rockets by 10 points in the final period of that game to even the series, beat them by 10 points again in Game 3 and 10 points yet again in Game 4. LeBron James is on the brink of another conference finals, and said he’s seeing a Lakers team that is in its first playoff run together continuing to grow. He thought the Lakers played 43 good minutes in Game 4; a five-minute stretch of the fourth where Houston outscored Los Angeles by 16 points and made it a two-possession game was the omission from his tally. “We want to strive for something better than that,” James said. “We want to work the game plan for 48 minutes. ... We’re still a team that’s growing. We’ve got some guys who have not been part of the postseason. This is our first run together.” NBA scoring champion James Harden was just 2 for 11 from the...

Perfusion devices are mechanical devices used in open-heart surgeries to bypass the blood from the lungs and heart and circulate the blood flow. Many children suffer from heart abnormalities and undergo heart surgeries that require perfusion products. On the back of these factors, the pediatric perfusion products market is anticipated to expand significantly over the forecast period, i.e., 2020-2028. Among the product type segmentation, pediatric cannulae segment is projected to hold the largest market share over the coming few years on account of widespread presence of pediatric respiratory problems, and helpful creation of cannulae’s that makes it suitable for neonatal use.

While yesterday’s announcement of the remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time was met with enthusiasm by long-term fans of the series, some people were unimpressed by the visuals of the updated take on the game. In an interview with The Mako Reactor, however, game director Pierre Sylvain-Gires suggested that the approach to the game’s visuals was a conscious choice by the teams behind it.
 Sylvain-Gires acknowledged that the 17-year-old original had “definite room for improvement” when it came to graphics, but the teams at Ubisoft Pune and Mumbai “really wanted to give a unique look to the game” that matched its fantastical elements.
 Because of that, the studios “decided to go for a unique visual treatment to make this game stand out from other games.” Capturing the Prince’s movement was different from the process used to make the Assassin’s Creed games, so Sylvain-Gires suggested that difference should extend to the visuals. “It’s not another Assassin’s Creed, it’s not like the same Prince of Persia from 2008. It has to be unique.” The attempt to capture the fantasy element “is shown through the saturation, through the light”.
 It appears that the visual style was entirely the studios’ choice - when pressed on whether the teams had had feedback from Ubisoft executives or been constrained by time or budget, Sylvain-Gires said that the process had been “completely led by Ubisoft Pune and Mumbai,” and that “it was not a problem of timeline or budget”. The remake has been in development for more than two years, and had a peak of 170 developers working on it, on top of the investment that Ubisoft has put into its broader studio infrastructure over the past few years.

As such, it’s way too early to discuss potential pricing or fuel economy, but the aforementioned Grand Cherokee SRT offers some clues. A starting price of about $65,000 wouldn’t be out of the question for a production Jeep Wrangler 392, representing a jump of about $36,000 over the base Wrangler (the Grand Cherokee SRT demands a similar premium relative to the Laredo). And the lighter Wrangler might get better fuel economy in the city than the GC’s 13 miles per gallon, though the vertical windshield and bluff front end might limit the highway number to 18 or 19.
