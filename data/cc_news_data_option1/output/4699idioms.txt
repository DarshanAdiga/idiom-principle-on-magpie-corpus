Hands-on experiences can give college students an advantage when it comes to securing a job after graduation.


  The Ecological Restoration Institute, which recently opened in the College of Agriculture, Food and Environmental Sciences at UW-River Falls, will offer trainings and certifications including boat safety, chainsaw safety, first aid, tractor training and wildland firefighter training to increase the eligibility, qualifications and marketability of students for jobs in natural resources.


  The mission of the institute, part of the Plant and Earth Science Department, is to enhance student skills in natural resource management through hands-on trainings and certifications, as well as teaching and work experiences associated with restoration projects.


  “The hands on experiences prepare students for the work place,” said Kelsey Cowart, Ecological Restoration Institute program manager. “They are earning trainings and with the restoration projects, they will be able to use those skills to provide them experience that will help build their resume.


  “We want students to engage in all parts of the restoration process in hopes that will make them more marketable to employers and help them earn a job within their career path that much faster.”


  The Ecological Restoration Institute will also allow students to pursue a commercial pesticide applicator license and take ATV/off-road education training through the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.


  The institute’s restoration projects will provide students with field experience that can be applied to their careers.


  One of the current projects involves the management of the open field behind the Agricultural Science building and the greenhouse on campus. The project will offer students experience in restoring native plants and using management practices such as herbicide application, prescribed burning, invasive species removal and water table monitoring. Students will be involved in this project throughout the 2020-21 academic year and beyond.


  Cowart said student workers are currently collecting data on the site before starting the restoration process.


  “We have ... what we’ve entitled ‘fellows’ who are focusing on data collection for our site,” she said. “Each student has a focus area, wildlife, soil health, and plant diversity to help give us a baseline so we know how our efforts will have an impact on the area with restoration.


  “Our management approach has been in the works and we hope to have a clear picture soon.”


  Cowart said that while the institute’s trainings in chainsaw, wildland fire, etc., “don’t necessarily have specific relation to the restoration project site, they will help prepare students when it’s time to work on the project.”


  The institute is funded through the Environmental Studies Opportunity Fund, a fund created and sponsored by donors to the University Foundation. The fund also provides scholarships to students majoring in conservation and environmental science.


  Cowart said the university has offered some of the trainings in the past, but they were at the expense of the students.


  “Now we have the institute to cover the cost and are able to offer more trainings to the benefit of the students,” she said.


  More information about the Ecological Restoration Institute is available at www.uwrf.edu/PES/ERI.cfm or by emailing kelsey.cowart@uwrf.edu.

Stokke has proven to be an effective red-zone threat as both runner and receiver. He has three total touchdowns this season, second on the team behind tight end Jake Ferguson, who has four receiving scores. Stokke has gained a total of 12 yards on his scoring plays.
 Opponents know the Badgers’ identity as a powerful running football team and UW is using defenses’ aggressiveness to stop the run against it, especially in the red zone. Both of Stokke’s receiving touchdowns came on play-action plays that held defenders’ attention on the backfield while Stokke went into his route.

Long viewed as the woman who could break this gender barrier in Major League Baseball, Ng said she felt an enormous responsibility to continue serving as an example for girls and young women, particularly those interested in baseball, a sport dominated by white men.
 "There’s an adage, ‘You can’t be it if you can’t see it,’ " Ng said. “I suggest to them, ‘Now they can see it.’ And so I look forward to hearing all of their stories and just how inspired they are to now pursue a job in sports, a job in baseball and to reach for the stars.”
 When Derek Jeter, the chief executive and a part owner of the Marlins, called Ng to tell her she had gotten the job, she said she felt a “10,000-pound” weight lifted off one shoulder. Then nearly 30 minutes later, she felt it had simply switched shoulders.
 “I know that I am quite visible,” she said, adding later, “You’re bearing a torch for so many.”
 Ng is believed to be the second person of Asian descent to lead an MLB team. Farhan Zaidi, who was born in Canada to parents from Pakistan, was the Los Angeles Dodgers' general manager from 2014-18 and is now the San Francisco Giants' president of baseball operations.
 Ng, who worked as an assistant general manager for the Dodgers and the New York Yankees, and most recently as MLB’s senior vice president for baseball operations, admitted feeling deflated over the years after interviewing for several general manager openings and not landing the gig.

LONDON (AP) — Dominic Thiem mastered the tiebreakers again to get the better of Rafael Nadal, beating the 20-time Grand Slam champion in straight sets on Tuesday for a second win at the ATP Finals.
 Thiem clinched a 7-6 (7), 7-6 (4) win on his fifth match point in their first meeting since the Australian Open quarterfinals in January, when the Austrian player prevailed after winning three tiebreakers in a tight four-set match.
 The U.S. Open champion opened group play in the season-ending event with a three-set victory over defending champion Stefanos Tsitsipas on Sunday, and will be guaranteed qualification for the semifinals if Tsitsipas beats tournament newcomer Andrey Rublev in the evening match.
 Nadal, who beat Rublev in straight sets in their opener, missed a chance to qualify with a match to spare and next will play Tsitsipas on Thursday with a semifinal place at stake. Nadal has never won the ATP Finals, which remains the biggest gap on his resume.
 Thiem, who described his performance as one of the best of his career, won the first set after coming from 5-2 down in the tiebreaker, saving two set points in the process.
 There was high-quality shot-making throughout the match, but not least when Thiem produced two inside-out forehand winners in a three-point span to close the tiebreaker — the first on set point for Nadal at 6-7 and then to clinch the set.

SALEM, Ore. (AP) — Tina Kotek has won her party’s nomination for an unprecedented fifth term as speaker of the Oregon House, withstanding a rare challenge from a fellow Democrat.
 However Oregon Public Broadcasting reports Rep. Janelle Bynum, the Clackamas County Democrat who has mounted a bid to unseat Kotek, announced Monday night she would continue to pursue the role despite not receiving the formal nomination of her caucus.

It offers longer battery life, silky smooth performance (without the need for a fan to power through tough tasks), and operates more like an iPhone and iPad — with the ability to download iOS apps right onto your computer. Thankfully, Apple has still managed to keep the starting price down to $999 for 256GB of storage.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives is asking the Supreme Court to put off upcoming arguments about whether Congress should have access to secret grand jury testimony from special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation.
 The House Judiciary Committee that takes office in January “will have to determine whether it wishes to continue pursuing the application for the grand-jury materials that gave rise to this case,” Douglas Letter, the top lawyer for the House said in a written filing Tuesday. Letter noted that President Donald Trump's defeat in his bid for reelection could affect the committee's decision.
 The case is scheduled to be argued on Dec. 2.
 The material initially was sought in the summer of 2019 as part of the committee's investigation of possible misconduct by Trump, including whether he obstructed Mueller's investigation. Mueller’s 448-page report, issued in April 2019, “stopped short” of reaching conclusions about Trump’s conduct to avoid stepping on the House’s impeachment power, the federal appeals court in Washington said in March when it ruled that the materials should be turned over.
 By the time of the appellate ruling, Trump had been impeached by the House for his efforts to get Ukraine to announce an investigation of Democrat Joe Biden, and acquitted by the Senate.
 The Supreme Court effectively kept the grand jury documents secret through the election in a series of orders in the spring and early summer.
 Now it's possible the justices might never have to reach a definitive ruling in a sensitive dispute between the executive and legislative branches of government.
 Democrats had suggested that previously undisclosed details from the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election could reveal new misconduct that could have potentially formed the basis of new articles of impeachment.
 But it's unclear how many new, or incendiary, revelations might be contained in the grand jury transcripts. Mueller’s report, though redacted in parts, revealed significant information about the president’s efforts to choke off the investigation and raised substantial questions about whether he had committed obstruction of justice.

"It is important that COVID patients who need skilled nursing care in a licensed-facility but do not need hospital care not take up hospital capacity," Leahy said.


  As the number of COVID-19 patients increases, Leahy noted that hospital staff and health care workers will likely decrease due to community spread. On Monday, Missoula County reported an additional 255 new COVID-19 cases since its last update on Friday, Nov. 13, bringing the county to a total of 1,076 active cases. The incidence rate also hit 78 cases per 100,000 residents, well above the 25 cases per 100,000 threshold beyond which a locality may tip into uncontrolled spread, according to the Harvard Global Health Institute.

There are some obvious reasons for the drop, of course. Sports ratings as a whole are suffering amidst the pandemic, and the Masters has a lot of its identity wrapped up in its traditional spring spot on the calendar.

Johnny Isakson – loses in the runoff election, the math would slightly change to 20 Republican and 14 Democratic seats in play in the 2022 midterms.

RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) — A senior Palestinian official says the Palestinian Authority will restore ties with Israel after it cut all contacts in May over Israel’s planned annexation of up to a third of the occupied West Bank. The move to restore ties likely reflects the Palestinians’ hopes that the election of former Vice President Joe Biden spells the end of the Trump administration’s Mideast policies, which overwhelmingly favored Israel. A senior Palestinian official and close aide to President Mahmoud Abbas, tweeted Tuesday that “the relationship with Israel will return to how it was” following “official written and oral letters we received” confirming Israel’s commitment to past agreements.

 The school district anticipated this surge in its COVID-19 reopening health and safety plan and is now in the process of making it easier for families to report exposure, Hanks said.
 "As a school district, we remain committed to doing our best to keep children in school. If at any time we feel that we are unable to manage the increase in cases, we will move to a two-week virtual setting for any classroom, grade level, or building impacted," Hanks wrote. "We know that those families that opted for in-person instruction have done so with great faith and trust in our school team and our health and safety plan. We thank you for your confidence and will continue to care for every child as though they were our own."
