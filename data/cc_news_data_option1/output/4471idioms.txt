Louie's cousin Reece Jones, 25, who lives in Bradford, said: "They have tried every treatment and even Great Ormond Street [Hospital] had a look to do a T-Cell transplant but this proved a no go.
 "We’ve been left in the situation we are in where he only has a few weeks left.
 "They are at this moment giving him chemotherapy to control the leukaemia and to give a bit of time to enjoy his life.
 "Louie has taken everything on board and followed everything to a T, done exactly what has been asked of him and never complained.
 "He has and still is being ultra brave and keeps fighting. And to this end we burst with pride everyday."
 Louie, from Poulton-le-Fylde in Lancashire, is currently receiving treatment at Manchester Children's Hospital, with his mum Caroline and dad Glyn by his side.
 The teenager, who adores Leeds United and loves science, had been fit and healthy before his shock diagnosis which "came out of nowhere" for the family.

An established series like “This Is Us” faces different obstacles when dipping into current events. If the Pearsons wear masks and talk about COVID-19, and if Randall Pearson’s Black family agonizes over George Floyd’s death, then who are the Pearsons voting for? How can a series be so “on the nose,” as Hollywood puts it, about viruses and protests, while ignoring the most divisive election of our times?
 It can’t. Fogelman was right to skip the election, telling the LA Times, “I don’t think our show is the forum for it.” But he was creatively misguided to cherry-pick other topics from the headlines. Earlier, for example, the show developed a compelling political theme about Sterling K. Brown’s character, Randall Pearson, running for city council in Philadelphia, while staying clear of real-life politics. Similarly, we see Pearson exploring his Black identity, but we don’t need it reinforced by actual news about protests in Minneapolis.

OTTAWA - Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole is calling for the Liberals to put a pause on federal audits of small businesses hit hard by COVID-19.
 He says too many small and medium-sized businesses are struggling to survive during the pandemic, and still have been hit by what he calls unfair audit requests from the Canada Revenue Agency.
 O'Toole says his party will use its time on the House of Commons agenda today to also propose changes to the federal wage subsidy and commercial rent-relief programs.
