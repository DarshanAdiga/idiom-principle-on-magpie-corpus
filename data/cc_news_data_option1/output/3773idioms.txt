PENSACOLA, Fla. (WEAR) - A woman took video as Hurricane Sally flooded her apartment complex last week.The only way out for Cetoria Holley was to swim. She escaped through the window, with her 1-year-old grandson on her back.“Are we even going to make it through the night?” she said. “Are we going to survive this? Because it got that bad.”She said around 7 in the morning, the water continued to rise, and she had to evacuate.“We ended up jumping out of my back window and swimming to a higher ground behind us,” Holley said. “And water moccasins were right beside me, swimming.”Dozens living in the apartment complex had to be rescued from their homes that morning.John Honeycutt doesn’t live there, but he took a canoe and rescued at least seven people and two dogs. He said the water reached to chest level at one point.“I heard children crying, so I went over there and got a canoe boat,” he said. “I went through here saving people, you know what I’m saying? It was just an act … it wasn’t nothing that I thought about doing.”The recovery process is far from over. Escambia County had not yet received an emergency declaration from FEMA, which would free up much-needed money to help the community rebuild.Holley said the help is needed now before it’s too late.“I have patience, but I don’t have patience,” she said. "I don’t, because at the end of the day this is all I have. I was at rock bottom before I came here. I don’t have nothing.“Put yourself in our shoes - this is not right and not fair.”Copyright 2020 [station] via CNN Newsource. All rights reserved.

The Liverpool boss had faced plenty of calls for further firepower to be added to the ranks at Anfield, despite landing a long-awaited Premier League title in 2019-20.


  Mohamed Salah, Mane and Roberto Firmino form one of the most devastating attacking tridents in world football, but they do need support from a deeper talent pool.


  Klopp has sought to address those issues by bringing in Jota, with the Portuguese acquired from Wolves for £41m ($53m).


  Murphy admits that deal “came of the blue”, but he is not surprised to see Liverpool rolling the dice again on a 23-year-old with plenty of potential still to be unlocked.


  The Reds have found considerable value across their recent transfer business, snapping up the likes of Alisson and Virgil van Dijk, and Jota is being tipped to become the latest success story.


  Ex-Reds star Murphy told _talkSPORT_: “The recruitment history of Liverpool has been phenomenal in the last few seasons.


  “Jota came out of the blue, I didn’t see that one coming. He’s a talent, he can play across the front three, he’s versatile, he’s hungry.


  “Time will tell on that [whether he is value for money]. People turned their nose up at Mane for £30m from Southampton, so who are we to question their judgement?


  “I think he is somebody who is definitely at the right age in terms of wanting to improve and get better.


  “Klopp generally improves players as well and if you’ve got someone who got 17 goals for Wolves last season under the management of Klopp and around better players, why can’t he kick on again?

Coinciding with these facts, the animal presented severe respiratory difficulties and was taken to a veterinary hospital in Badalona (Barcelona), where it was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Due to a terminal condition the hospital decided to do a humanitarian euthanasia. The necropsy, performed at the High Biosafety Level Laboratories of the Animal Health Research Center (CReSA) at IRTA, confirmed that Negrito suffered from feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and had no other lesions or symptoms compatible with a coronavirus infection. The RT-PCR test confirmed that the animal had become infected with SARS-CoV-2, but with a very low and residual viral load.

Taking the knee before football matches is not going to change attitudes to racism only actions will, Les Ferdinand, director of football at English second tier side Queens Park Rangers said on Monday.
 The 53-year-old former England striker was responding to criticism that neither players from QPR nor opponents Coventry took the knee prior to their game on Friday.
 QPR players also did not take the knee in their opening game of the season.
 Taking the knee has been adopted by English football leagues as a form of showing their unity in tackling racism which was sparked by the death of unarmed African-American man George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody on May 25.
 Ferdinand, though, said the gesture is no longer effective.
 "The message has been lost," said Ferdinand in a statement published on the club website.
 "It is now not dissimilar to a fancy hashtag or a nice pin badge.
 "Taking the knee will not bring about change in the game -- actions will."
 Ferdinand, who is a rarity in English football in being black and in a high profile management role, said like the 'Clap for Carers' which took place on a Thursday during the coronavirus lockdown it had run its course.
 "Taking the knee was very powerful but we feel that impact has now been diluted," said Ferdinand.
 "In the same way 'Clap For Carers' was very emotional for us all, it got to a stage where it had run its natural course and the decision was rightly made to stop it.
 "Does that mean we, as a nation, don't care or appreciate our NHS workers? Of course it doesn't."
 Ferdinand, who admitted earlier this year he had been racially abused both when he was a player and in his present role by QPR fans, said he no longer gives interviews on racism because "the debate was going round in circles."
 "No-one is more passionate than me about this topic (racism)," he said.
 "I have spoken on the matter throughout my footballing life.
 "I work for one of the most diverse football clubs in this country.
 "A lot of people are being fooled out there."
 Ferdinand -- cousin of former Manchester United and England central defender Rio -- said taking the knee is not going to resolve the racism issue in football.
 "What are our plans with this?"
 "Will people be happy for players to take the knee for the next 10 years but see no actual progress made?
 "Taking the knee will not bring about change in the game -- actions will."

The Norwegian has added the likes of Harry Maguire, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Bruno Fernandes to his ranks while bringing the best out of previously inconsistent stars Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford, with a view to bringing back the glory days of Sir Alex Ferguson's 27-year reign.


  United managed to secure a third-place finish and Champions League qualification last season, while reaching three major semi-finals, with Solskjaer widely praised for implementing an attacking philosophy that had been abandoned under his predecessors Jose Mourinho and Louis van Gaal.


  However, a lack of activity during the summer transfer window has led to a tense atmosphere among supporters, and frustrations boiled over following the Red Devils' 3-1 humbling at home to Crystal Palace on Saturday.


  Many fans and experts are now calling for Solskjaer's head after the club's first opening day defeat in six years, but McClaren feels he has been subjected to unfair criticism after a significantly reduced pre-season.


  The former United coach told _talkSPORT_ when quizzed on their display against Palace: “It’s a massive overreaction, it’s their first game of the season. As Sir Alex used to say, you never win something in September, October, November.


  “Manchester United, since that semi-final have had two weeks rest, two weeks preparation, one game and they expect to produce a performance of the level of which they ended last season which let’s not forget was an incredible finish to the season – top four, semi-final of Europa.


  “I think, yes, United were poor. Was it expected? Yeah, I think behind the scenes Ole will say ‘we’re not ready’. It’s not an excuse. They haven’t had enough preparation time, let’s judge them in five/ten games. That’s what I always say. Then you can say it’s not right, but after one? Nah, you have to wait.

Greer, who calls himself "a mad gold bull," believes the big opportunities in the gold markets lies in getting mutual fund investors to adjust their allocation to gold stocks from 50 basis points where he believes it is now to 75 basis points or 1.5% or even 2%.


  "That would be a material change, and you will see them go straight north from where they are now," he said. "That's a trade on my radar because it feels right to be in gold stocks now. I'm just on the lookout for this potential boost in gold if interest rates go higher from here."


  ## How Greer trades


  A self-proclaimed "slave to chart patterns", Greer likes when his technical indicators are flashing clear signals.


  He watches momentum indicators like the relative strength index to inform his trading decisions.


  "When I wake up bullish, I want to trade things that are going up. I'm trying to find stocks that have been sort of trending lower and then break above that downtrend line and moving averages," Greer said.


  "Sometimes you take what you can get. If a pattern is right and the risk/reward is right where it looks like you can put your stop loss nice and close and just tap a bit and run away if things go wrong," he added. "That's really what I like to keep as my bread and butter and I like to keep it that simple."

The authors' new reconstruction of the hip structure showed that Euparkeria had a distinctive bony rim on the pelvis, called a supra-acetabular rim, covering the top of the hip joint. This feature was previously known only from later archosaurs on the line to crocodiles and often was used to infer a more erect posture for these animals; reversed in crocodiles as they became more amphibious. The hooded rim allowed the pelvis to cover the top of the thigh bone and support the body with the limbs in a columnar arrangement; hence this type of joint is called 'pillar-erect'. Euparkeria is so far the earliest reptile with this structure preserved. Could it therefore have assumed a more erect, rather than more sprawling, posture as well?

The Anfield legend made that claim on the back of an uncharacteristic error from Van Dijk in a thrilling 4-3 victory over Leeds on the opening day of the new Premier League season.


  Many were quick to put that down as a rare off day, with the £75 million ($96m) asset on Merseyside having been a model of consistency throughout much of his time at Liverpool.


  The 29-year-old has enjoyed a meteoric rise to prominence since joining the Reds, with his profile rising rapidly to the point that many now consider him to sit among the world’s elite performers.


  Kieft suggests Van Dijk needs to seek out continuous improvement and not rest on his laurels once reaching the top.


  Kieft, who earned 42 caps for the Netherlands in his playing days and was part of the Euro 88 winning squad, told _De Telegraaf_ of Van Dijk: “He is not sharp, he behaves with the Oranje and Liverpool like the finished star, the great coaching leader, who shows a little too much that he does not like his fellow players.


  “At the same time, he plays lazy and nonchalant himself. He makes mistakes and often runs away from defensive handiwork in matches. With his status, he should be at the forefront of the battle.

Democratic nominee Joe Biden's campaign has closed what once seemed like an insurmountable fundraising gap from back in the spring, bludgeoning the Trump campaign three-to-one in ad spending in August and sitting on a $141 million edge in cash on hand, according to the latest FEC filings and disclosures from the campaigns.


  In addition to the latest batch of filings, which went up Sunday night, the firm Advertising Analytics found the Biden campaign spent $65.5 million on TV ads through the last four weeks of August.


  The Trump campaign only spent $18.7 million in that same timeframe.


  The ad spending partially reveals where the campaigns believe the race is the most competitive, with states like Florida getting bombarded with ads while other battleground states have seen the Trump campaign pull back on the airwaves.

Putting together fantasy wide receiver rankings for Week 3 feels like a fool's errand in many ways. There are so many injuries up and down the ranks, starting at the top with Michael Thomas, Chris Godwin, Davante Adams, and A.J. Brown. As we move down, we encounter guys like Kenny Golladay, Courtland Sutton, Jamison Crowder, and Parris Campbell -- all of whom matter who matter in some form. Hopefully you have healthy wideouts or a good position in your league's waiver order because you'll need it -- just like we'll need an eraser for the frequent updates we'll be making to this list throughout the week.
 We won't have a good read on all the injuries until later in the week, so our time right now is better spent analyzing what we should and shouldn't believe in so far. One team that has us believing in all of its key receivers is the Falcons. They seem intent on throwing the football all over the place, mostly to Julio Jones, Calvin Ridley and Russell Gage. Jones and Ridley are unquestioned every-week starts at this point, while Gage is worth adding and considering in PPR formats and some deeper standard leagues, too.
