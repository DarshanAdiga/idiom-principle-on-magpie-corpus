 # COVID positive cases, positivity rates in decline
 By Tim Croft
 The Star
 There is light at the end of that tunnel that is COVID-19.
 According to the Florida Department of Health in Gulf County, there were just 10 new cases between Aug. 28 and Sept. 1.
 Further, last week’s positivity rate fell to 9 percent, under the 10 percent goal and less than half the positivity rate just a month ago.
 State positivity rates are just above 6 percent, according to the FDOH dashboard.
 “It is a great sign,” said Sarah Hinds, Administrator of the Florida Department of Health in Gulf and Franklin County.
 “Overall, things are going well. Cases have dropped. Our clinic team reports no clusters of any kind so far.”
 Hinds added that medical capacity, monitored daily, “remains stable.”
 In the public schools, Hinds added, school nurses, also health professionals are focused on keeping as many students in class as they can while meeting CDC guidelines.
 “We really appreciate the leadership of (Superintendent of Schools Jim) Norton and the school district staff,” Hinds said.
 She also noted the testing turnaround time is faster than in previous months.
 And some of the basics have not changed:
 “If you are sick, seriously, stay home,” Hinds said. “It may be just allergies, but it may not be.
 “Just stay home if you are not feeling well.”
 Practice social distancing while out and about and wear a face mask when one cannot socially-distance, according to the CDC.
 If an individual has had close contact with someone who tests positive, within six feet for at least 15 minutes, quarantine.
 The state is soon to allow visitation again at long-term care facilities, Hinds said.
 Hinds also emphasized the health department remains open to anyone who needs an appointment and continues to provide free COVID-19 testing.
 “I’d like to personally thank my entire public health team at the Florida Department of Health in Franklin and Gulf,” Hinds said.
 “They continue to work so hard to keep our communities as safe as possible. We know it’s not over, but we are watching our cases drop and statewide trends move in the right direction.”
 Hinds continued by adding that, “Public health staff have worked many late nights at the office and every weekend since March. We have certainly tried to be available to anyone who needed us anytime of the day in both counties.
 “And we have tried to turn any fear about this pandemic into community action to protect the most vulnerable. It has always been about protecting our most vulnerable residents.
 As of press time for this edition, the county had 827 positive cases, a drop from 891 last week at this time.
 More than 200 of those are inmates at Gulf Correctional Institution.
 The total number of deaths has risen in the past week from eight to 12.
 There have been 46 hospitalizations.
 As of press time, there were 624,116 positive cases, up from 599,176 the week before.
 Statewide hospitalizations have increased from 37,038 to 38,859 and deaths from 10,717 to 11,421.

L’antica chiesa di Santa Croce, ridotta ormai ad un desolato rudere, sorge nell’omonimo borgo ubicato a nord - est del paese. Di questa chiesa non si conosce l’epoca precisa della sua fondazione, ma sappiamo che esisteva già nel 1375. Proprio alle spalle esisteva nel 1799 un giardino di circa _un moggio e un quarto_ , appartenente alla parrocchia e affittato a tale _Scipione di Amato_ , come si evince dalla mappa catastale della Terra di Somma del cartografo Luigi Marchese di quell’epoca.

I’ve always appreciated Spock’s ability to be purely logical, which is pit against McCoy’s folksy manner and moral commentary. The characters are excellent role models themselves, typically very annoyed at each another but also complimenting their respective strengths. Even though they can be viciously blunt with one another, there’s a foundation of professional respect aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.
 I wish people in our country could be more like Spock and McCoy these days, engaging in the spirited back-and-forth without always being on the verge of starting a mutiny. Maybe we lack a Kirk figure, a strong but compassionate and measured leader, to balance the two. I’d take a Jean Luc Picard right about now.
 In the Star Trek fictional universe, everybody on Earth co-exists, having abandoned selfish ways and greed. Not thrilling drama, though, so conflict was generated by the original villains, the Klingons. Then, over a long time, they became allies, the antagonists becoming the Romulans. Then the brutal Cardassians (Kardashians?) and the goofy Ferengi, the shapeshifting Changelings of the Dominion, and my favorite baddies, the Borg. The show is built on hope of a better tomorrow, yet the storytelling reflects a depressing truth about human nature.
 We ultimately make peace only when we share common enemies and need to unite against mutual threats.
 When the Soviet Union collapsed, we found ourselves battling international terrorism. When ISIS got snuffed out, we fought the menacing “other” closer to home. And on and on until balance elsewhere has us at our neighbor’s throat, trying to kill each other over one cutting down another’s favorite tree. We may never experience a society where all of our needs are met and we all just hold hands and sing Kumbaya in blissful harmony. No, in the real world, someone’s always going to try to dominate others and force reluctant submission to their will.
 Star Trek is a show about ideals like equality and self-determination. Even if a goal is ultimately unattainable, we should “reach for the stars” anyway because just look at how far we can move in the direction of the good, even if it isn’t the perfect. A toast to the undiscovered country, the future.
 I realize it’s all make-believe (for now). But with such a vast universe, I wouldn’t be all that shocked if alien visitors played cosmic Christopher Columbus, arriving with a flag of peace and then gobbling up our resources. Which of us would be served as steak dinner and which would they collar as their pets?

Star Trek is an awesome fantasy, zipping around the galaxy at the speed of light, visiting alien worlds and watching Capt. Kirk make out with green women.
 James T. was one cool customer, equally capable of diplomacy and anger. What a great role model for kids watching the show in the late 60s when it felt like the world was falling apart. I’ve met many of the actors from the shows (yeah, I’m a nerd) but never Shatner. I’ve heard the story of how he visited Jeff Cook a few year’s back.
 The other leads on the show were Leonard Nimoy and Forrest DeKelly playing First Officer Spock and ship physician Leonard “Bones” McCoy, played in the movie reboot by Zachary Quinto and Karl Urban. When I attended the first-ever week of Space Camp in Huntsville (told ya I was a nerd), my team member nickname was “Bones” because I was skinny as a rail.

The questions surrounding the Dallas Stars and Colorado Avalanche before Game 6 of their Stanley Cup playoff series focused on the goaltending carousel.
 Heading into Friday's seventh and deciding game in their Western Conference semifinal, the main question surrounds the health of one player -- Avalanche captain Gabriel Landeskog.
 Late in the second period of Colorado's 4-1 win on Wednesday that forced the win-or-go-home Game 7 in Edmonton, Landeskog suffered what appeared to be a cut leg when the skate of teammate Cale Makar clipped him just above his right knee. Landeskog returned with eight minutes remaining in the game, but had just one shift. It lasted only 16 seconds.
 Colorado is missing a slew of players. But the Avalanche erased a 3-1 series deficit with their top two goaltenders in Philipp Grubauer and Pavel Francouz, defenseman Erik Johnson and forwards Matt Calvert and Joonas Donskoi all shelved. Defenseman Conor Timmins was injured in the second period of Game 6 and didn't return.
 Coach Jared Bednar wouldn't divulge on Thursday whether any of those players could suit up.
 Regardless, the Game 7 showdown should be a doozy. Colorado last reached a conference final in 2002 while the Stars haven't been that far since 2008. Both teams lost in Game 7 in the second round last year.
 "Regardless of where you're born, Game 7 is a universal language," Colorado defenseman Ian Cole said.
 This marks the third time the Avalanche and Stars have met in a Game 7, and Dallas won both the previous meetings in 1998-99 and 1999-2000. Through six games, it's been a throwback series, with the teams having combined for 48 goals.
 The Avalanche went into the series as favorites, but the pressure appears to be on the Stars, having failed twice to close out a series in big part because the top line of Jamie Benn, Alexander Radulov and Tyler Seguin have managed just one point in the past two defeats.
 "Need them to produce, simple as that," Dallas coach Rick Bowness said. "That's what we talked about after (Wednesday's) game. Their top players are producing and our top players are not."
 The stats bear out the assessment.
 Colorado's Nathan MacKinnon collected one goal and two points in Game 6 and extended his point streak to 14 games, while winger Mikko Rantanen has consecutive two-point games and a nine-game spree on the go. Moreover, the Avalanche have won twice with third-string goalie Michael Hutchinson between the pipes. Should the Stars lose, it will be one big missed opportunity.
 "We all know what happened last year," Seguin said. "We were in this position, a chance to win it in Game 6. ... We lost last year. We have a chance to redeem ourselves."
 Then again, the disappointment for Colorado would be no less. In fact, clawing back only to fall short in a Game 7 could be even more heart breaking.
 "In terms of Game 7, it's my third one I guess. I haven't won one yet," MacKinnon said. "It's going to be the toughest game for us to win. I think we have created some momentum for our team, and you know we're learning. I think right now we are either winning or learning and that's the key. Looking for the same effort, same responsibility as (Wednesday), a little bit better start, but we are happy with our defensive game."

Lionel Messi ended speculation about his future at Barcelona by announcing on Friday that he would reluctantly stay for another season rather than tackle his career-long club in court.
 A week after saying he wanted to leave the Liga side, and with a contract row still raging, the 33-year-old six-time player of the year gave the news Barca fans were hoping for.
 In doing so, however, the Argentine forward took a big swipe at the club's hierarchy.
 "I wasn't happy and I wanted to leave. I have not been allowed this in any way and I will STAY at the club so as not to get into a legal dispute," he was quoted as saying by Goal.com.
 "The management of the club led by (president Josep Maria) Bartomeu is a disaster.
 "I told the club, the president in particular, that I wanted to leave. They knew this since the start of the past season. I told them during all (of the) last 12 months. But I will stay here because I don't want to start a legal war."
 By remaining at the Catalan club for the fourth and final year of his contract the six-time world player of the year is in line for a 63 million pounds ($83.38 million) loyalty bonus and will be able to leave without a transfer fee.
 "I will continue at Barca and my attitude will not change no matter how much I have wanted to go," he said. "I wanted to go because I thought about living my last years of football happily. Lately I have not found happiness within the club."
 Earlier on Friday, Messi's father and representative Jorge had insisted in a letter to La Liga that a 700 million euros ($828.03 million) release clause in the player's contract was not valid and his son could leave for free.
 However, despite the standoff between the Messi camp and Barcelona and La Liga, the player has ended the impasse and will see out his contract with the club with whom he has won more than 30 major trophies and scored over 600 goals.
 Barcelona crashed out of the Champions League last month with an 8-2 demolition by eventual winners Bayern Munich, and hired Ronald Koeman to replace sacked coach Quique Setien.
 CLUBS DISAPPOINTED
 The news that Messi will be staying at the Nou Camp, albeit reluctantly, will disappoint the clubs who were hoping to sign the iconic forward, including Premier League Manchester City, managed by his former Barca boss Pep Guardiola.
 Argentine pay TV station TYC Sports, which has close links with Messi, had reported earlier on Friday that Messi was poised to stay with the Catalan club he joined as a teenager.
 The situation was further complicated when Jorge Messi wrote to La Liga president Javier Tebas dismissing their claim that the release clause still applied if his son wished to leave.
 He accused La Liga, who on Sunday backed Barca's stance, of making an error in their interpretation of the contract.
 La Liga responded to Jorge Messi's letter by saying it stood by a statement in support of Barcelona issued on Sunday.
 Messi dropped the bombshell last week that he wanted to leave the club and that he could do so on a free transfer.
 On Sunday he failed to show up for a pre-season medical, making a move away look even more likely.
 His lawyers wanted to invoke a clause in his four-year contract, signed in 2017, which would have allowed the forward to leave the club for free if he had requested it by June 10.
 They argued that that date -- nominally the end of the season -- was irrelevant after the novel coronavirus pandemic forced an extension of the La Liga campaign deep into August.

The San Francisco 49ers activated wide receiver and kick returner Richie James from the non-football injury list Thursday.
 James, who broke a bone in his right wrist during workouts before training camp, could be cleared in time for the Sept. 13 season opener against the visiting Arizona Cardinals.
 James, who turns 25 on Saturday, also spent time on the COVID-19 list earlier this summer.
 Also on Thursday, the Niners put wide receiver Tavon Austin on injured reserve with a knee injury. He will miss the season; players put on IR prior to final cuts are ineligible to return. Austin joins fellow WRs Jalen Hurd and JJ Nelson on IR.
 Austin signed with San Francisco in mid-August. A first-round draft pick of the then St. Louis Rams in 2013, Austin has 15 career touchdown receptions and 10 touchdown runs in 96 games (50 starts). He was competing for a spot on the 53-man roster.
 A seventh-round pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, James has gained 1,634 all-purpose yards in 29 games with the 49ers.
 Last season, he returned 33 punts for 264 yards and 20 kickoffs for 428 yards and added six receptions for 165 yards and one touchdown.

The teams combined for 34 points in the second frame — but the host Cavaliers accounted for 28 of them as they held the Summers County offense scoreless in a 34-6 victory Friday night.
 Spurring the Cavaliers was senior quarterback Kaiden Pack, who ran for a touchdown and threw for another while coming away with an interception — all in the second quarter.
 "Kaiden's just a good overall athlete," Greenbrier West head coach Toby Harris said. "We were struggling there a little bit and he just broke the game open when he broke that long run and it set us on fire. He played really solid on defense, too, because that (Keandre) Sarver kid is a good receiver and he played real solid back there in the secondary."
 Pack's second quarter breathed life into a Cavalier offense that struggled to capitalize on a Summers County fumble in Bobcat territory less than a minute into the game. His 61-yard touchdown run early in the second quarter was a quick scoring strike before both offenses again went silent before a flurry of fireworks to end the half.
 With just under three minutes left in the second quarter, Levi Weikle capped a drive with a 4-yard rushing score, and Pack found Lawson Vaughan on the conversion to make it 16-0.
 Summers, while struggling on offense, found a sliver of space on a short kick from West on the ensuing kickoff and Landon Richmond capitalized, returning the kick 59 yards to get the Bobcats on the board.
 It took West just 1:22 of game time to answer as Pack dropped back and tossed a 55-yard touchdown to Kadin Parker with a blitzer bearing down on him.
 "We had a miscommunication in the secondary and didn't get the coverage relayed all the way over like we were supposed to," Summers County head coach Chris Vicars said.
 The Cavs added one more for good measure as all-stater Noah Brown rumbled in from a yard out with with seven seconds left to make it 28-6.
 "They loaded the box on us and were keying on Noah really hard," Harris said. "They did a good job of keeping us from running the ball inside, but when they did that it opened stuff up outside and we were able to throw the ball. We've been working on passing a lot. We were delighted to see Kaiden hit some passes tonight and open things up."
 In the second half it was more of the same as the Bobcats, struggling with the wet, muddy field, turned the ball over two more times, bringing their total to four on the night as West's Cole McClung scored the lone touchdown of the half.
 "They're a heck of a football team and well-coached," Vicars said. "Their advantage is our weakness — up front on the lines. Their size, strength and aggression, we just don't have a lot of experience there. We had freshmen up their starting, so that's where our weakness was. We're not big up there and they were able to take advantage of us.
 "We couldn't win at the point of attack the way we hoped to and the field conditions probably hurt us a little bit because we thought we might have a speed advantage. We just couldn't get that to work for us tonight, for a variety of reasons, not just the field conditions."
 Despite the lackluster showing on offense, Vicars was impressed with what his defense was able to accomplish after the offense turned the ball over four times.

Together, the two stores will use 4,000 square feet in an open-concept design.
 The Varners bought the property for $103,000, including auction fees. They plan to put about $50,000 into renovations. The kitchen has already been gutted. The basement, previously a banquet area, has water damage. The couple said it’s a “bonus space” they plan to develop.
 They are working with Anthony Dean-Neil, CEO of EO Media Solutions out of Boswell, to market the effort. It’s a special project for Dean-Neil, as his wedding reception was at Lamonica’s. The restaurant was a popular fixture in Somerset County for years.
 “For me to see a business go in that location — that’s prime real estate,” he said, estimating that thousands of cars pass by the site each day. “Instead of going to Pittsburgh, they can come right here.”
 Thomas Varner said the location is in the Somerset and Johnstown markets, as well as in position to land the Ligonier-to-Bedford traffic.
 He and his wife view the building as a place to put down roots for their growing family.

Beginning in Northwest Alabama, the Reynolds Aluminum Plant in Sheffield and Florence was union. The Tennessee Valley workers throughout North Alabama were all union. The paper mill and Goodrich Tire Plant in Tuscaloosa were union.
 The largest employer in Gadsden, the Goodyear Tire Factory, was union.
 The Lee County Tire Manufacturing Plant was union. The military base employees at Ft. Rucker in the wiregrass were union.
 The largest employer in Mobile was the state docks. Guess what, Folks? All those workers belong to the union.
 The largest employer in Birmingham, as well as the largest employer in the State of Alabama, were the steel mills and U.S. Steel. You guessed it – the steel workers were all unionized. In fact, the Steel Workers Union in Birmingham was the largest in the nation.
 The GOP ticket that appears on the ballot in 60 days will be a powerful triumvirate. It has gone under the radar since the presidential and senate races have taken center stage, but popular PSC President Twinkle Andress Cavanaugh is up for reelection. Thus, the Republican ticket will feature and illustrious alliteration of Trump/Tuberville/Twinkle, which will be hard to beat in the Heart of Dixie.
 Happy Labor Day!

Didymo is usually found in cold, stagnant waterways. Lichvar said the reservoir is considered a warm-to-cool waterway, but there are deep pockets where the water gets extremely cold.
 “That could make the didymo prosper,” he said.
 Lichvar added that the rock snot was likely introduced via humans traveling from the Delaware River, Youghiogheny River Lake or some other waterway.
 “There’s been a high increase in outdoor recreation because of COVID-19 and increased recreation at the reservoir. They’ve had a record number of people,” he said. “If they did not clean their equipment, they could easily transport the spores of didymo in new locations.”
 In every summer month this year, the Quemahoning Family Recreation Area was visited by an added 1,000 families over last year. In July there were 2,751 parking passes sold compared to 1,825 passes sold in July 2019.
 The reservoir also provides millions of gallons of water each year to thousands of people and businesses from Johnstown to Somerset.
 “It’s not necessarily good news,” Lichvar said of the possibility of didymo in the reservoir. “But it doesn’t mean the Quemahoning Reservoir is in peril or the Quemahoning Creek trout fishery will be eliminated.”
 The Fish and Boat Commission urged everyone using the Quemahoning Reservoir and Creek to thoroughly clean their equipment that may have come in contact with any algae.
 “The PFBC recommends that anglers allow exposed equipment to completely dry before entering new waters. After equipment is dry to the touch, allow to dry another 48 hours. Thick and dense material such as life jackets or felt-soled wading gear will hold moisture longer, take longer to dry, and can be more difficult to clean,” a press release said.
 “Soaking equipment in hot water containing dishwashing detergent (2 cups of detergent for every 2.5 gallons of water) for 20 minutes or more also will kill didymo. If hot water is not available, a commercial hot-water car wash also makes a good location to wash boats, motors, and trailers. At the other end of the temperature range, freezing items solid for at least 24 hours is effective. If cleaning, drying, or freezing is not practical, please restrict the equipment’s use to a single waterway.”
 Since 2007 didymo has been detected in the Delaware River, Dyberry Creek, the Youghiogheny River and Pine Creek.

The scoring standard of 2020 was very strict, for instance, the module is placed in an environmental chamber with temperature ranging between -40°C and 85°C with maximum power current applied, and is subject to 600 cycles. The test also simulates the case of extreme temperature variation that happens during the operation. Passing the test means the module can handle temperature cycles with performance intact. In addition, PID procedure is provided. With the module in an environmental chamber, voltage bias equal to the maximum system voltage rating of the module (-1000 V or -1500 V) is applied under 85°C and 85% relative humidity for cycles of 96 hours. These temperature, moisture, and voltage bias conditions can evaluate the degradation of the module. On account of high reliability, Suntech mono PERC modules' degradation less than 2%, and were listed as Top Performer.

Proper planting technique is important whatever time of year you are planting. This means, ideally, doing a soil sample to determine if your soil needs lime to raise the pH. Our naturally acidic soils are great for azaleas, rhododendrons, camellias, and blueberries - no lime is typically needed with these plants. However, your soil report will tell you other things about your soil which will benefit those plants as well, such as recommended phosphorus and potassium fertilizer. When you're digging the hole for your tree or shrub, wider is better, but not so deeper. The hole should be two or three times wider than the plant container, to allow for optimum root establishment. When backfilling the hole, add some good quality compost or other soil conditioner, mixing it with the soil and watering it in to ensure there are no air pockets. Some gardeners want to baby their plants by using exclusively compost or potting media in the planting hole. As with our children, we don't want to baby them too much, or they will be unprepared to deal with the "real world" - plant roots must be tough enough to make their way in the native soil at some point. The top of the plant root ball should be level with the grade of the soil around it; add no more than two inches of mulch to the top of the root ball,

"This is the third time that Suntech is included in the top performer list over the past 3 years since Suntech won the honor in 2018. It's not only a high affirmation of Suntech reliability, but also the greatest recognition of Suntech quality," said Mr. Vincent Cao, Vice President of Suntech. The outstanding performance of the mono PERC half-cell module is a result of Suntech strict management of raw materials, advanced production technology, and commitment to quality control that each module must go through 52 inspection steps. Industry-leading EL testing equipment has been adopted for two rounds of 100% full EL inspection for each module, thus guaranteeing each module is reliable in quality, conversion efficiency, and durable in service to the maximum extent via the most stringent quality inspection. It is such rigor control of quality that makes Suntech confident enough to promise for 12-year quality warranty and 25-year linear performance warranty, or even 30-year linear performance warranty for bifacial modules, which leads the industry.

The chocolate and vanilla on the palate – enhanced by 20 months spent in small French oak barrels – work well with the dark fruit flavours and there are also chewy but well-integrated tannins to handle the venison.

Williams set the tone for the game on the first play as he took the handoff straight up the middle and ran 79 yards untouched to the end zone to give the Raiders an 7-0 less than 30 seconds into the game.
 Williams rushed for 135 yards to go along with his two touchdowns.
 Jah Welch’s 6-yard run cut the lead to 7-6 midway through the first quarter, but the missed point-after prevented the Mustangs from tying the game.
 East Paulding had no answer for Kennesaw Mountain’s up-tempo running attack in the first half, as the Mustangs rushed for 124 of their 196 yards in the first half. Jenkins rushed for 96 yards.
 After it appeared Kennesaw Mountain let a golden scoring opportunity slip through its fingers when it got denied on fourth-and-2 on the East Paulding 4, Xavier Callender gave the Mustangs new life, recovering a fumble at the Raiders' 5.
 Kennesaw Mountain took advantage as Hall scored on a quarterback draw two plays later. The Mustangs took their first lead of the game at 13-7 early in the second quarter.
 Kennesaw Mountain forced five turnovers as its opportunistic defense gave the Mustangs every chance to win.
 “Our defense played lights out,” Carmean said. “They had a bunch of turnovers, pick-six. When you have that type of stuff, you've got to capitalize on it from an offensive perspective.”

 All of a sudden it was 24-16 with plenty of time left in the third quarter.

"We did a lot of good things and (it helps) when in you're opening game, momentum goes your way," veteran Independence head coach John H. Lilly said. "Everything that could have went good, went good for us and everything that could have went bad, went bad for them. (PikeView) is a much better football team and we know that. Tonight was kind of a reward for our guys, they worked hard in the summer."
 Independence wasted no time setting the tone for the game.
 The first Patriots possession started at the PikeView 45-yard line. Goodson promptly took the handoff and ran around, through and past the Panther defenders on what appeared to be an easy jaunt to paydirt.
 "I think that score right off the bat really gave us momentum and we just piggy-backed the rest of the half," Lilly said.
 Facing an uphill battle, PikeView did little to help itself along the way. Two plays into their first series, the Panthers fumbled deep in their own territory and Brady Grimmett dove on the ball for Indy.
 Goodson again took the handoff and plowed over defenders to reach the end zone for a 16-yard touchdown.
 A turnover on downs ended the next PikeView drive. The Patriots wasted no time showing they have other weapons besides Goodson to keep teams honest.
 On second-and-10 from the PikeView 39-yard line, senior quarterback Isaiah Duncan dropped back and hit sophomore Judah Price in perfect stride for the third Patriots touchdown just halfway through the first period.
 "We have three guys at wideout that haven't played before," Lilly explained. "We have Cyrus (Goodson), Atticus' brother, and (Trey) Bowers, a really good athlete who is only a ninth-grader, and of course, Judah. He has put on 20 pounds and he is one of the hardest working kids I have ever had."
 Price set the Patriots up for another quick score when he picked off a pass on the next series, but Indy's only mistake of the night, a Goodson fumble fighting for extra yards, stopped that drive.
 Goodson had scored on the previous play before a holding penalty erased the touchdown.
 Pinned deep in its own end, PikeView could not move the ball and was forced to punt. Price scored for the second time in the game when he exploded on a 52-yard touchdown run with 3:14 left in the opening quarter.
 PikeView's only real threat to score in the first half came on the next series when Tyler Meadows hit Dylan Blake racing down the seam inside the Patriots' 20-yard line. However, Goodson stripped Blake on the tackle and Indy recovered the ball to end the quarter.
 Starting from the Indy 9-yard line, Goodson broke free on the outside for a 73-yard gain to put his team in prime scoring position again.
 Two plays later, senior Cohen Miller found the end zone on a 10-yard run for a 35-0 lead.
 Before end of the half, Duncan connected with Bowers on a 42-yard touchdown pass, Goodson scored twice more (20, 9) and Indy tackled the PikeView punter in the end zone for a safety.
 "I was really proud of our quarterback. It was his first start and he came out really poised and played really well. I thought he looked calm," Lilly said.
 With PikeView's offense still its own worst enemy in the second half with fumbles and interceptions, Indy scored twice more on a 35-yard Tyler Linkwiler run and a 1-yard plunge from Logan Phalin.
 "We are a really young football team and, looking on the field, we made a lot of mistakes that we need to correct, but I give PikeView credit, they could have quit," Lilly said. "They came out in the second half and their guys fought through. I have been on both sides of that (outcome) and I respect them for coming out and fighting."
 One big advantage for Independence Friday night, was its ability to use its speed on the turf field installed over the summer. Had it been last year's field, the game could have been totally different, according to Lilly.
 "Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday there was nothing but rain here. I don't think we could have played this game," Lilly said. "I think we would have had to move it because the field would have been under water. We are really thankful to the Raleigh County Board of Education for getting this field for us. There were a lot of good things that happened tonight and hopefully we can continue the momentum next week."

 # The view from the rear
 By Kesley Colbert
 Contributing Writer
 The first day of practice in the seventh grade Coach Rogers told us that “football mirrored life.” We then spent the next week doing side straddle hops, bear crawls, monkey rolls and tackling drills. We beat on each other till our arms were black and blue. We ran so much our tongues dragged along the ground behind us…..
 As we were limping off the field about dark-thirty at the end of the week Buddy Wiggleton was the first to find his voice, “Guys, Coach is feeding us a line—this football stuff ain’t nothing like real life!”
 Coach Scott agreed one hundred per cent with Coach Rogers when we reached high school, “Men, football will prepare you for life. The principles of hard work, fair play and respect for your teammates will be with you forever.” He emphasized his words by running us around that little space between the back of the bleachers and the tennis courts till I died four times in one afternoon.
 Coach Majors looked the freshmen class over at our first practice at the University of the South and decried, “Young mens (Coach had his own special language), I can tell you your problem, your mother has always cut your meat for you (meaning of course, that we were spoiled, selfish, worthless, childish and thought too highly of ourselves). Don’t you mens worry, we are going to run that out of you this morning!”
 At my very first day of practice as a young assistant football coach in 1969, I didn’t say a word. I didn’t know enough to speak. But you would be amazed at what I discovered over the next six decades…..
 It didn’t take long to realize every child on the field had self-worth. Every player had specific needs, wants, hurts, desires and dreams. If you couldn’t see and understand them as individuals…..you were in the wrong line of work.
 And you cannot believe what those young football players taught me about RESPECT over the years!
 It started my very first season. Integration was just coming to the Gulf County educational system. I saw some serious black and white confrontations in the school. I didn’t see any on the football field.
 Let me tell you something, when you get kids up at 5:30 in the morning for gut drills during two-a-day practices, run them, work them, yell at them, send them through the chutes, make them run-the-lines, tackle each other, do up- downs till their little legs begin to quiver….. And then come back that afternoon and do it all over again.
 The color of somebody’s skin is the least of their worries.
 Listen, if you SURVIVED fall practice, respect was a given in that locker room! It had been earned ten times over!
 I coached the offensive line. I’d stand behind the chutes (iron bars with openings for linemen to practice coming low and hard off the line of scrimmage) looking at seven big rear ends in those look-a-like practice pants as they hunkered down in the best stance they had.
 From my perspective I couldn’t tell if they were black or white. I didn’t know if they were rich or poor. I couldn’t tell if they were sophomores or seniors. I didn’t know the all-American from the first timer.
 And I didn’t care. All that mattered was when I said “down-set-HUT” they’d better leap out of that chute like a whirlwind in a hurricane!
 I’ve seen scared, timid seventh and eighth graders grow into the bravest people you will ever know. I’ve seen proud players humbled. I’ve seen the quiet, insecure child burst out of his shell. I’ve seen selfless, courageous acts become common place.
 And teamwork become paramount above almost life itself!
 You cannot imagine how I’ve seen teams prepare the week of a big game. They laid it all out, pushed themselves, gave all they had….and then played the game exactly the same way. The coach didn’t matter. The weather didn’t matter. Extraneous things like individual backgrounds, what happened the week before last or who your favorite cartoon character was didn’t matter.
 The team mattered. You cared more about the success of a friend than your own. It was about the good of all!
 I’ve seen “our guys” win those big games with great humility and empathy for the opponent. I’ve seen tough loses….heart wrenching loses…..where our guys met the winners on the fifty yard line with a handshake and a sincere congratulations.
 I’ve seen common sense, knowledge and maturity grow with each drill, each scrimmage and each game. It’s unbelievable how easy the love comes when you really get to know each other…..
 As I look at the world, and especially the United States, in the late summer of 2020, I agree with Buddy Wiggleton. Real life as we know it today…..ain’t nothing like football at all!
 Regretfully,
 Kes

Sarah Rees, AA Driving School managing director said: “Many people will have missed the freedom of taking their car out for a drive during lockdown and staycations were certainly popular this summer, so maybe it’s a great time to think about future road trips.

MERIDIAN — Kobe Warr never let the moment get to him.
 After helping Rocky Mountain to a big lead early in the game, the Grizzlies’ quarterback saw Mountain View cut the lead to a one-possession game multiple times. But every time his team needed him, the senior came through with a scoring drive.
 Warr accounted for three touchdowns, two through the air and one on the ground, as Rocky Mountain survived a second-half comeback attempt from the Mavericks to take a 39-36 win in their season opener at Mountain View High.
 “It gives us confidence and shows what we have to work on a lot,” said Warr. “There were a lot of little things that we missed, that once we get rid of I think we should be pretty good.”
 The Grizzlies took home the Battle of the Mountains trophy for the third straight year and opened the season with a victory in a showdown between two of the 5A Southern Idaho Conference’s top two teams. It was a game that wasn’t officially on the book until Tuesday, when the West Ada School District approved a return to play plan while Central District Health had the school district still in the red. With the COVID-19 pandemic keeping the district in the red, no fans were allowed in the stands.
 “Anytime you play a good competitor like that it’s awesome, whether it’s a trophy game or not,” Rocky Mountain coach Chris Culig said. “It’s tough that first game, because there’s so much stuff. In the summer we usually have 7-on-7’s and (Boise State) camp, so you usually have a feel for the personnel.”
 Despite all unusual nature of the game, Rocky Mountain got off to a fast start, scoring the game’s first 24 points.
 After Justin Douglas recovered a fumble by Maverick quarterback Jake Farris, Warr scrambled on fourth-and-3 to score on a 16-yard run. Max Lehman made it 16-0 late in the first quarter, scoring on a two-yard run then catching a two- point conversion throw from Warr.
 After neither team scored in the second quarter, Jordan Erickson opened the third with a 95-yard kickoff return for a touchdown, opening up a 24-0 lead.
 But that was not a comfortable enough lead as Farris and wide receiver Kayden Chan started getting the Maverick offense moving.
