When the Minnesota State High School League voted Aug. 4 to allow cross- country, girls tennis, girls swimming and diving, and boys and girls soccer to move forward this fall it left many cross-country coaches wondering what the season will look like.
 The MSHSL said there will be a 20 percent reduction in the season schedule and a 30 percent reduction in competitions. Cross-country meets will be limited to three teams and practice can begin Aug. 17. The first date allowed for competition is Aug. 24.
 The Waterville-Elysian-Morristown/Janesville-Waldorf-Pemberton cross-country teams typically host a meet annually in Janesville but for programs that don’t host a meet, finding meets will become trickier as other schools try to line up meets on the fly.
 “I think that’s probably going to be the biggest change,” JWP Activities Director Ryan Luedtke said. “Most of the meets we go to there are seven or eight teams.”
 For schools who host meets, adding additional home meets isn’t as easy as waving a magic wand, either. Schools need cooperation from golf courses usually and schools pay a fee to the golf courses to run there. Adding meets at this time of the year might not fit in the schedule for golf courses.
 The Gopher Conference will hold seven meets this season, including a conference meet. Each school will host two meets, Luedtke said. The conference meet will include all schools, though the meet will have staggered start time, Luedtke said.
 School districts across the state face the issue of transportation, not only for athletics, but for schooling, depending upon which back-to-school model districts decide to use. As it is, districts are using a 50 percent capacity model for busing, which doesn’t impact area cross-country teams as much as it does in other areas.
 WEM/JWP had 38 students participate in cross-country last season and at a 50 percent capacity for busing, that means it can transport 35 students on a bus. With the team spread across two districts, busing isn’t as big of an issue. Waseca had 35 students on its teams last season and fits within the 50 percent recommendation.
 The shortened season will mean a reduction in meets for WEM/JWP. The program typically runs nine meets a year. In a usual season, teams can participate in 10 meets a year.
 The reduction in meets and transportation considerations will likely mean a conference heavy schedule for teams. That can be easy for conferences that have schools within close proximity. But for Waseca, a member of the Big South Conference, that might prove tougher.
 “I don’t know how well that is going to work because our conference is so big,” Waseca cross-country head coach Grant Popp said. “We’ll just kind of see how that shakes out. We’d like to try to schedule some things with closer schools. We’re just up in the air still.”
 Once the MSHSL revealed its decision, talk on social media quickly sprung up on students having the opportunity to become four-sport athletes. With volleyball and football still allowed to practice in the fall, area cross- country coaches aren’t planning on a spike in participation numbers, though they’d welcome additional athletes.
 “I would encourage students to do that if that’s something they’re interested in,” New Richland-Hartland-Ellendale-Geneva cross-country head coach Miles Otsot said. “I’m hoping we’d get a few more.”

 The University of Minnesota Crookston recently received a $100,000, one-year grant from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development (RD) agency to fund the Mano Amiga program of the Veden Center for Rural Economic Development.
 The Veden Center works to increase employment and entrepreneurship opportunities among the growing Latino community in Crookston and Polk County areas surrounding the university. UMN Crookston officials said the university plans to expand the Mano Amiga program into additional geographic areas as the project takes root and grows.
 UMN Crookston is a pioneer in utilizing resources of the state's large university system to benefit marginalized Minnesota communities in a culturally relevant manner.
 The Veden Center will advance skills in the Latino community in multiple ways. First, critical education in business and entrepreneurship will be translated into Spanish and offered in certificate programs focused on building regional skills as well entrepreneurship and small business development skills. A goal is to increase retention and completion of course work by delivering it in participating students' native language. At the same time, programming seeks to improve students' use of English in a business setting. UMN Crookston intends to eventually create credit-based programs that lead to a baccalaureate degree.

2Q 2020 Results Were Above Expectations
 Indosat reported 2Q 2020 financial results on July 29, 2020, and the company's financial performance exceeded market expectations. Indosat's revenue increased by +6% QoQ and +11% YoY to IDR6,929 billion in 2Q 2020, while the company's 2Q 2020 EBITDA of IDR3,050 billion represented QoQ and YoY growth rates of +28% and +34%, respectively. Indosat also registered a net profit attributable to shareholders of IDR265 billion in the most recent quarter, compared with a net loss of -IDR606 billion in 1Q 2020.
 The company's core mobile business, which accounted for 83% of its 1H 2020 top line, saw segment revenue grow +7% QoQ and +12% YoY to IDR5,769 billion in 2Q 2020. The strong growth in data revenue helped to more than offset the decline in legacy revenue (e.g. voice, short message service etc.) for Indosat's mobile segment.
 Indosat's data revenue grew +13% QoQ and +29% YoY to IDR4,945 billion in the most recent quarter, while its legacy revenue witnessed a -12% QoQ and -38% YoY drop to IDR567 billion over the same period. The mobile business delivered robust data revenue growth on the back of a +59% YoY and +18% QoQ increase in data traffic to 1.2 petabytes, despite the fact that data yield declined -19% YoY and -5% QoQ to IDR4.1 per MB. Indosat's mobile business also earns revenue from other sources such as tower leasing and other value-added services.
 Indosat's EBITDA margin improved significantly from 36.4% in 2Q 2019 and 36.5% in 1Q 2020 to 44.0% in 2Q 2020. This was primarily driven by labor cost savings, with the company "laying off 677 employees" as part of "organization rightsizing" plans initiated earlier in the year, as reported by Indonesian media _The Jakarta Post_.
 In terms of operating metrics, Indosat's subscribers increased by +2% QoQ and +1% YoY to approximately 57.2 million in 2Q 2020, while its blended ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) rose +12% QoQ and +13% YoY to IDR33,200 in the most recent quarter. Apart from an increase in the number of 4G mobile subscribers, Indosat's strategy change with respect to its product offerings was also a significant contributor to the company's higher APRU in 2Q 2020.

 Do you know what your ceiling looks like on sleepless nights? I'm betting you do. Wide-eyed for hours. Anxious. Numb. Searching. Clawing for resolution to another real-life nightmare.
 I'm not talking small stuff here. Not the latest skirmish at work. Not some science project needing attention. But you knew that. You're already going where you keep your private stock of worries. My private stock? Well, I'll share three.
 For a teenager, a mom who wouldn't be making it through seven years of radical surgeries, radiation, and chemo. Later, a brother-in-law with the same breast cancer succumbing early to a bout of infection. For decades, a son's battle against lethal immune deficiency. I'll leave it there because I know your worries have been, and still are, at least as compelling as mine.
 You don't need me telling you what forms the shadows take on your ceiling. Yet, I wonder. Is it possible our tortured night visions are converging? For starters, weakened immune systems stemming from innate biochemistry or exposure to invasive agents are endured by 10 million-plus Americans. Joining them in vulnerability to pathogens are folks with heart disease, lung disease, or diabetes, their numbers burgeoning to 120 million, 37 million, and 35 million, respectively.
 Pre-existing conditions abound. Over half of the adults you and I know, along with many children, have one or more of these vulnerabilities.
 Since COVID-19 hit, we've been sleepless far more then we should be. And we know why. Here we are, living in the country that has been the greatest juggernaut for scientific achievement and future promise the world has ever known, yet our federal government has responded like a lower tier third-world country. Yes, a man who shares none of our empathy or desire to help others has stuck a crooked stick in the whirring spokes of the great American juggernaut, choosing self-aggrandizement, criminality, and runaway ignorance over you, me, and everything we hold dear -- everything our ancestors worked, fought, and died for. Our toil. Our children's dreams. Everything!
 Choosing pursuit of raw power over even minimally competent governance, this charlatan has already personally accounted for needless deaths. For months, deceiving his ardent followers into rejecting masks, he has endangered them and us. Giving the boldface lie to hollow claims of patriotism, he has falsely declared it a right to rain death upon fellow citizens -- a few droplets at a time.
 Supporting the well-being of all citizens, sacrificing when necessary, is the hallmark of true patriotism. The careless shredding of America's social contract by the serrated edge of claims to rights devoid of responsibility is anything but.
 In Edgar Allan Poe's epic short story, The Masque of the Red Death, the arrogant and dismissive Prince Prospero convinces his courtiers to join him for a night of revelry during a virulent plague, assuring them they have nothing to fear.
 But their unease grows as a towering ebony clock chimes on toward midnight. At the last stroke of 12, the mask is stripped from a ghoulish stranger, revealing nothing more than an invisible mist within its hollow robes. Thusly freed, the Red Death quickly seeps from room to room, leaving no reveler untouched. Sound familiar?
 Yet, COVID-19 is merely the overture to the first act of the looming climate catastrophe and poisoning of America Donald Trump is egging on. Do we continue staring at the ceiling? Most likely. But what else can we do? The words volunteer, donate, influence, and vote come to mind. If any one of us fails to act, Nov. 3, 2020 may strike midnight for the Great American Experiment.

Industrial activities showed improvement in June, but still remained in contraction zone.
 According to latest government data, the contraction has narrowed down to 16.6 per cent in June against indicative headline number of 33.89 per cent in May and 57.62 per cent in April.
 For the three months (April-June) period the rate is nearly 36 per cent.
 For the first time after March, the Statistics Ministry has come out with a headline number showing a contraction of nearly 20 per cent in mining, over 17 per cent in manufacturing and 10 per cent in electricity.
 These three sectors registered contraction of 22.4 per cent, 40.7 per cent and 15.8 per cent respectively in the April-June period.
 According to Aditi Nayar, Principal Economist at ICRA Ltd, the pace of contraction of various lead indicators, such as the output of Coal India Limited, electricity consumption and GST e-way bills narrowed to single-digits in July 2020, which suggests that the de-growth in the IIP would also shrink in that month.
 Nevertheless, we continue to caution that pent-up demand contributed to the improved performance of certain categories of manufacturing in June-July 2020, which may not sustain in August 2020 especially in light of the extension of localised lockdowns in various States
 Anil K Sood, Co-Founder of the Institute for Advanced Studies in Complex Choices, feels that the labour intensive manufacturing sectors like textiles and apparels, machinery, motor vehicles and transportation don’t show much sign of recovery — these sectors constitute nearly 15 per cent of the index weight and the production is below 60 per cent of level achieved during June last year.
 “A lack of growth in labour intensive sectors will have an adverse impact of demand going forward,” he said.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- A Louisville woman is accused of driving drunk when she drove into a pedestrian on a skateboard in the Portland neighborhood.
 According to an arrest report, the incident took place Monday night, at the intersection of West Market Street and South 30th Street, at the border of Louisville's Portland and Russell neighborhoods.
 Louisville Metro Police say officers were sent to the scene after someone reported an injury accident.
 Police say 53-year-old Kimberly Lucas was driving a 2013 GM Sierra when she hit a pedestrian on a skateboard. That pedestrian was taken to University Hospital with a serious injury. There is no word on his or her condition.
 According to the arrest report, Lucas admitted to drinking two beers before driving her vehicle. Police say her eyes were bloodshot, she smelled of alcohol and she blew a .126 on a preliminary breathalyzer test.
 Lucas was arrested and charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, operating on a suspended or revoked operator license, failure of a vehicle owner to maintain required insurance and first-degree assault.
 She is currently being held in Louisville Metro Corrections.

“I didn’t even have to say anything to them,” Dillman said. “They came running in and said, ‘Hey, it’s early. Two runs aren’t going to beat us.’”
 Bradd proved as much by taking the first pitch from Buckley’s Andy Davis and turning into into a triple, scoring a short time later on Champaign Central product Cole Jones’ sacrifice fly.
 Bradd then poked a broken-bat two-run single with two outs in the second inning as part of a four-run frame. From there, St. Joseph-Ogden alumnus Adam Crites and fellow relief pitcher Jesse Remington, a Rantoul graduate, shut the door on the Dutch Masters.
 “We brought a lot of fans, too, so it was a good atmosphere,” Bradd said. “The Buckley fans were pretty quiet all weekend because they didn’t have much to cheer for.”
 Bradd certainly did. In addition to helping Royal secure its second championship in three seasons, he also was part of a Normal CornBelters team that on Sunday won the Kernels Collegiate League title — though Bradd didn’t turn around to play in Normal during that season’s last day.

A new long term plan for living with the Covid-19 virus over the next nine months is being drafted by the Government, Taoiseach Micheál Martin has revealed. Speaking after a Cabinet sub committee on Covid-19, Mr Martin said the plan is aimed at finding a way of keeping society opening while dealing with spikes in coronavirus cases.&ldquo;The Cabinet committee will meet again next week with a view to having an initial discussion on the medium term plan to take us through Covid for the next six months to nine months of planning for the next phase of living with Covid-19,&rdquo; the Taoiseach said.&ldquo;We've opened up to a considerable degree our economy and our society. Obviously, like other countries, there's been an increase in numbers so we&rsquo;ve got to look and plan ahead in terms of potential scenarios that might emerge but also how we maintain that level of economic activity,&rdquo; he added.It was also agreed that the Government will announce new financial supports before the end of the week for business impacted by the localised lockdowns in the Kildare, Offaly and Laois.The Taoiseach said Tánaiste Leo Varadkar, Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe and Public Expenditure Minister Micheal McGrath will draft supports for businesses impacted by the midlands lockdown.Mr Martin said he is concerned about the spike in case in the Midlands and the overall increase in new case across the country. However, he said Acting Chief Medical Officer Ronan Glynn said community transmission of the virus remains stable.The Taoiseach said ministers also signed off a new testing regime for meat processing factories, direct provision centres and nursing homes.There will also be systematic testing of workers in meat process factories every week to begin with and then every fortnight. A similar testing regime will be introduced for Direct Provision centres and other congregated settings. Weekly testing of staff in nursing homes will also resume over fears the virus could lead to more tragedy among older people.&ldquo;We have to stand back and look at the wider situation in terms of congregated settings and risks that they present and there will be discussions next week around that,&rdquo; Mr Martin said.&ldquo;We'll be looking at meat plants in general in terms of occupational health, in terms of making sure the workers are protected and that the conditions contained within those factories are assessed in terms of their capacity to be conducive to the spread of the virus,&rdquo; he added.

The Scottish Premiership is in disarray after breaches of safety protocol, but there are three games on Wednesday. Here are the biggest talking points ahead of the latest fixtures.The Scottish government have told the SPFL that they are on their last warning after Celtic were the latest club to breach Covid-19 safety protocols. The champions&rsquo; game with St Mirren has been postponed after defender Boli Bolingoli secretly visited Spain last week and did not quarantine on his return. Aberdeen&rsquo;s match at home at Hamilton has also been called off after eight players broke protocols with a night out last week. First minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned the SPFL that this is a &ldquo;yellow card&rdquo; for them and any more breaches could see the entire league suspended.Celtic&rsquo;s inactivity could see Rangers open up a five-point lead over their rivals. Steven Gerrard&rsquo;s men have hit the ground running, winning their opening two fixtures against Aberdeen and St Mirren and they have the chance to win three league games in a row for the first time since January when St Johnstone visit. Going so far in front of the Hoops – even at this early stage of the season – would see the Gers being chased instead of chasing, as has been the case in recent years.Motherwell are looking for their first points and goals of the season but they have selection issues at left-back. The Well have been beaten 1-0 in both of their opening two games. Boss Stephen Robinson is &lsquo;cursing&rsquo; his left-back options, though, after Liam Donnelly was ruled out for two months with a knee injury – the third player to suffer problems in that position already this season. Robinson will now head to the transfer market but he will not bring anyone in in time for the game with Ross County.Ross County have made the most of their reprieve from relegation last season and have won their opening two games. That puts them up as early front runners along with Hibs and Rangers. And if they can beat Kilmarnock at home then they will register three league wins in a row for the first time since 2015.

Primarily, there is a persistent worry that a critical opportunity for achieving racial justice in Portland’s tiny Black community could be lost. Many cite competing voices and the harsh glare of a national spotlight, which has reduced the situation to a culture war when the reality is much more complex.
 “It happens so much that the things that we care about get hijacked and get put on the back burner. And that just gets put into a big barrel with everything else,” said Neil Anderson, a Black business owner. “We all want the same thing. But so often we get drowned out.”
 The city’s Black Lives Matter protests rocketed into the national consciousness in mid-July, when President Donald Trump sent agents from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to protect a federal courthouse that had increasingly become a target of protesters.
 The action galvanized the city and united demonstrators, but it also exposed a simmering tension between Black demonstrators and their white allies, as well as disagreements among Black residents themselves about the way forward.
 The Wall of Moms, a group of mostly white women and self-described parents, gathered nightly to form a human chain between protesters and federal agents. Within two weeks, the group had imploded, with some Black community leaders accusing its leadership of trying to monetize their movement. The group reformed under Black leadership and a new name.
 Demetria Hester, a Black woman who leads the new Moms United for Black Lives, said the departure of federal agents and the dissolution of the Wall of Moms has refocused the protests.
 “These are the moms who actually want to ... make our reparations happen. Make this revolution happen,” she said.
 Seneca Cayson, who helped lead peaceful gatherings in downtown Portland, has mixed feelings. He feels white protesters who commit vandalism and taunt law enforcement are distracting from his message, but he also recognizes they are drawing attention to racial injustice in a way he could never do.
 “What the white people have is something that we don’t, and that’s rights,” said Cayson, as he prepared to lead another peaceful rally with several other Black men. “We are fighting alongside them to ... be equal.”
 The Portland Police Bureau, with its newly appointed Black police chief, is for many Black residents just as polarizing as the protests.
 For many, part of breaking down racial barriers means defunding the police entirely. The city population is less than 6% Black but people of color were disproportionately stopped by the gun violence reduction team. An analysis of police use of force published last month found that in 2019, officers were much more likely to use force against Black people — and particularly young Black men — than other groups despite overall trends towards less use of force.
 “It is the entire culture of the Portland Police Bureau that is fundamentally unmanageable and must change,” said Jo Ann Hardesty, the city’s first Black councilwoman and an activist who has pressed for police reform for 30 years. “Thirty years is a long time to be asking for the exact same reforms. The difference now is there are tens of thousands of Portlanders who want the exact same thing.”
 In June, the City Council cut nearly $16 million from the Police Bureau budget. The cuts shuttered programs like the gun violence reduction unit, a youth services program and ended the presence of school resource officers in three school districts.
 In July, the city experienced a sharp rise in gun violence that has overwhelmingly hurt Black people. There were 99 shootings — more than triple the amount from the previous July — and the city has tallied 366 non-suicide shootings this year compared to 388 in all of 2019. Roughly two-thirds of the victims in July were Black, said police Sgt. Derrick Foxworth.
 Kimberly Dixon, who lost her son to gun violence in 2013, said the dissolution of the gun violence reduction team has hurt the Black community. Mayor Ted Wheeler said he is working on a solution that will be made public soon.
 “You took away the expertise that was there, the relationships that were there,” Dixon said. “That connectivity is important, historical context is important. When you disbanded it, did you rebuild? ... This is the carnage that is left in the community.”
 Some Black residents, however, say they can’t imagine racial justice in their city without doing away with the police. Vandalism, and even violence, during protests to elevate Black grievances after hundreds of years of oppression is appropriate, they say.
 Teressa Raiford, head of Don’t Shoot Portland and a former mayoral candidate, said people who are questioning the legitimacy of protest through so-called “direct action” against police are on “the wrong side of history.”
 “There are people that are hellbent on protecting the status quo and the system as the way it is even if the outcomes don’t serve us,” she said. “The politicizing of Black people is not only vicious, it’s violent and we’re not being heard.”
 Raiford said: “The disgusting people, in my opinion, are the people with guns and tasers that are attacking people that are showing up to protests. When we talk about anarchy ... you know that we have stolen people that were brought to stolen land where they were used as slaves. And I think people are realizing that — including white people.”

 In light of the recent remarks made by the president of Neshaminy School Board, I want the members of the Middletown and Neshaminy communities to know that as a proud Neshaminy graduate and a Middletown supervisor, I denounce and condemn his remarks.
 Growing up with a rare disease, my life was much different than most of my friends. I experienced things that many other kids never thought about. Many people don't understand the seemingly invisible barriers that many still face in our society today. In a way, my life has prepared me to be more understanding of different life experiences. At this time more so than ever, it is crucial to understand that the world is bigger than what happens at our front door.
 For me, it's simple. I recognize that systemic racism is a problem throughout this country and I'm committed to doing my part to make our community more inclusive. I affirm that black lives matter. This is not a political issue; this is a human rights issue, and human rights are non-negotiable.
 It is about treating others with decency and respect, regardless of their race. When the Neshaminy School Board president denounced the organization and then claimed to support the movement that sends a mixed message, and it is tone deaf. This is not a time to get caught up in semantics. These comments were offensive, callous, and dangerous.
 As an elected official, you are elected to represent all members of the community and you are expected to treat everyone with respect and decency. There are no two sides to this issue. And our school board is entrusted with the development of children in our community. The weight of this responsibility demands one be held to a higher standard. It is our role to make our schools an environment that all feel welcomed, safe, and secure. To anyone who feels marginalized, frustrated, or angry, know that I'm here for you. I've got your back.
 On July 20 the Middletown Township Board of Supervisors began the work to pass an anti-discrimination ordinance and create a Human Relations Council. I encourage everyone to virtually share their thoughts at our hearing scheduled for Aug. 24. My goal in proposing this to my fellow supervisors was simple: make our community more equitable and accessible for all. To me, that doesn't feel political. It just feels right. Our community should help lead the way in combating injustice wherever it presents itself. Again, that should not be a political statement.
 As a Middletown supervisor, Neshaminy graduate, local resident, and human being, I encourage the Neshaminy School Board to pass an anti-discrimination ordinance to ensure all students feel welcomed, regardless of their race, gender, sexual orientation, or ability.
  _Anna Payne is a Middletown Township Supervisor and Neshaminy High School graduate._

Ljubisa Markovic, totem serbo dell’Italiangas Air Termoli, è pronto a tuffarsi con grande determinazione nell’avventura a Termoli e lo lascia intendere a chiare lettere anche dalle sue prime dichiarazioni.
 «Sono felice perché c’è l’opportunità di giocare dopo la lunga sosta a causa della pandemia. Sono stati cinque mesi senza pallacanestro ed è stato un periodo lunghissimo. Ora c’è questa opportunità legata a Termoli e mi auguro di riuscire a dar vita ad una buona stagione».
 Due i riferimenti ideali di Markovic. «Ho sempre ammirato Divac e, in questo momento, Jokic».
 Dettagli che proiettati su se stesso trovano però la ritrosia dello stesso plavo. «Potrei enunciare le mie caratteristiche, ma credo sia più giusto che siano gli altri a parlare di me. Comunque, se proprio devo rispondere alla domanda, sono un giocatore da post basso ma non solo, cerco di fare al meglio il mio lavoro ed ho la possibilità di giocare indifferentemente sia da quattro che da cinque. Ho doti di passatore e, in difesa, mi piace anche farmi sentire a livello di stoppate, tant’è che, nelle ultime tre stagioni, ho viaggiato a ritmi di una stoppata e mezza di media a partita. Però, ripeto, saranno gli altri a giudicare il mio operato, non spetta certo a me».
 Forte di un’esperienza che, tra l’altro, oltre che in Serbia l’ha portato in giro per l’Europa tra Slovenia e Germania, prima dell’Italia, Markovic parla del torneo italiano come «di un campionato di livello superiore a quello tedesco per quanto esprime anche coi suoi elementi, ma dietro Serbia e Slovenia».
 Sui perché, invece, delle qualità dei giocatori plavi il pensiero del pivot dei termolesi è ben definito. «Per noi la pallacanestro è più di un lavoro e quindi non è soltato una fonte di entrata economica, è una ragione di vita. Ci piace stare in palestra e lavorare sodo, soffermandoci sull’aspetto dei fondamentali individuali anche al di fuori dell’orario di allenamento. Sono dettagli che, magari, per molti possono sembrare particolari, ma che per noi rappresentano l’assoluta normalità».

Lebanon is marking a week since a massive explosion in Beirut flattened much of its capital’s port, damaged buildings and left thousands of people dead and injured. Several events, including a moment of silence at 6.08pm local time, when the blast happened, are planned to commemorate the explosion.It was caused by the ignition of 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate that had been sitting at the Beirut port for more than six years. A candlelight vigil is also planned. The explosion has fuelled popular outrage against the country&rsquo;s top political leaders and security agencies, and led to the resignation of the government.In the wake of the disaster, documents have come to light that show that top Lebanese officials knew about the existence of the stockpile in the heart of Beirut near residential areas, and did nothing about it.It still was not clear what caused the fire in a port warehouse that triggered the explosion of the chemicals, which created a shockwave so powerful it was felt as far away as the island of Cyprus more than 180 miles across the Mediterranean.&ldquo;From one minute to the next, the world changed for people in Beirut,&rdquo; said Basma Tabaja, deputy head of the International Committee of the Red Cross&rsquo;s delegation in Lebanon.The explosion, which obliterated the capital&rsquo;s port, damaged thousands of homes and offices in the capital and came on top of an unprecedented economic and financial crisis the country the country has been mired in since late last year, compounding the nation&rsquo;s collective distress. Meanwhile, behind the scenes contacts are under way for the formation of a new government, a day after Prime Minister Hassan Diab resigned. Mr Diab&rsquo;s government, which was supported by the militant group Hezbollah and its allies, unravelled after the deadly blast, with three ministers announcing they were quitting.Mr Diab&rsquo;s government was formed after his predecessor, Saad Hariri, stepped down in October in response to anti-government demonstrations over endemic corruption. It took months of bickering among the leadership factions before they settled on Mr Diab.Lebanese have demanded an independent cabinet not backed by any of the political political parties they blame for the mess they are in. Many are also calling for an independent investigation into the port explosion, saying they had zero trust in a local probe.Lebanese officials have rejected an international investigation. The government, in the last decision it made before resigning, referred the case to the Supreme Judicial Council, Lebanon&rsquo;s top judicial body, which handles crimes infringing on Lebanon&rsquo;s national security as well as political and state security crimes.

Wave starts actually happen at many big meets — spreading out athletes by academic grade or past performance.
 Meets in general might just be smaller this year because of the IHSA guideline that teams should “limit meet entries to the maximum number of competitors to represent a team in a cross-country race (seven runners) plus one alternate runner per race.”
 That said, the wave format is a workaround for this issue as well.
 Finish chutes also shouldn’t be as crowded, with the IHSA recommendations of corrals and avoiding lineups to record athletes’ time and placement.
 Kids who tend to fall after a race and fear being trampled should love that guidance.

When Hertz filed for bankruptcy in May, its stock value was set to be wiped out even though the company hopes to stay in business. But investors -- primarily day traders -- drove up the value of the stock more than 1,000% in the weeks that followed.
 That led Hertz to announce plans to sell up to $500 million of additional shares to raise the cash it needed to see it through the bankruptcy process. A bankruptcy judge approved the plan for the stock sale, but the SEC then said it was looking into the situation.
 But late Monday, Hertz disclosed for the first time that it had sold 13.9 million shares for more than $2 each before the SEC took action. That raised $29 million.

Here in the United States the virus particularly vicious, as we watch in horror as it become crystal clear it’s not going anywhere for the foreseeable future.

Thanks a lot and good morning. My first question is just making sure I understand some of the trends in business restoring [ph]. You mentioned that you started more aggressively spending on advertising. I presume that's direct response advertising, but it doesn't seem like you've got a commensurate improvement in sales growth rates. Can you correct me if I'm wrong? ?

Saudi Aramco CEO has said that the mega deal for the companys 15 billion stake in the oil to chemicals business of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) is going through due diligence and a decision will be taken after a review. Amin Nasser, Saudi Aramco CEO, Saudi Arabian Oil Company commented on the status of the potential transaction with RIL in a post earnings call with analysts on Monday.  With regard to the Reliance deal, all I can say at this stage, its going through due diligence. So, depending on the due diligence, we will make our decision after we complete the due diligence on that deal, Aramco CEO said. This is a big deal. So we need to take our time to review and then decide based on the outcome of the due diligence study, Nasser added. Speaking at the companys annual general meeting in July, RIL Chairman, Mukesh Ambani had said the deal involving the worlds largest oil producer -- Aramco picking up a minority stake in refinery business of RILis on track as the two sides remain committed to a long term partnership. Speaking at the companys first virtual annual general meeting, Ambani said that due to unforeseen circumstances in the energy market, the deal (with Aramco) has not progressed as per original timeline. In the meanwhile, companys equity requirements have already been met. Nevertheless, we at Reliance value our over two-decade long relationship with Saudi Aramco and are committed to a long-term partnership, he said. The RIL and Aramco deal has been in the works for some time and doubts were raised on its early completion due to COVID-19 outbreak and lockdowns. The deal between Reliance and Aramco involves the Indian entity offering at least 20% stake in a special purpose vehicle covering refining, petrochemicals and marketing. RIL board has already approved hiving-off its 75 billion O2C business into a separate entity. Ambani announced that the company will spin off its oil-to-chemical business into a separate subsidiary by early 2021 after regulatory approvals, and detailed plans of also moving into green energy space.

There can be no disputing the argument that environment impact assessment (EIA) norms need to be revisited at least once in a decade, to readjust economic activities to the state of the environment. Hence, the Environment Impact Assessment Notification 2020 was drawn up in March, just before the first lockdown, with a view to replacing its existing avatar prepared in 2006. Yesterday was the last day for receiving public feedback on the draft. The new draft has been criticised for exempting a number of projects from public consultations; legalising projects which have come up without an environment clearance ‘ _ex post facto_ ’ by making them pay a fine; easing compliance norms for project proponents by making them submit just one compliance report annually instead of two at present; reducing the time window for public hearings; and not taking cognisance of public reporting of violations and non- compliance. Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar has refuted some of these allegations in a letter to the chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Environment and Forests, Jairam Ramesh. He has said that detailed consultations will precede any finalisation of the draft, while contesting the view that environmental rules are being given the go-by. Exemptions from public hearing for ‘B2 category projects’, he contends, are a feature of the 2006 draft as well. B2 projects, essentially Section 26 of the new draft, will be subject to a more relaxed process of appraisals. The areas include oil exploration, small hydel projects; broadly speaking MSMEs in the mining, minerals and chemicals sectors; small cement plants; inland waterway projects; expansion or widening of highways between 25 km and 100 km; aerial ropeways; and some construction projects. While the effort is consistent with the ongoing MSME push, promoting industrial activity without considering environmental impacts can push India into a deep environmental crisis, as China seems to have realised of late. The EIA draft, as the Minister has indicated, should be the outcome of a stakeholder consensus. Recent moves to pull down websites that raised questions on the draft were, however, regrettable.
 The perils of disregarding EIA are visible around us, in the floods and landslides in Uttarakhand, and in industrial zones such as Valsad, Singrauli and Korba, to name just a few. As Ramesh observes in his book _Green Signals_ : “As far as hydroelectric projects are concerned, we need to carry out cumulative impact assessments on a basin-basis and not just assessment of individual projects.” EIA norms need to be revisited — by adopting global best practices — with the realisation that the positive externalities of natural resources cannot be easily quantified.
 The exercise of discretionary power should be avoided to help bonafide businesses. Yet, the Centre should send out a clear signal that it will not brook environmental law breakers, even as it focuses on ease of doing business.

Foreign and domestic broking firms and analysts have taken a divergent view on the stock of Titan Company Ltd after the company’s rather dull first quarter numbers.
 While Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley remain negative on Titan, most analysts working for domestic broking firms remain positive on the stock.
 Shares of the company declined 5.3 per cent in early trade on Tuesday at ₹1,050.20 on the BSE, after the firm reported a consolidated net loss of ₹297 crore for the June quarter, impacted by lower income due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Total income declined 61.2 per cent to ₹2,020 crore (₹5,208 crore).
 The stock recovered partially to end at ₹1,066.50, down 3.73 per cent over the previous day's close.
 Goldman Sachs, which maintained a ‘Sell’ on the stock and a target price of ₹705, said discretionary purchases will remain under pressure. Similarly, Morgan Stanley too went ‘underweight’ on the stock with a target price of ₹807. “The Q1 earnings were weaker than consensus estimates and the macro and business headwinds will likely outweigh market share gain,” it said and added that full-fledged demand recovery will remain elusive in FY-2021.
 However, for domestic brokerages such as Motilal Oswal Financial, ICICI Securities, Emkay Global Financial and Sharekhan, it's either buy or hold.
 For Motilal, Titan is a buy with a target price of ₹1,300. Titan stands to gain from a favourable regulatory and operating environment for organised players and the ongoing travails of unorganised/organised peers in the Covid and post-Covid period, which will likely lead to accelerated shutdown of several players, it said.
 According to Emkay Global, recovery in jewellery retail sales has been very strong, similar to trends witnessed after previous disruptions, and may continue to surprise.
 Pent-up demand and pre-ponement of wedding demand have helped July sales. “While these may reverse, increasing normalcy will drive sequential improvement, in our view,”’ Emkay, which maintained a buy stance with a revised price target of ₹1,215 (earlier ₹1,100), said.
 TItan is ‘Hold' for ICICI Securities with a target price of ₹1,108. I-Sec believes consumers will start accepting the high gold price and that could support volumes over the rest of FY21. Secondly, the ₹600-crore one-off bullion sale (4 per cent of FY21 jewellery revenues) indicates the ‘lost sales’. The long-term formalisation and market share gains narrative remains. However, ‘introduction of fixed making charges, even though a small proportion currently, is something that we will watch carefully,’ it added.
 Sharekhan also retained its buy rating with a target price of ₹1,200, as it expects gain in market share, people shifting to a trusted brand and a relatively stable balance sheet.

When the coronavirus pandemic hit, music festivals and large-scale concerts were among the first events to be canceled because of concerns for public health.
 After months of online concerts and outdoor events, event organizers are beginning to test the waters by putting on small-scale concerts for audiences, following strict hygiene and social distancing measures.  
 Yet during this phase of cautious entry, one plan by concert promoter Marek Lieberberg is causing a stir. His company, Live Nation Germany, has announced the first major concert in Germany. It will be held at Merkur Arena in Düsseldorf and can accommodate 13,000 concertgoers for the big event on September 4. Tickets for the two-and-a-half-hour concert will go on sale August 11.
 The Düsseldorf arena is the third-largest stadium in Germany with 54,000 seats. This means the venue will be at 23% capacity under Lieberberg's plan. His concept includes strict social distancing and hygiene rules and has already gotten the green light from local authorities. Notable performers such as singer Bryan Adams, German chanteuse Sarah Connor and Irish singer and guitarist Rea Garvey are expected are on the playbill and likely to draw crowds.

In light of the recent remarks made by the president of Neshaminy School Board, I want the members of the Middletown and Neshaminy communities to know that as a proud Neshaminy graduate and a Middletown supervisor, I denounce and condemn his remarks.
   
 Growing up with a rare disease, my life was much different than most of my friends. I experienced things that many other kids never thought about. Many people don't understand the seemingly invisible barriers that many still face in our society today. In a way, my life has prepared me to be more understanding of different life experiences. At this time more so than ever, it is crucial to understand that the world is bigger than what happens at our front door.
   
 For me, it's simple. I recognize that systemic racism is a problem throughout this country and I'm committed to doing my part to make our community more inclusive. I affirm that black lives matter. This is not a political issue; this is a human rights issue, and human rights are non-negotiable.
   
 It is about treating others with decency and respect, regardless of their race. When the Neshaminy School Board president denounced the organization and then claimed to support the movement that sends a mixed message, and it is tone deaf. This is not a time to get caught up in semantics. These comments were offensive, callous, and dangerous.
   
 As an elected official, you are elected to represent all members of the community and you are expected to treat everyone with respect and decency. There are no two sides to this issue. And our school board is entrusted with the development of children in our community. The weight of this responsibility demands one be held to a higher standard. It is our role to make our schools an environment that all feel welcomed, safe, and secure. To anyone who feels marginalized, frustrated, or angry, know that I'm here for you. I've got your back.
   
 On July 20 the Middletown Township Board of Supervisors began the work to pass an anti-discrimination ordinance and create a Human Relations Council. I encourage everyone to virtually share their thoughts at our hearing scheduled for Aug. 24. My goal in proposing this to my fellow supervisors was simple: make our community more equitable and accessible for all. To me, that doesn't feel political. It just feels right. Our community should help lead the way in combating injustice wherever it presents itself. Again, that should not be a political statement.
   
 As a Middletown supervisor, Neshaminy graduate, local resident, and human being, I encourage the Neshaminy School Board to pass an anti-discrimination ordinance to ensure all students feel welcomed, regardless of their race, gender, sexual orientation, or ability.
   
 Anna Payne is a Middletown Township Supervisor and Neshaminy High School graduate.

Lee Fitzgerald's body was discovered on March 6, 2020, almost one month after he was last seen. At an inquest held into his death Norfolk Coroner's Court on August 11, Yvonne Blake, area coroner for Norfolk, read evidence from Mr Fitzgerald's wife Virginia Fitzgerald, his friend Graham Rumbellow, Suffolk Police, Mr Fitzgerald's GP and a post-mortem report. The court heard how Mr Fitzgerald, who lived in Gislingham, had served in the Royal Marines and on retiring began doing security work for a Saudi family, which would often see him travel abroad for weeks at a time. Virginia Fitzgerald told the court how in the last five years the couple had experienced relationship problems for which they had sought help, but they had subsequently decided to separate. Mrs Fitzgerald said her husband would often disappear for days, sometimes weeks, at a time following an argument, often staying with friends. She said her husband was a "larger than life character" who had a "large group of friends all over the country". Mr Rumbellow told the court how on January 8 he had received a call from Mr Fitzgerald saying he had been in a car crash and needed picking up and taking home. On January 9, shortly before 9am, Mr Rumbellow dropped Mr Fitzgerald off in Diss, and said he "appeared very down". Mr Rumbellow checked in on Mr Fitzgerald at 1pm but had no reply. He did not see him again and that evening he was reported missing. The court heard a police report, which said Mr Fitzgerald's movements were traced on CCTV from Diss to Norwich then Great Yarmouth, where he was last captured walking along the beach. The court also heard from Mr Fitzgerald's GP practice and Dr Jude Chapman, who told the court Mr Fitzgerald had gone to the doctor in December 2019 with symptoms of anxiety and depression, for which he was prescribed medication. He also reported an episode of fainting. A post-mortem report gave Mr Fitzgerald's cause of death as unascertained. Closing the inquest, Ms Blake gave an open conclusion. If you need help and support, call Norfolk and Suffolk Foundation Trust's First Response helpline 0808 196 3494 or the Samaritans on 116 123. Both services are available 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week. You can also download the Stay Alive app on Apple and Android.

Dear Dave,       My in-laws have very generously offered my wife and me $250,000 to help with a down payment on a home. I know the amount exceeds the IRS's yearly gift allowance, but they want to structure it as a family loan and have already told us they don't care if we pay it back. If we accept, we technically owe them a lot of money. If we say no, they may be offended. What do you think about this and how it might impact the relationship?           James                     Dear James,       Well, it makes sense your wife would be on board with the whole thing. It's her dad making the offer, so of course, she would be a lot more comfortable with the idea than you are.          This is a big deal, and it's something you two should have a very serious conversation about. Get on the same page in every regard. Also, I'd recommend making sure you get everything in writing. See to it, as well, that it can be forgiven at the maximum allowable annual gift rate.          In addition, in the event of death, make sure it's included in the estate, it's forgiven and there will be zero call on the note. In effect, that would make it an advance on your inheritance instead of debt. Under no circumstances should they, or any other heirs, have grounds to call the note.          That's a good question, James. And a nice gift!       Dave                     Keeping the side hustle alive                 Dear Dave,       I have a full-time job, but I also have a side job providing firewood to help pay off debt. I make $600 to $1,000 a month with this project. My log splitter went down recently when a hydraulic line burst and the machine caught on fire. I'm not sure how much it will cost to get it going again. Should I invest in a new one that will increase my productivity and help me pay off debt faster?       Chris                     Dear Chris,       If I'm in your shoes, I'm going to fix the old one. Even if it means duct tape and glue, I'm going to try to find a way to repair it instead of spending a bunch of money or going deeper into debt.          If you can't do that at a reasonable price out of pocket, I'd be in the market for a decent, used log splitter. And pay cash! I get your line of thinking when it comes to increasing productivity. Splitting wood is real work. But don't try to justify buying an expensive, new piece of equipment when it's just not necessary.          If you're making that much with a side hustle, you can make your money back on a used splitter in a month or two - three at the most. Be smart about it, Chris!         Dave                     Dave Ramsey is CEO of Ramsey Solutions. He has authored seven best-selling books, including "The Total Money Makeover."

The hopes of the Bundesliga and Germany's top clubs were dashed Monday when health minister Jens Spahn said he would not support a four-point plan for the partial return of fans when the new season begins on September 18.
 Germany was the first of Europe's major leagues to return to action after the coronavirus shutdown, but clubs lose millions of euros in match day revenues for each game played behind closed doors.
 Clubs had hoped senior politicians would back a range of measures, including all-seater stadiums next season, a ban on away fans for the rest of 2020, personalised tickets which can be traced and a ban on alcohol sales at games until October.

 However, both Spahn and Markus Soeder, state premier for Bavaria, said it was too soon to allow fans back into stadiums, especially with the rising daily rate of around 1,000 new cases of COVID-19 in Germany.
 Moving forward, the DFL said that along with the clubs, it will "prepare in the best possible way for a return of stadium visitors" without setting a deadline.

Do you know what your ceiling looks like on sleepless nights? I'm betting you do. Wide-eyed for hours. Anxious. Numb. Searching. Clawing for resolution to another real-life nightmare.
   
 I'm not talking small stuff here. Not the latest skirmish at work. Not some science project needing attention. But you knew that. You're already going where you keep your private stock of worries. My private stock? Well, I'll share three.
   
 For a teenager, a mom who wouldn't be making it through seven years of radical surgeries, radiation, and chemo. Later, a brother-in-law with the same breast cancer succumbing early to a bout of infection. For decades, a son's battle against lethal immune deficiency. I'll leave it there because I know your worries have been, and still are, at least as compelling as mine.
   
 You don't need me telling you what forms the shadows take on your ceiling. Yet, I wonder. Is it possible our tortured night visions are converging? For starters, weakened immune systems stemming from innate biochemistry or exposure to invasive agents are endured by 10 million-plus Americans. Joining them in vulnerability to pathogens are folks with heart disease, lung disease, or diabetes, their numbers burgeoning to 120 million, 37 million, and 35 million, respectively.
   
 Pre-existing conditions abound. Over half of the adults you and I know, along with many children, have one or more of these vulnerabilities.
   
 Since COVID-19 hit, we've been sleepless far more then we should be. And we know why. Here we are, living in the country that has been the greatest juggernaut for scientific achievement and future promise the world has ever known, yet our federal government has responded like a lower tier third-world country. Yes, a man who shares none of our empathy or desire to help others has stuck a crooked stick in the whirring spokes of the great American juggernaut, choosing self-aggrandizement, criminality, and runaway ignorance over you, me, and everything we hold dear -- everything our ancestors worked, fought, and died for.

Giving the boldface lie to hollow claims of patriotism, he has falsely declared it a right to rain death upon fellow citizens -- a few droplets at a time.
   
 Supporting the well-being of all citizens, sacrificing when necessary, is the hallmark of true patriotism. The careless shredding of America's social contract by the serrated edge of claims to rights devoid of responsibility is anything but.
   
 In Edgar Allan Poe's epic short story, The Masque of the Red Death, the arrogant and dismissive Prince Prospero convinces his courtiers to join him for a night of revelry during a virulent plague, assuring them they have nothing to fear.
   
 But their unease grows as a towering ebony clock chimes on toward midnight. At the last stroke of 12, the mask is stripped from a ghoulish stranger, revealing nothing more than an invisible mist within its hollow robes. Thusly freed, the Red Death quickly seeps from room to room, leaving no reveler untouched. Sound familiar?
   
 Yet, COVID-19 is merely the overture to the first act of the looming climate catastrophe and poisoning of America Donald Trump is egging on. Do we continue staring at the ceiling? Most likely. But what else can we do? The words volunteer, donate, influence, and vote come to mind. If any one of us fails to act, Nov. 3, 2020 may strike midnight for the Great American Experiment.

Whereas sustainability agendas once ran counter to the wishes of shareholders, a Harvard Business Review article titled "The Investor Revolution" argues that ESG is now top of mind for investors. Shareholder activism is on the up and up in financial markets and investors are increasingly holding corporate leaders accountable for ESG performance. As such, executives are under pressure to make changes within their organisations, with investors influencing behaviour as shareholders of carbon-intensive companies through active engagement.

The hopes of the Bundesliga and Germany's top clubs were dashed Monday when health minister Jens Spahn said he would not support a four-point plan for the partial return of fans when the new season begins on September 18.Germany was the first of Europe's major leagues to return to action after the coronavirus shutdown, but clubs lose millions of euros in match day revenues for each game played behind closed doors.Clubs had hoped senior politicians would back a range of measures, including all-seater stadiums next season, a ban on away fans for the rest of 2020, personalised tickets which can be traced and a ban on alcohol sales at games until October.However, both Spahn and Markus Soeder, state premier for Bavaria, said it was too soon to allow fans back into stadiums, especially with the rising daily rate of around 1,000 new cases of COVID-19 in Germany.Moving forward, the DFL said that along with the clubs, it will "prepare in the best possible way for a return of stadium visitors" without setting a deadline.",

_Former Royal Marine Lee Fitzgerald has been missing for more than 10 days. Picture: FITZGERALD FAMILY_
 Lee Fitzgerald’s body was discovered on March 6, 2020, almost one month after he was last seen.
 At an inquest held into his death Norfolk Coroner’s Court on August 11, Yvonne Blake, area coroner for Norfolk, read evidence from Mr Fitzgerald’s wife Virginia Fitzgerald, his friend Graham Rumbellow, Suffolk Police, Mr Fitzgerald’s GP and a post-mortem report.
 The court heard how Mr Fitzgerald, who lived in Gislingham, had served in the Royal Marines and on retiring began doing security work for a Saudi family, which would often see him travel abroad for weeks at a time.
 Virginia Fitzgerald told the court how in the last five years the couple had experienced relationship problems for which they had sought help, but they had subsequently decided to separate.
 Mrs Fitzgerald said her husband would often disappear for days, sometimes weeks, at a time following an argument, often staying with friends.
 She said her husband was a “larger than life character” who had a “large group of friends all over the country”.
 Mr Rumbellow told the court how on January 8 he had received a call from Mr Fitzgerald saying he had been in a car crash and needed picking up and taking home.
 On January 9, shortly before 9am, Mr Rumbellow dropped Mr Fitzgerald off in Diss, and said he “appeared very down”.
 Mr Rumbellow checked in on Mr Fitzgerald at 1pm but had no reply. He did not see him again and that evening he was reported missing.
 The court heard a police report, which said Mr Fitzgerald’s movements were traced on CCTV from Diss to Norwich then Great Yarmouth, where he was last captured walking along the beach.
 The court also heard from Mr Fitzgerald’s GP practice and Dr Jude Chapman, who told the court Mr Fitzgerald had gone to the doctor in December 2019 with symptoms of anxiety and depression, for which he was prescribed medication.
 He also reported an episode of fainting.
 A post-mortem report gave Mr Fitzgerald’s cause of death as unascertained.
 Closing the inquest, Ms Blake gave an open conclusion.
