The country has to make total external debt repayments to the tune of $10.3 billion during this year. It just paid out $798 million out of it. The remaining amount of over $9.5 billion is to be paid in 10 months period. The total external debt repayment of $10.3 billion constitutes $8.5 billion as principle payment of loans and $1.8 billion as interest repayment.
 Pakistan’s external loans repayments on account of outstanding foreign commercial loans have been increasing at supersonic speed for two years.
 It is a worrisome development amid Islamabad inability to revive the stalled International Monetary Fund’s program under $6 billion extended fund facility.
 The discontinuation will further compel the incumbent regime to increase its reliance on easiest mode of financing. The foreign commercial loans are obtained for one year period maximum and existing circumstances explained that the reliance on foreign commercial loans is going to be increased manifold in months and quarters ahead.
 In late March, IMF paused discussions with Pakistan on the second review of the three-year extended fund facility program following the coronavirus outbreak. The country received $991 million as the first installment soon after the EFF approval in July last year and following thickened uncertainty about the agreement surrounding in the air for a long time. The second tranche amounted to $452 million.
 The foreign commercial loans have become the easiest source of generating dollar inflows at time of scarcity because the government can easily raise the money through bypassing crucial public procurement rules.
 Out of total external public debt repayments of $798 million, a major chunk of $661 million or 83 percent was paid in shape of principle amount and $137 million or 17 percent was paid as interest payment as external debt obligation during this period.
 Around 26 percent of total external public debt repaid during the last two months constitutes the repayments of the some foreign commercial loans which were obtained by the previous government.
 In July-August, the government settled $204 million worth of commercial loans. Similarly, the government repaid $493 million to multilateral creditors and $102 million to bilateral partners. Considering foreign exchange constraints, financing of development projects and repayment of huge repayment of external public debt compel the incumbent regime to further borrow from multiple sources.
 In July-August, net transfer to the government stood at $1 billion as positive net transfers came mainly due to higher inflows from multilateral development partners. The stock of external loans which was obtained on market based instruments decreased $28 million and the share of concessional loans with longer maturity increased $1 billion, according to economic affairs division.

Moreover, nearly half of the investors said they lost money since the market collapse of February and March, which is stunning because the market is up more than 50% since reaching its low on March 23.
    It’s hard to lose money when the market is gaining ground that hard and fast.
    “We all know how to invest,” says noted financial educator Meb Faber, chief investment officer at the Cambria Funds. “You put your money at risk in businesses through stocks, you invest in real assets through real estate and commodities, and you can be the lender through bonds. Put together a portfolio and it works well historically, wonderfully for many, many decades. The biggest problem is being a human and mucking things up.”
    The focus for investors now, therefore, should be less on going after the perceived opportunities buried just beneath the headlines, but in avoiding the muck-ups.
    Victoria Fernandez, chief market strategist at Crossmark Global Investments, noted in a chat on my show that investors can plumb current events for opportunities, but they are not so much about what is happening today as to what has changed for the long-term future.
    “Some of the things happening right now are setting in place longer-term trends, and that is where we are finding longer-term opportunities,” Fernandez said, “but we’re not getting caught in ‘Let’s do day-trades based on COVID headlines,’ we’re looking at things we think will be beneficial going forward. The longer-term perspective is key right now.”

I would like to change the labour laws in the industry. We do not have a strong sector that guides actors, writers and producers. So, I will change the laws or at least set up proper labour laws for the industry. And of course, there is also the issue of royalties in the industry. It is quite sad. You shoot something and you get paid. They will tell you that it is not a big budget. But at the end of the day, it looks really good and they sell it off for millions of naira and you don’t get royalties for that. So, if there is anything I want changed in the industry, it is proper labour laws and royalties.

Addressing a meeting on law & order at the CM House on Saturday, Syed Murad Ali Shah said that the city’s overall situation has considerably improved, which can be gauged from the fact that Karachi’s ranking in the World Crime Index has gone from sixth in 2014 to 103rd in 2020.
 The World Crime Index surveys crime levels of 396 international cities. It had ranked Karachi sixth in 2014, 10th in 2015, 26th in 2016, 47th in 2017, 50th in 2018, 61st and then 71st in 2019, 88th earlier this year and 103rd by mid- October.
 Sindh police chief IGP Mushtaq Mahar told the meeting that Cape Town has been ranked 19th, Mexico 29th, Kuala Lumpur 38th, Houston 50th, Washington 52nd and Delhi 71st.
 The chief executive said the city can be made safer and more secure if the Safe City Project is implemented at the earliest. He told Mahar to convene a meeting with the National Radio & Telecom Corporation next week for a detailed discussion on the project’s technical and financial proposals.
 The Safe City Project was conceived in 2011, aiming at installing 10,000 high- powered CCTV cameras across the city in the first phase. The CM had approved Rs10 billion for the purpose but the project cost escalated to around Rs20 billion.
 Shah said the security and safety situation as well as the quality of life in the city can be improved with the help of latest technology.
 He directed the police department to install 10,000 cameras at different spots, including in the red zones of the city and the problem areas in terms of criminal activities.
 Eid Milad-un-Nabi
 The IGP told the meeting said that Eid Milad-un-Nabi will be observed on October 30, and the main procession on the occasion will emerge from Memon Masjid at noon. He said the police department will deploy a force of 4,706 personnel for the security of its participants.
 Mahar said that another procession will move from the Merewether Tower at noon and stop at Arambagh Masjid, while the third procession will emerge from Chhutan Shah Mazar at 1:30pm and stop at Purani Numaish. In this way, a total of six processions will emerge from different parts of the city and stop at the spots decided on already, he added. He also said that 947 processions and 902 Mehfils in connection with Eid Milad-un-Nabi will be organised all across the province, and they all will be provided with proper security.
 Chup Tazia
 The IGP said that Chup Tazia will take place on the 8th of Rabi-ul-Awwal, which will fall on October 26, adding that a procession will emerge on the day from the Nishtar Park and stop at Hussainian Iranian Imambargah in Kharadar.
 He said the procession will be provided with security by a force of 8,000 police officials, adding that another procession will move from Qasr-e- Musayyab in Rizvia Society and stop at Shah-e-Najaf Imambargah, and some 1,200 police officials will provide them with security.
 The meeting was informed that 30 Chup Tazia processions will be organised all across the province, of which nine have been declared as most sensitive and five as sensitive.
 Crime situation
 Sharing the crime situation data, Mahar said that in 2019 a total of 423 murders were reported in the city, while in 2020 a total of 414 cases were reported, which showed a difference of nine cases.
 He said that in 2019 a total of 12 target killing cases were registered, while in 2020 a total of eight cases were reported, which showed a reduction of four cases.
 He also said that 31 ransom kidnapping cases were recorded in 2019 and 29 in 2020, extortion cases were 107 in 2019 and 116 in 2020, which showed an increase of nine cases. He added that house robberies were 242 in 2019 and 200 in 2020, which showed a reduction of 42 cases.
 The IGP said that 1,404 four-wheelers were snatched in 2019 and the number came down by 49 in 2020, when 1,355 snatching cases were reported.
 He said that two-wheelers snatched in 2019 were 23,141 and the number increased in 2020 by 5,264, while 15,058 mobile phones were snatched in 2019 and the figure went up to 16,765 in 2020.
 The CM ordered that an app should be developed for immediately filing complaints of mobile, car, motorbike and other snatching incidents and robberies without visiting police stations. “This will help the police activate their force all over the city to arrest criminals.”
 The chief executive was informed that target killings all over the province have come down by 33.3 per cent, murders by two per cent and extortion cases by 14 per cent.
 ‘Fabulous performance’
 The CM lauded the professionally launched operation against dacoits in the kutcha area of Khairpur and Larkana. It was a “fabulous performance” of the police of both the districts, he said.
 IGP Mahar said the operation was launched in the kutcha areas of Baradi Jatoi, falling in the jurisdiction of the Khairpur and Larkana police, adding that in the operation, six notorious dacoits were killed, each of whom had a Rs2 million head money.
 He said that the police recovered an anti-aircraft gun, two G-3 rifles, a sub- machine gun, a rocket launcher with shells and large amounts of ammunition.
 Karachi Corps Commander Lt Gen Humayun Aziz said he will get the anti-aircraft gun and other weapons recovered from the dacoits examined by the military’s arms experts to ascertain from where the dacoits had been obtaining such weapons.
 The chief executive told the meeting that when he was visiting Sukkur earlier, he had appreciated the Khairpur SSP for the successful operation against dacoits.
 Anti-narcotics drive
 The meeting was informed that 8,081 raids have been conducted on drug dens this year, with 12,788 suspects arrested and 10,427 FIRs registered. The meeting was also informed that the police recovered 7,173.959 kilograms of charas, 62.178kg heroin, 23.2kg ice, 170.288kg opium and 195,606 litres of liquor.
 The meeting was told that the police arrested 6,383 people for manufacturing Gutka and Mainpuri, seized 625,153kg Gutka and Mainpuri, and sealed 66 manufacturing units. The IGP said that 5,314 FIRs had been registered during the drive.
 The chief executive urged the police to continue their drive against drug peddlers. “This is a crusade in order to save our next generation from the menace.”
 The meeting was also attended by Information Technology Minister Taimur Talpur, CM’s law adviser Barrister Murtaza Wahab, Chief Secretary Mumtaz Shah, Sindh Rangers Director General Maj Gen Omer Bukhari, CM’s Principal Secretary Sajid Jamal Abro, the home department’s Additional Chief Secretary Usman Chachar and other relevant officials.

When the PTI won the 2018 elections, we hoped to see radical changes in the country – both politically and economically. Was this expectation naive? Definitely not. Because these were the exact promises PM Imran Khan made in his race to be prime minister. During his election campaigns, PM Imran Khan promised across the board accountability; to get rid of corruption in 90 days; and to bring back the looted money. However, all we see is a vicious cycle of blame game and personal vendettas against the members of the previous government in the name of accountability. Accountability of previous prime ministers or other leaders is not against the law, but if the process is to be conducted fairly no individual should be exempted from it. The pandemic has shaken the economy of Pakistan. The country’s economic crisis is the people’s top concern. The nation does not want the government to make more promises, but to fix the economy. It is assumed that the government will face strong criticism from the people who are badly affected by rising inflation, unemployment and lack of food security.

I’m actually an adventurist right from my university days. It was when I was in Part Three that the term Agric Insurance came into existence and I decided to research into it and take it up. In my Part Four, I did a lot of reading; I sought for books and that gave me the confidence that I could do it. My department then said there weren’t enough books and were not going to allow me to do it, but I insisted and pushed so hard till they yielded. I did my thesis in Agric Insurance Development in Nigeria. I actually published about four articles on Agric Insurance during my undergraduate days. So that was the starting point. From there, I was meant to be a lecturer; I wanted to do my master’s in M.Phil; the agreement was that if they allowed me do the programme, I would have to do it to PhD level. I agreed. It was during that time that I stumbled on the pay slip of one of my lecturers: Professor Alimi, who finished his masters when I was in Part 1. He earned N600! I was like what! Is this what I’m coming to do? No way, I said to myself. So when I saw the advert of Nigeria Agric Insurance Company, I applied. They were looking for planning officers. I came first and they appointed me to NICON Insurance instead of Agric Insurance, which was the starting point. Within two years, I wrote their professional examinations and qualified in 1991 and like they say, the rest is history. Yes insurance is a tough call; but I thank God that we did it and God crowned our effort.

A year after Iraqi youths launched mass anti-government protests, elder veterans of past "revolutions" have praise for the idealistic activists but also words of caution born from tough experience.
 Jamil Mozzan, 76, sitting in a Baghdad cafe, has watched with a wary eye as young Iraqis have looked ahead to the first anniversary Sunday of the start of the 2019 "October revolution".
 Like many other elderly Iraqi men, he likes to debate the country's turbulent past and present over cups of tea and water pipes in the capital's storied Al- Mutanabbi street, lined with cafes and book shops.
 "I have experienced many revolutions in my time," said Mozzan, reflecting on past revolts, coups d'etat and uprisings against former dictator Saddam Hussein.
 "But I became disillusioned with the idea of change," sighed the civil engineer whose country is still struggling to emerge from years of war, insurgency and societal chaos.
 Iraq last year saw the biggest protest movement since the fall of Saddam in a 2003 US-led invasion, with Baghdad's iconic Tahrir Square as its epicentre.
 Hundreds of thousands took to the streets demanding the ouster of Iraq's entire political elite, whom they accused of ineptitude, corruption and being beholden to neighbouring Iran.
 Around 600 protesters were killed and thousands wounded in months of street clashes before the movement lost momentum, then ground to halt amid the coronavirus pandemic.
 The protests helped bring in new leaders, but they are yet to deliver major reforms for the youthful country where, the World Bank says, one in three young people is unemployed.
 \- 'A generation will rise' -
 Mozzan recounted how he went down to the protests "to see what could be different this time.
 "I couldn't shout slogans at the top of my lungs because, you know, I'm an old man," he told AFP.
 "But I was completely sympathetic with the youth."
 Academic Khayal al-Jawahiri, the daughter of a famed Iraqi poet, recounted how when she went to Tahrir Square, she was deeply moved to see young protesters hoist a placard bearing her father's verses.
 "A generation will rise from the depths of despair ... seekers of righteousness, mighty and determined," read one of the lines by her father Mohamed al-Jawahiri, who grew up during Iraq's anti-colonial struggle.
 "His poetry explained the suffering of Iraqis," said his daughter, pointing out how it resonates with today's young people who have come of age in another turbulent era.
 "This is a generation of youth that is politically conscious, that did not experience previous uprisings but was moulded by the tough living conditions under leaders unwilling to let go of their power."
 Kevin Jones, author of a book on poetry and revolutions in Iraq, and a Middle East historian at the University of Georgia, said "poetry remains a vital force in modern Iraqi society ... even as the voices, aesthetics and spaces of performance continue to evolve".
 Last year's protests did not just utilise rousing poetry but also political street murals and other forms of artistic expression.
 They were shared widely on social media -- as was footage of the often intense street clashes -- until authorities responded by cutting off the internet for several weeks.
 \- 'Keyboards and Kalashnikovs' -
 Protest activist and poet Ali Riyadh, 27, was dismissive of Iraq's older generation offering its wisdom, considering them elitist and disconnected, like Iraq's politicians.
 He said his generation had come of age in the digital age and at a time of brutal wars and insurgencies, growing up "with keyboards and Kalashnikovs".
 "After 2003 our poetry became an archive of resistance," he said. "It's satirical, it screams and shoots like bullets, because it reflects a certain scarred psychological state."
 Riyadh and his friends were drawn to the caustic satire and profane language of firebrand leftist poets such as Muzaffar al-Nawab and Erian Sayed Khalaf, who were influential from the 1970s onwards.
 "They were true revolutionaries ... their poems were being recited on loudspeakers in the square amid a hail of stun grenades and bullets being fired at us."
 Back at the Baghdad cafe, Mozzan said he worried Sunday's anniversary may fall short of rekindling last year's protest spirit, in part because it is leaderless.
 "The revolutionaries are noble in their aims but any revolution with a chance of success needs a leader," he said.
 Despite his worries, he added: "My advice to the youth is, don't give up on your values."

The current crop of people in power doesn’t care about your knowledge, education, pedigree or anything; because they think the resources are their personal resources. I tell you, the more qualified you are to occupy political positions in this country, the more detestable you are to the forces who think they control power. But for crying out loud; if providence has put you there as president, governor, minister; why don’t you look for qualified people who actually can help you out. Nigerians are all over the globe, doing fantastically well in their respective areas of specialisation. The sad part, however, is that when they bring them in and they in turn realise that you’re not serious, they join you. There are just few people who are able to stand out; like Ngozi Iweala, like the former Minister of Education, Oby Ezekwesili; like the President of African Development Bank (AfDB), Akinwunmi Adeshina.
