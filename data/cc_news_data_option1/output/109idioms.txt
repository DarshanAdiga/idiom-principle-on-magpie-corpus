The search for the Savage Fire Department’s new assistant fire chief is back on.


  On Monday, the Savage City Council voted to hire William Bowser for the job, contingent on passing a background check and medical examination, but city officials said Thursday he had rescinded the offer he’d previously accepted.


  Savage City Administrator Brad Larson said city staff will meet sometime within the next few days to plan their next steps.


  City officials added the assistant chief position to the department’s roster in November after Fire Chief Andrew Slama proposed creating more leadership opportunities and increasing support for day-to-day operations.


  His plan elevated the former full-time deputy chief position to assistant chief and added another paid-on-call deputy chief position to take its place.


  Slama said the department will begin the hiring process for the paid-on-call deputy chief position once an assistant chief is on board.


  The city received 14 applications for the assistant chief position, and Bowser was offered an annual salary of around $82,000.


  He spent 11 years with the Mankato Department of Public Safety in multiple roles, including fire lieutenant. He also served as an infantry officer in the U.S. Army.


  The department currently employs around 38 paid-on-call volunteer firefighters. The city’s two fire stations are each overseen by two captains and one deputy chief.

WATTS UP, PART 2
 On the opposite sideline, the Chiefs will be turning to backup safety Armani Watts to help fill the void created by the loss of standout rookie Juan Thornhill to a torn ACL in Week 17. Watts has primarily played on special teams this season, but he showed plenty of promise as a rookie last season before a season-ending groin injury in October.
 FULLER (TO THE) HOUSE
 The Texans’ offense could be buoyed by the return of Will Fuller V, who has been out with a groin injury. The wide receiver was close to playing against Buffalo, and O’Brien said he’s been “trending in the right direction” but was noncommittal about whether Fuller would play against the Chiefs.
 Fuller gives the Texans a big downfield threat and the opportunity to score regardless of down and distance.
 GROUNDED IN REALITY
 A big reason why Houston beat the Chiefs in Week 6 was Carlos Hyde, who rumbled for 116 yards and scored two touchdowns against his former team. The Texans also ran the ball well last week against Buffalo, while Kansas City’s own offense has struggled to find balance behind running backs Damien Williams, Darwin Thompson and LeSean McCoy.
 The Chiefs have tried to keep McCoy’s workload in check, even making him a healthy scratch late in the year, and now it’s time to see whether the veteran running back still has a couple of big games in him.

A season ago, Muldrow's girls didn't suffer a loss until the area championship game.


  The Lady Bulldogs were then defeated by Anadarko for the 4A title.


  Although another perfect regular season isn't possible for Muldrow since the Lady Bulldogs have already lost three games, coach Jana Armer believes that may help the team more this postseason than last postseason.


  Part of it has already been playing in two high-level tournaments, the Taco Bell Tournament of Champions in Fort Smith and the Tournament of Champions in Tulsa. They lost to Arkansas 5A contender Greenwood, Oklahoma 6A contender Tulsa Booker T. Washington and Oklahoma 3A contender Adair.


  "That's what we wanted to do," Armer said. "We felt like with last year's schedule, our weaknesses weren't brought out until it was too late, and so we wanted those challenges early.


  "We went over to the Fort Smith Tournament of Champions and of course, back to the Tulsa one and saw the number one team in 6A with Booker T. If you don't get better coming out of that, then there's something wrong because they definitely put us to the test, but I feel like we're better because of those three losses."


  Now the Lady Bulldogs (8-3), currently ranked No. 6 in 4A, want to win a tournament title for a change as they get set to host Sallisaw in Thursday's Armstrong Bank Sequoyah County Area Classic semifinals.


  The two NOAA Conference rivals played last month in both teams' opening game of the season, with Muldrow posting a 73-29 win.


  But the Lady Diamonds, who ironically also lost to Tulsa Washington, come in on a roll, having won four straight games. The latest win for Sallisaw (4-3) came on Monday, a 38-36 win against Vian in the first round of the SCAC.


  "They're definitely much better, and they've kind of settled into themselves as well and played some good ball (Monday) night, so it will definitely be a tough game," Armer said.


  The other SCAC girls semifinal Thursday pits a pair of highly ranked teams. Undefeated Roland (8-0), ranked No. 6 in 3A, takes on Central (4-1), currently ranked No. 13 in 2A.


  Those same two teams played in last season's county semifinals, with the Lady Rangers prevailing. The Lady Tigers are eager to reverse the outcome this time.


  "Roland is a really good team; very physical and well-coached, and you know they're tough," Central coach Shane Brown said. "It will be a tough match for us definitely, but it's one we need to play, we need to play those games to help prepare for down the road. ... We're going to try to execute the very best that we can and see what happens, but it's going to be a tough job for us."


  On the boys side, arch-rivals Roland and Muldrow square off in the last of the four games Thursday at Muldrow.


  The Rangers (7-1), who moved up to No. 2 in 3A, defeated Gore in their first- round county game on Monday. As for the Bulldogs (5-3), they are continuing their improved play from last season, in which they won just one game.


  "I think we have a lot more experience," Muldrow coach Terry Collins said. "Last year was like a growing year for us and stuff, so the experience from last year is definitely helping us coming from last year to this year."


  But Collins is well aware of the challenge that awaits his Bulldogs in the form of the Rangers, who are seeking their 11th consecutive Sequoyah County crown.


  "It's going to be a big challenge and stuff; hopefully, we can prepare (Wednesday) so that we can give them a good run for their money," Collins said.


  Thursday's other boys semifinal will be Vian taking on Sallisaw.


  The Wolverines (3-1), who got a late start to their season due to the football team's run to the 2A title game, defeated Gans in their first-round SCAC game Monday while Sallisaw (3-4) is coming off a 57-38 win against Central in Tuesday's opening round.


  The semifinal winners from Thursday will advance to Saturday night's SCAC title games, both also taking place in Muldrow.

Researchers at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff are studying the potential of biochar - a charcoal made from biomass - to reduce the ecological risks associated with common agricultural waste.


   


  According to Hao Chen, PhD, assistant professor for the UAPB Department of Agriculture, the product is increasingly being used throughout the nation as a sustainable soil additive to improve crop yields.


   


  "Agricultural waste, which includes animal manure as well as crop residues, can be a major nuisance for producers," she said. "If farmers have rice husks or crop stems lying in their field, they commonly either let the plant residue sit or decide to burn it. Either practice releases a lot of greenhouse gasses into the environment."


   


  Chen said the conversion of agricultural waste to biochar could help producers deal with agricultural waste in a sustainable manner, minimizing the associated carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to climate change. Moreover, biochar can have a positive effect on soil and water quality in a number of other ways.


   


  "Biochar may look like regular charcoal, but it actually captures agricultural chemicals from the local environment," she said. "The value-added product is produced on a large scale in a few American factories, but it is also easy to make on small farms. For example, some small-scale producers use an oxygen-free tank or burn barrel to turn waste such as peanut hulls, walnut shells or sweet potato stems into biochar."


   


  Biochar can be added to soil through tilling. After application, the product absorbs pesticides and other chemical byproducts of agricultural production. Biochar improves water quality by ensuring nutrients and chemicals are not leached off the field and into the ground water or nearby bodies of water. It also increases soil health and fertility.


   


  Chen said UAPB research on biochar is conducted in conjunction with the University of Florida. Current projects investigate biochar's properties as a soil amendment and in relation to pollution absorption/degradation. Researchers are also studying the ability of biochar to sequester antibiotics in the environment.


   


  "Antibiotics are commonly used in agricultural production and have become a huge problem in recent years," she said. "They are released into the environment in animal manure or from reclaimed irrigation water and have a profoundly negative effect on microorganisms. Biochar applications help ensure antibiotics found in the soil are captured and contained inside the micropores of biochar. Since the micropores are not accessible to microorganisms, the bioavailability and environmental exposure of antibiotics will be largely reduced."


   


  UAPB project data will be used to determine agricultural best management practices for the use of biochar on a large scale, Chen said. Eventually the product could be an affordable substitute for other waste treatment agents such as active carbon.


   


  Chen said the research furthers UAPB's land-grant mission by helping make a clean resource available to small producers, who will be able to improve crop yields. At the same time, they will be contributing to overall local environmental protection.


   


  "Biochar as a value-added product is an innovative and increasingly popular way to make agricultural waste profitable and better ensure soil quality and food productivity in the long run," she said.


   


  The University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff offers all of its Extension and Research programs and services without discrimination.

E.J. Manuel is about as excited as one can be for a national championship game in which his only rooting interest is for a showdown of epic proportions.


  The former NFL and Florida State quarterback plans to live vicariously through Joe Burrow and Trevor Lawrence -- the record-setting quarterbacks for LSU and Clemson, respectively.


  "As an analyst, this is what you hope for," said Manuel, who works as a college football analyst for ESPN and the ACC Network. "And when you have two big-name quarterbacks like Burrow and Lawrence matching up, that's all any college football fan could ask for."


  Ask and ye shall receive


  The College Football Playoff title game, set for Jan. 13 in the Superdome in New Orleans, will feature NFL talent all over the field, but rest assured that this battle royal between a pair of undefeated, dominant teams will be defined by the quarterbacks.


  LSU's Burrow is 23 and hoping to cap with a victory his circuitous journey from a three-year backup at Ohio State to a graduate transfer sensation. He could be the No. 1 selection in the NFL draft in April.


  Clemson's Lawrence is only 20 but already has steered his Tigers to the promised land, going 25-0 as a starter in two seasons, including a 44-16 victory against Alabama in last year's championship game. He's expected to be the No. 1 selection in the 2021 NFL draft.


  "This game is as close as you'll get to seeing NFL talent in college," Manuel said. "Both quarterbacks have great receivers, a tremendous offensive line and offensive coordinators who like to throw the football down the field. It should be one for the ages."


  Ironically, both quarterbacks are coming off performances for the ages.


  Burrow passed for 493 yards with seven touchdowns in LSU's 63-28 demolition of Oklahoma in one semifinal; Lawrence passed for 259 yards and rushed for a career-high 107 in Clemson's 29-23 win against Ohio State in the other.


  Both quarterbacks have played best down the season's homestretch.


  During the past eight games, Lawrence has thrown for 22 touchdowns with no interceptions. He has attempted a school-record 202 consecutive passes without an interception.


  During that same span, Burrow has thrown for 26 touchdowns with three interceptions. He has 2,724 passing yards in LSU's past eight games, an average of 340.5 yards.


  "Statistically what he did is unbelievable," Clemson coach Dabo Swinney said of Burrow, who last month won the Heisman Trophy with the largest percentage of votes in the award's history. "They really just shred everybody, and it starts with him, and it's not just his ability to throw the ball. He's had a great run game support and all that kind of stuff, but he's made great plays with his legs, too. He can move. Just very confident, very accurate."


  No kidding.


  Burrow led the nation in completion percentage, connecting on 77.6% of his throws, and will enter his final game this season with 55 touchdown passes -- seven more than any other quarterback in the country.


  "Some of the throws Joe made in that last game, I was in awe," Manuel said. "It's rare you see that in games. It's one thing to do it in practice, when if you get picked it doesn't matter. But it's another thing to do it in a game with 20 million people watching."


  Manuel was impressed with the way Lawrence absorbed a helmet-to-helmet hit and crunching tackle from Ohio State defenders and bounced back with a touchdown pass and 67-yard touchdown run in the Tigers' next nine plays.


  "When I first saw him get folded up like that, I thought 'Oh no,' but he came back and a few plays later ripped off that big run," Manuel said. "What a sequence of plays. I think he grew up a lot in that moment."


  Now the stage is set for a test of even greater magnitude, with the quarterbacks who first met last summer at the Manning Passing Academy in Thibodaux, Louisiana, taking center stage.


  "We got to spend some time together," Burrow said. "That was a fun week. He's a super-fluid guy for how big he is. He's fun to watch. You can tell he's a great competitor, a tough guy. I respect those kinds of guys."


  The feeling is mutual.


  "I like a lot of things about his game," Lawrence said of Burrow. "He can extend plays and has a good feel for pressure and doesn't take too many sacks. His pocket presence is really good, his accuracy, obviously, and he's pretty mobile, too."


  Bottom line?


  A shootout in the Superdome could be in the offing.


  "It's going to be a challenge," Swinney said. "A great match-up, two great quarterbacks. That's the way a championship game ought to be."
