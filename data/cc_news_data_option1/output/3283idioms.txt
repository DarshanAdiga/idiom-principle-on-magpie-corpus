 As the mother of three young children, I've had many sleepless nights wondering whether to send my kids back to school or put up with another year of distance learning. There are no easy answers; all we can do is mitigate the risks.
 Luckily, technology can help. In the spring, Gov. Gina Raimondo introduced CrushCovidRI, a pandemic response smartphone app. Currently, other than providing basic information, this app is not doing much. Instead, it should take advantage of the exposure notification technology created by Apple and Google and already running on all our smartphones.
 Exposure notification makes use of something your phone likely already does -- every hour, your phone creates a temporary name, a completely random pseudonym, that it broadcasts to all devices within about a six-foot radius. It is also receiving all the pseudonyms from nearby phones. That's how the \"find my phone\" feature of your iPhone works, even when you're not connected to the Internet --other devices that are connected help locate your lost phone.
 Here's how this approach helps in this pandemic. Say I am diagnosed with COVID-19. With my consent and cooperation, the public health authorities will take all the pseudonyms my phone has emitted over the past 14 days and publish them in a database; they are pseudonyms so that my privacy is protected. This part is already in place thanks to an update that Apple and Google have made to our phones' operating systems back in May and does not require me to have installed any special apps ahead of time. Generally, this step can be carried out over the phone or online, so no need to bring my device in person.
 If you and I have been in proximity to each other in the past 14 days -- say, we sat next to each other on the Block Island ferry -- then your smartphone will be able to notify you of exposure. For that part, you need to install an appropriate app. The app will notify you if it finds an overlap between the database of pseudonyms from infected people and the pseudonyms your phone has received.
 This can save lives. Once notified, you can do the right thing -- isolate and get tested. If you are a teacher, you will stay home instead of spreading the infection to the school community. Your child will stay home, saving other kids from the virus. Without exposure notification, you won't know any better until it's too late and you have already infected others.
 The beauty of the system is that it is privacy-preserving. The app would let you know that you've been exposed without clueing you in to who your infected contact was. You will only learn that you were within six feet of an infected person, and the date and duration of exposure. From that alone, you may infer that it was someone on the Block Island ferry if that's the only time you were in proximity to anyone at all that day; but you will have no way of knowing that it was me. Even Apple and Google, the creators of this technology, cannot track anyone using it even if they wanted to -- it's mathematically infeasible.
 Three countries -- Germany, Ireland and Switzerland -- already have started to use exposure notification apps. Virginia became the first U.S. state to do so, and Alabama, Pennsylvania and Arizona will soon follow suit.
 I am a member of an academic team that recommended to Apple and Google that they adopt this technology. Our recommendation was based on its being effective and privacy preserving. I hope Governor Raimondo and the state Department of Health will add this readily-available technology to the CrushCovidRI app so that we can stay safe, even as we open Rhode Island's schools.

Q: How can California avoid future rolling blackouts?
 Investments in electricity storage and distribution would do the trick, Kammen said. But those could be expensive, and even harder to budget for at a time when the state faces huge deficits amid the pandemic-related slowdown.
 California also may have to consider extending the lifetime of its last nuclear power plant in Diablo Canyon. The plant is currently scheduled to close by the end of 2025, and keeping it open would likely face staunch resistance from environmentalists and politicians.
 Conservation might be an easier and quicker option. Californians have done so effectively in the past, most recently in a water-saving campaign during a prolonged drought. But no one knows if homeowners will agree to turn up thermostats a few degrees to prevent blackouts.

Ardoin said repeatedly that he presented a plan that could pass through the Legislature, though he conceded it is “probably not” the best possible plan, saying that’s not possible to produce because of the politics surrounding mail-in voting. He also acknowledged that he knew Edwards would not support the plan, but he has refused to change it. Earlier this year, members of his own party rejected a proposal he crafted with Edwards’ support for the summer elections.
 “This process has boxed us in and put me between a rock and a hard place,” Ardoin said, noting lawmakers didn’t have the option of amending the plan.
 The proposal would roll back the categories of people who could vote by mail significantly from the recently-held summer elections, offering only those who have tested positive for the virus to obtain mail ballots if they don’t meet the normal requirements.
 That’s a departure from the summer elections, when people who had serious medical conditions, were quarantined or caring for someone who was quarantined could obtain absentee ballots. Relatively few--1,863 voters--took advantage of those reasons in the July 11 election, though that contest saw far lower turnout than the upcoming presidential election will have.
 Democrats and at least one Republican blasted the plan as inadequate. The governor has said he thinks at a minimum people should be able to vote by mail if they are quarantining, caring for someone with COVID-19 or at higher risk because of health issues.
 “Anything to suppress a vote is on the wrong side of history for me,” said Rep. Malinda White, D-Bogalusa.
 Baton Rouge Rep. Barry Ivey, the only Republican to vote against the plan, implored his colleagues to reject the proposal and have both sides come to an agreement to pass a plan similar to the one for the summer elections. Ardoin has said he doesn’t have time to craft a new plan if either side rejects this one.
 “Passing this plan today virtually guarantees we’re passing our responsibility to the courts,” Ivey said. “...I don’t want to hand this over to the courts.”

Bloomberg) -- When billionaire Lex Greensill won an $800 million investment from the SoftBank Vision Fund last year to develop new technology and expand his trade-finance empire, the bulk of the money went to a small, unprofitable German lender.
 Greensill Bank, a 93-year-old firm known as NordFinanz Bank AG until the Australian financier bought it in 2014, suddenly found itself flush with capital. The size of its balance sheet increased more than seven-fold while it offered above-market interest rates to attract deposits that it would then invest in assets sourced by its parent, Greensill Capital.
 The growth of the Bremen-based bank has attracted the scrutiny of Germany’s main regulator as well as its deposit-insurance program, according to people familiar with the matter. They worry that too many of the assets on the bank’s books are ultimately tied to the same source: British-Indian entrepreneur Sanjeev Gupta. The watchdogs have been reviewing the portfolio to determine the extent of the ties and are considering imposing caps or additional capital demands if they deem that the concentration isn’t low enough, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private.
 The regulators’ concerns highlight the challenges for Greensill as he takes on the large Wall Street banks in the business of supply-chain finance. A former banker himself at Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc., he has vowed to take a big chunk of that market by buying trade receivables or payables, packaging the short-term debt and selling it to investors. Greensill Bank functions as a “warehouse” for such deals, he told Financial News last year.
 Gupta is the head of GFG Alliance. He invests in and revamps moribund steel and power plants. Securities linked to Gupta and arranged by Greensill were among investments at the center of a 2018 crisis at Swiss asset manager GAM Holding AG that brought down star trader Tim Haywood. They also featured prominently in supply-chain finance funds at Credit Suisse Group AG, for which the bank teamed up with Greensill.
 The problem, in the eyes of the regulators, is that a large portion of Greensill Bank’s credit portfolio is made up of loans to customers of companies that Gupta controls, the people said. Debts sourced from a group of linked companies made up around two-thirds of loans at the bank, according to a report published in August 2019 by Scope Ratings, a privately held company based in Berlin that specializes in ratings of financial institutions.
 Since the Scope report was published, the share of Gupta-linked loans has been cut and it’s possible that no regulatory steps will be taken, the people said. Greensill has also made a number of acquisitions to help grow and diversify its trade-finance portfolio, among them Finacity, a boutique that specializes in securitizing receivables.
 Even if assets linked to Gupta have been reduced from previous levels, regulators are concerned about high concentration to a single group, the people said. Having a lot of assets tied to one source could leave Greensill Bank at risk of losing a big chunk of investment income should that source disappear, particularly since many of the assets are short-term.
 The Association of German Banks, which runs the voluntary deposit-insurance program for private-sector lenders, recently concluded a probe into Greensill Bank that was conducted through an independent assessment unit. The review, which isn’t public, showed reservations about risk concentration in the bank’s portfolio, the people said.
 ‘Constructive Dialogues’
 BaFin, too, views the Gupta-linked assets on the bank’s balance sheet as an excessive concentration risk and is considering additional capital demands and a cap on the exposure, the people said. BaFin hasn’t made a decision, and it’s also possible that the regulator won’t act if the concentration risk is reduced further.
 “Greensill Bank is strongly capitalized, is in full compliance with its regulatory requirements, and all its trade receivables are fully insured,” said a spokesman for the firm. “We have regular, constructive dialogues with the appropriate regulators in Germany and all jurisdictions where we operate.”
 Representatives for BaFin, the banking association and its assessment unit declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Gupta’s GFG.
 Neither Greensill Bank nor its predecessor have made an annual profit beyond a break-even in the decade through 2018, according to publicly available documents. Scope said the lender turned profitable in the fourth quarter of 2018, and posted an operating profit of 2.6 million euros in the first five months of 2019, helped by the recent capital injection.
 Scope noted in its report that the financial performance of Greensill Bank “will depend crucially” on the parent’s ability to generate enough assets for the bank to invest in. Its performance is also impacted by costs to hedge against currency swings and insure assets against default, the report said.
 The bank currently pays a 0.7% interest rate for euro deposits that are placed for a year. That’s the highest among the German banks listed on Weltsparen.de, a comparison website. Customer deposits more than tripled to 960 million euros from the end of 2017 to May last year, according to the Scope report.
 Membership in the deposit insurance is crucial for banks operating in Germany to reassure clients their money is safe. Greensill Bank displays its association membership prominently on its website. Because it has no branches, it relies on brokers and retail websites to win customers.
 BaFin may be particularly zealous in guarding against any potential issues after coming under fire this year for failing to prevent a massive accounting fraud at payments provider Wirecard AG. While Wirecard owned a German bank that was supervised by BaFin, the rest of the company wasn’t, because it was viewed mainly as a technology firm.
 Greensill, too, describes itself as a fintech, though much of its technology is from third-party providers. In its early days, a lot of its business was tied to Gupta, for whose companies he has arranged hundreds of millions of euros in financings.
 Haywood’s funds at GAM, for instance, held large amounts of notes tied to Gupta’s companies that were sourced by Greensill. The investments worked well for Haywood, who ran the firm’s second-biggest strategy by assets at the time. But after an internal probe uncovered potential misconduct issues by the fund manager, GAM suspended him in mid-2018, saying he didn’t do sufficient due diligence on some holdings and that he broke the company’s gift policy.
 Haywood, who has since left GAM, has rejected the allegations.
 His suspension triggered a flood of redemptions, forcing GAM to freeze Haywood’s funds because it couldn’t find a buyer fast enough for some of the assets. GAM eventually returned all investor money in the funds with a small profit, though it took almost a year to offload more than $1 billion of bonds linked to GFG projects.
 Credit Suisse’s asset management arm, which had bought Gupta-linked assets as well through its supply-chain finance funds, also trimmed its holdings at the time.
 When Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank Vision Fund agreed in May of last year to invest $800 million in Greensill Capital, it came at an opportune time. The collapse of Haywood’s funds had left Greensill without a major buyer of his trade- finance notes. GAM funds had also provided 300 million euros of direct loans to Greensill Capital through a vehicle called Laufer.
 ‘Liquidity Requirements’
 “The Vision Fund’s investment will accelerate Greensill’s development of new technology to further improve access to capital for companies globally and meaningfully enhance the firm’s ability to support the development of a broad, liquid capital market for working capital finance assets,” Greensill said in a press release at the time. Greensill also said at the time that it would make a push into markets such as Brazil, China and India.
 Most of the money went into the German lender, according to Scope and an interview with Greensill by Financial News last year. Having a “bank with oodles of cash” was a hedge against economic uncertainty, he told Financial News at the time. Greensill Bank “is as much as anything a warehouse that provides us with the ability to manage the liquidity requirements of our business.”
 It’s not clear whether any of the Gupta assets GAM was liquidating ended up on the balance sheet of the freshly capitalized Greensill Bank at the time. SoftBank provided another $655 million capital injection in October, to finance Greensill’s global expansion and development of new products.
 A spokesperson for SoftBank declined to comment.

Mississippi Braves
 The Mississippi Braves, who are owned by the Atlanta Braves, are the only Southern League team to carry the name of their parent club. There is certainly a precedent for this conservative name choice. Prior to moving to Pearl, Mississippi, the team spent 21 seasons as the Greenville (South Carolina) Braves. This was preceded by 13 seasons as the Savannah Braves. The last time this franchise wasn't an Atlanta affiliate named the Braves was in 1970, its final season as the Cleveland-affiliated Savannah Indians.
 Montgomery Biscuits
 From both an architectural and historical perspective, the Biscuits' home of Riverwalk Stadium is one of the most unique in the Minor Leagues. A goodly portion of the stadium's structure, extending down the first-base line, is a refurbished train shed. And before that site had been home to a train shed, it was a cotton depot-turned-Confederate military prison. A commemorative plaque located outside of the ballpark explains that the majority of the 700 Union soldiers housed there were captured at Shiloh. "They were imprisoned in a foul, vermin-abounding cotton depot...without blankets and only the hard earth of wood planks as a bed," the plaque reads in part.

KEWANEE -- The Wethersfield School District is going from a "good news" year to an uncertain one, the Board of Education learned at its recent August meeting.
   
 Supt. Shane Kazubowski presented the balances for the end of Fiscal Year 2020 and a review of the tentative FY2021 budget, which will be considered for approval at the Sept. 10 board meeting.
   
 Kazubowski described FY20 as a "good news report," as the fiscal year ended with surplus balances in the four main funds, Education, Operations and Maintenance, Debt Service and Transportation.
   
 Overall, the year ended with a total balance of $202,460 and earned the district the highest financial recognition rating possible from the state for the third year in a row. The district has 163.18 days in cash reserves on hand in the four major funds. Auditors from Gorenz & Associates reviewed the district's finances during their annual visit in late July, shortened somewhat this year since some of the work was done remotely as well as in the unit office. An auditor's report will be presented at the October meeting.
   
 Kazubowski said the uncertainty of revenue and expenses in the coming fiscal year due to the COVID pandemic makes budgeting difficult. He said the state claims it will "hold harmless" funding for education, but with its tax income reduced by the pandemic, it's hard to see the money will be there to adequately fund schools.
   
 Kazubowski presented his customary "worst case scenario" budget with revenue numbers figured low and expenses high. At the end of the past five fiscal years, the district has ended up in the black. Next year, it may be harder to hit that mark.
   
 "We want to figure the budget so there are as few surprises as possible," Kazubowski told the board.
   
 In addition to anticipating less money from state and federal sources, he said categorical payments for transportation, vocational grants and pre- kindergarten may be fewer and farther between.
   
 "There are a lot of unknowns going into this fiscal year," the superintendent said.
   
 Last year 90 percent of $2.2 million in General State Aid went into the education fund, the district's largest, which covers teacher's salaries; 10 percent went to operations and maintenance, but more will be shifted into that fund in the coming year to cover the additional expense of dealing with COVID.
   
 On utilities, Kazubowski said the savings from solar panels, which went online last month, are not yet known. He said they may be offset by the purchase of air-cooling units to make classrooms safer, which the budget reflects.
   
 On the positive side, Henry County's Equalized Assessed Valuation was up 4.38 percent, which should generate $75,800 in local revenue. He said the rate of increase is usually 1.4 to1.5 percent. Kazubowski said steady increases in the EAV are what is needed to keep the budget balanced.
   
 The "worst case" FY21 budget lists a deficit of $210,000, it but will hopefully end with a positive number as in past years with careful planning, Kazubowski said.
   
 The board approved issuing $1.1 million in General Obligation Bonds to be paid off over five years for the purpose of increasing the Working Cash Fund, from which $250,000 will be transferred to the Education Fund and $60,000 to the Capital Projects Fund to cover COVID costs.
   
 The district's bonding agent, Kevin Heid, explained that the extremely low bid of 1.24 percent interest was made by a township treasurer of schools in Cook County who manages finances for all schools in that area and has millions to invest. Heid explained that the treasurer thought District 230's financial condition was sound, which qualified it for the lower rate.
   
 "That's a good deal for the taxpayers," Heid said.
   
 After closed session the board approved:
       The retirement of first-grade teacher Karen Horack, effective Aug. 24.   The resignations of Penny Hayes and Lynn Rowley as cafeteria assistants, effective immediately.   The employment of Nichole Rachel and Mandy Girkin as cafeteria assistants for the 2020-2021 school year.

The Southern League, established in 1964, is the youngest of Minor League Baseball's three Double-A leagues. But, as with almost everything regarding Minor League Baseball history, it's complicated. The first circuit named the Southern League operated sporadically over the final 15 years of the 19th century. This was followed by the Southern Association, which ran from 1901 through 1961 and disbanded, in part, due to its refusal to field racially integrated teams. To fill the void, the South Atlantic League was elevated to Double-A in 1963. In 1964, that Double-A South Atlantic League was rechristened the Southern League. Initially comprised of eight clubs, it expanded to its current 10-team format in 1978. What follows, then, are 10 facts. One for every team in the league.
 Biloxi Shuckers
 The Shuckers, previously the Huntsville Stars, played their inaugural season in 2015. Unfortunately, due to construction delays, their home of MGM Park didn't open until June 6 of that year. Thus, the Double-A Milwaukee affiliate began its existence with an epic two-month road trip. During this time, the Shuckers played 15 of their 25 home games at Huntsville's Joe Davis Stadium. They also went on the road, but played as the home team, against the Mississippi Braves and the Jacksonville Suns. The Shuckers were in first place by the time they played their first game in MGM Park, en route to the best record in the Southern League that season.
 Birmingham Barons
 If you want to win a bar bet on a technicality, go with this fact: Michael Jordan never played a Minor League Baseball game in Birmingham. Yes, the moonlighting dunksmith famously spent the 1994 season as a member of the Barons' outfield corps. But that 1994 season, as with every one between 1988 and 2012, the Double-A Chicago White Sox affiliate played at Hoover Metropolitan Stadium. This facility, as its name makes clear, was located not in Birmingham but in the nearby suburb of Hoover.
 Chattanooga Lookouts
 The Chattanooga Lookouts were a charter member of today's Southern League, but the Lookouts name goes back further than that. Much further. Chattanooga's first professional baseball team was established in 1885, and they were named the Lookouts (in honor of nearby Lookout Mountain, of course). The only team in all of Minor League Baseball with a more deep-rooted name is the Buffalo Bisons, as that moniker can be traced back to 1877.
 Jackson Generals
 After 13 seasons as the Diamond Jaxx, Jackson, Tennessee's Southern League team changed its name to the Generals in 2011. This was an homage to the city's Minor League history, as Jackson fielded a team named the Generals from 1935 through 1953. The Jackson Generals of Tennessee are not to be confused with the Jackson Generals of Mississippi, however. That franchise played in the Texas League from 1991 through 1999 before relocating to Round Rock and becoming the Express. To make things more confusing, the Southern League currently has a Jackson, Mississippi-based team in the form of the Mississippi Braves (who actually operate out of nearby Pearl). The Mississippi Braves periodically honor their region's baseball history by suiting up as the Jackson Generals. Their opponent on these occasions? The Tennessee-based Jackson Generals, of course.

Bloomberg) -- Kamala Harris’s prime-time speech at the Democratic convention on Wednesday night will be the first glimpse of how Joe Biden’s campaign plans to deploy a history-making vice presidential nominee as they work to define her role for a campaign that has largely been grounded by the coronavirus.
 The Biden campaign has a clear idea of the people they want Harris to win over in November: Black voters, younger voters and women. But as they strictly abide by health guidelines forced by coronavirus, they are severely limiting the candidates’ travel to in-person events and sharing few details about how Harris will engage with voters.
 Harris, a California senator and former state attorney general, distinguished herself during the primaries with sharp attacks on Biden’s civil rights record, nearly turning the race upside-down and exposing a possible liability to Biden’s candidacy among liberals, minorities and young people.
 Now, she’ll attempt to rally those same key constituencies around Biden, starting with the day before he accepts his party’s nomination. Her speech on Wednesday will be a critical opportunity to re-introduce herself to what will be one of the largest audiences she will reach before November. She is expected to share her cross-cultural origin story which echoes that of former President Barack Obama.
 The daughter of divorced immigrant parents, a University of California- Berkeley biologist from India, and a Stanford economics professor from Jamaica, she grew up a child of the civil rights movement in 1960s Oakland, California. She later attended Howard University, a historically black university in Washington, DC.
 That biography has energized key constituency groups, especially Black women. Members of her Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority were mainstays on the campaign trail when she was running for president and are expected to mobilize in force to support the new ticket.
 Harris will also have to navigate her background as a prosecutor after a summer of nationwide protests against police brutality and systemic racism. She was elected district attorney in San Francisco in 2003 and attorney general of California in 2010. After her election to the U.S. Senate in 2017, she earned a reputation for her incisive cross-examination of witness in Senate hearings, in particular Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
 She’s already signaling that she’ll bring that prosecutorial style to the campaign.
 “The case against Donald Trump and Mike Pence is open and shut,” she said last week as Biden announced her as his running mate.
 In the week since, she’s proved to be a safe choice, but not a game-changing one. And that’s the best that any presidential candidate can ask for.
 “I don’t think it matters who the vice presidential candidate is historically,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on MSNBC before Harris was selected. She noted exceptions like “Lyndon Johnson for victory and Sarah Palin for defeat,” but added, “By and large it’s all about the two candidates for president.”
 Indeed, polls show Harris has made no difference to the vast majority of voters. An ABC/Washington Post poll Monday found 69% said the choice did not make them more or less likely to vote for the Democratic ticket. Only 18%, mostly liberals and African Americans, said Harris made them more likely to vote for Biden, and 11% said they were less likely to vote for the former vice president.
 Still, she seems to have passed the most important test. Voters see her as just as ready to take over the presidency as current Vice President Mike Pence, with 55% of voters seeing them both as qualified.
 Christopher Devine of the University of Dayton, and Kyle Kopco, authors of the book “Do Running Mates Matter?” say the choice matters mostly because of what it says about the candidate at the top of the ticket. The pick is the first presidential decision a candidate makes, and this one provides a window into Biden’s judgment and his ideology.
 “It’s a signal of whether Joe Biden is going to the left or anchoring himself in the center where he’s always stood,” Devine said. “Harris probably nudges him a little to the left. At the very least it’s a signal that he sees the importance of the left to his campaign.”
 During her 10-month campaign for the presidential nomination, Harris herself struggled to define herself ideologically in a crowded field of candidates. She positioned herself to the left of moderates like Biden, but never ventured as far as Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren.
 She briefly soared to second place in the polls after her debate takedown of Biden’s past positions on forced busing to enforce school desegregation and his work with senators who were segregationists.
 But among the biggest differences with Biden during the primary campaign was her short-lived support for Medicare for All — the latest branding of a single-payer, government-run health care system. She retreated from that position while still a presidential candidate.
 Her lack of a defined message combined with staff infighting and fundraising struggles led to the demise of her campaign in December, an early exit that likely helped preserve her chances to join the ticket.
 After Wednesday’s speech, Harris’s next big moment will be her debate against Pence in October, but most of her attacks are sure to be directed to the top of the Republican ticket. And how Trump responds could be more revealing than the attacks themselves.
 Trump has called her a “mad woman,” the “meanest” senator, a “nasty” woman and “disrespectful” to his Supreme Court picks and even Biden himself.
 “We’ve seen this with Donald Trump going back to 2016,” Devine said. “His response seems to be more aggressive when it comes to being challenged by women as opposed to men.
 “Kamala Harris could be that threat,” he said.

“I look at volunteering as an opportunity to assist organizations and causes that are close to my heart, whether it be in the Marine Corps community, or my children’s schools and extracurricular activities,” Norris said. “Through volunteering, I have met some of my closest friends.”
 Along with working as a substitute teacher at local schools, Norris volunteers at her church, her son’s sports league and with her school’s alumni association.   All this on top of taking care of her three children, sometimes single- handedly when her husband, Lt. Col. Andrew Norris, is away on deployment. Lt. Col. Norris commands an MV-22 squadron at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar.
 “The Marine Corps has presented Kailee with many of the same challenges it gives to every military spouse. She has moved 10 times in 18 years and has been through five deployments,” said Kelli Richardson, a friend who works with Norris on the Family Readiness Command Team and nominated her for the award. “Her kindness, compassion, and willingness to help go hand in hand with her resiliency, strength and dedication to her families, both immediate and military,” said Richardson, a group family readiness coordinator at MCAS Miramar.
 The award was established in 2011 by Maj. Glenn Ferguson, 98, a World War II pilot and Korean War veteran who served in the Marine Corps. The Escondido resident created the award in memory of his late wife of 64 years, Irene Ferguson, to honor the sacrifices Marine wives make to support their husbands.

Thomas Michael Brogden Sr. This memorial is a touching example of how to celebrate a rich and full life of a man who worshiped the lord, loved his family and friends. Thomas Michael Brogden was born on March 10, 1959 to the union of Newton Hugo and Angeline (Fiest) Brogden in Bismarck, ND. He was born the 4th out of 5 children. In 1984 Thomas met the woman who would later became the love of his life, Stephanie; On February 2, 1987, Thomas married the love of his life Stephanie, together they had 2 children. Thomas spoke highly of his family and instilled the same love and passion into rising his children in the Lord. In 2001, Thomas and his family relocated to Calhoun, GA. He worked at Erlanger Hospital in Tennessee as a medical technologist. He expressed the same amount of passion into his work as he did his life. That passionate drive led to the modification of a commonly used device. The modification that Thomas made was used in the lab allowing the employees to work at a more efficient and productive pace. He believed in putting your best foot forward in every aspect of his life. Thomas was Mr. Fix-It, and a jack of all trades. He enjoyed many things from a culinary taste for curry and Asian dishes to scuba diving and most importantly, his mission work for the church. Thomas would travel abroad and donate his time to helping the less fortunate experience the touch of the Lord through clean water, medical care, building churches and showing compassion. Thomas gave a new meaning to the word friend. He was a warm and caring man, and an all-around good human being who lived to love people. All who loved him dearly will never forget his generosity, his wit, his charm, and undying love and care for them. He leaves to cherish his memory: wife Stephanie Brogden, Rachel (daughter), Michael (son), sisters Julie (Terry) & Debbie (Wes). Sisters-in-law Annette, Margaret (Kamal), Jennifer (spouse-deceased), and Katherine (Christopher), brother-in-law's Franklin and Frank, along with many nieces and nephews.

SPRINGFIELD - State and local officials in the Metro East area near St. Louis cautioned residents on both sides of the Illinois-Missouri line Monday to be diligent about protecting themselves and others from COVID-19.
   
 "It is in the best interests of all St. Louis and Metro East residents, Illinoisans, and Missourians alike, to take action now to bring down the positivity rate," Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said during a news conference in East St. Louis. "And we're working together across the border to make sure that that happens."
   
 Pritzker's comments came one day after the Illinois Department of Public Health announced new social and economic restrictions for the six-county area in the wake of the region's rising number of cases and test positivity rate.
   
 He was joined at the event IDPH Director Dr. Ngoki Ezike, St. Clair County Board Chairman Mark Kern, East Side Health District Administrator Elizabeth Patton Whiteside and East St. Louis Mayor Robert Eastern III.
   
 Eastern recently recovered from COVID-19.
   
 "I was diagnosed positive on July 13," he said. "I was OK, feeling-wise. That Wednesday (July 15) hit me like a ton of bricks. I never felt that bad in my life. I was scared not knowing what the outcome may be."
   
 Eastern noted that the city of East St. Louis recently enacted a mandate that all individuals within the city limits wear a face covering whenever they are outside of a private residence.
   
 "East St. Louis, I ask you to stay patient and to take proper safety measures so we all can start focusing back on rebuilding a new normal," he said.
   
 As of Friday, Aug. 14, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health, that region had experienced nine consecutive days of rising positivity rates, including four consecutive days of rates above 8 percent. The rolling seven- day average positivity rate stood at 8.9 percent.
   
 "If you haven't been taking this seriously yet, now is the time to start," Pritzker said. "Wear a mask to maximize the chance that children can have in- person learning this fall. Maintain six feet of physical distance to keep the small business owners' dining rooms open and retail stores in business. Each of us has a role to play in the future of this region's health and economy."
   
 The new mitigation efforts are not as severe as those that were in place statewide during Phase 3 of the reopening plan, which ended June 26. But they are more stringent than those that have been in place during Phase 4. They include requiring bars and restaurants to close at 11 p.m. and limiting seating in those establishments to six people per table.
   
 Bars are being told to seat people only at tables and to remove bar stools to prevent gathering around the bar.
   
 Elsewhere, public gatherings, meetings and social events will be limited to 25 guests or 25 percent of the overall room capacity. All reception halls will be closed and party buses will be shut down.
   
 Casinos are being ordered to close at 11 p.m. and are limited to 25 percent capacity.
   
 Those restrictions will remain in place for at least 14 days, which is the average incubation period for the virus. If the test positivity rate does not fall below 8 percent during that time, IDPH said more stringent measures will be imposed, possibly including the closure of bars and restaurants
   
 "On the flip side, if the positivity rate falls below 6.5 percent, on average, these new mitigation measures will be removed and this region will return to Phase 4 of the Restore Illinois plan," Pritzker said.
   
 Metro East is the first of the state's 11 regions to reach the resurgence levels that trigger new restrictions. The region consists of Bond, Clinton, Madison, Monroe, Randolph and St. Clair counties.
   
 Communities in the region include Alton, Belleville, Collinsville, Columbus, East St. Louis, Granite City and Scott Air Force Base.
   
 Officials have attributed much of the increase to cross-border travel to and from St. Louis, where mitigation efforts have been less strict than in Illinois since the start of the pandemic.
   
 In addition to the new measures in the Metro East region, IDPH also issued a COVID-19 travel advisory map on Monday, as well as guidance for people traveling domestically or internationally. The map shows states with an average daily case count 15 per 100,000 population or greater. Illinois is at 14 cases per 100,000 population.
   
 The documents do not restrict Illinoisans' travel but offer advice about the places that pose the highest risk and how to stay protected while traveling.
   
 "We know that people may have to travel," Ezike said, "but potentially based on where you may go, that travel may increase your risk of exposure to COVID-19 by putting you in contact with people who have a higher chance of having the virus."
   
 IDPH also announced Monday that the state had recorded 1,773 new cases of COVID-19 over the previous 24 hours. That followed 1,562 cases reported Sunday and 1,828 on Saturday. That brought the statewide total number of cases since the pandemic began to 207,854.
   
 IDPH also reported 35 additional virus-related deaths since Friday afternoon, bringing the statewide total to 7,756.
   
 Laboratories have processed just over 3.4 million COVID-19 tests. The single- day statewide positivity rate on Monday was 4.6 percent. The rolling seven-day average positivity rate was 4.2 percent.

As the mother of three young children, I've had many sleepless nights wondering whether to send my kids back to school or put up with another year of distance learning. There are no easy answers; all we can do is mitigate the risks.
   
 Luckily, technology can help. In the spring, Gov. Gina Raimondo introduced CrushCovidRI, a pandemic response smartphone app. Currently, other than providing basic information, this app is not doing much. Instead, it should take advantage of the exposure notification technology created by Apple and Google and already running on all our smartphones.
   
 Exposure notification makes use of something your phone likely already does -- every hour, your phone creates a temporary name, a completely random pseudonym, that it broadcasts to all devices within about a six-foot radius. It is also receiving all the pseudonyms from nearby phones. That's how the "find my phone" feature of your iPhone works, even when you're not connected to the Internet --other devices that are connected help locate your lost phone.
   
 Here's how this approach helps in this pandemic. Say I am diagnosed with COVID-19. With my consent and cooperation, the public health authorities will take all the pseudonyms my phone has emitted over the past 14 days and publish them in a database; they are pseudonyms so that my privacy is protected. This part is already in place thanks to an update that Apple and Google have made to our phones' operating systems back in May and does not require me to have installed any special apps ahead of time. Generally, this step can be carried out over the phone or online, so no need to bring my device in person.
   
 If you and I have been in proximity to each other in the past 14 days -- say, we sat next to each other on the Block Island ferry -- then your smartphone will be able to notify you of exposure. For that part, you need to install an appropriate app. The app will notify you if it finds an overlap between the database of pseudonyms from infected people and the pseudonyms your phone has received.
   
 This can save lives. Once notified, you can do the right thing -- isolate and get tested. If you are a teacher, you will stay home instead of spreading the infection to the school community. Your child will stay home, saving other kids from the virus. Without exposure notification, you won't know any better until it's too late and you have already infected others.
   
 The beauty of the system is that it is privacy-preserving. The app would let you know that you've been exposed without clueing you in to who your infected contact was. You will only learn that you were within six feet of an infected person, and the date and duration of exposure. From that alone, you may infer that it was someone on the Block Island ferry if that's the only time you were in proximity to anyone at all that day; but you will have no way of knowing that it was me. Even Apple and Google, the creators of this technology, cannot track anyone using it even if they wanted to -- it's mathematically infeasible.
   
 Three countries -- Germany, Ireland and Switzerland -- already have started to use exposure notification apps. Virginia became the first U.S. state to do so, and Alabama, Pennsylvania and Arizona will soon follow suit.
   
 I am a member of an academic team that recommended to Apple and Google that they adopt this technology. Our recommendation was based on its being effective and privacy preserving. I hope Governor Raimondo and the state Department of Health will add this readily-available technology to the CrushCovidRI app so that we can stay safe, even as we open Rhode Island's schools.

When I was in high school, I was always on the committees responsible for planning assemblies and school dances — and I handled the role with all of the teenage reverence the position demanded.
 Now that I’m (ostensibly) an adult, when I think back on the projects, deadlines and teamwork that were part-and-parcel with my time on all of those long-ago committees, I can’t help but to see definite through-lines to my work with the library.
 Especially now that Yakima Valley Libraries has completed requirements that allow us to provide contact-free curbside pickup of library materials, I’m seeing that same level of teamwork and collaboration that I loved to be part of as a teenager, as library staff and management pull together to get this new service off the ground.
 Many of you are probably already aware that our timeline for offering contact- free holds pickup began this week, but as we draw closer to offering full pickup service, I wanted to share a more detailed overview of what you can expect in the coming days.
 Beginning on Saturday, Aug. 22, we will re-activate the option for you to place new requests for library materials, online or by phone.
 Then, beginning on Monday, Aug. 24, our online appointment scheduling system will be available for you to select a day and time to pick up your requested materials.
 If needed, you can also call your preferred community library and staff will schedule a pickup appointment for you over the phone.
 However, before you make an appointment to pick up requested materials, please be sure that your library materials are in “held” status on your library account.
 This step is important as it ensures that your items have arrived at your preferred community library and are available for pickup.
 A tip about verifying that your holds are ready: If you already receive email and/or text message notifications from the library, we will use one or more of those methods to notify you when holds are ready.
 Alternatively, you can also check your account status online or call your community library to confirm that items are ready for pickup.
 When you arrive at your preferred library for your pickup appointment, look for the yellow “Contact-Free Holds Pick Up” signs. In order to ensure a fully no-contact pickup, we ask that you remain in your vehicle and call the phone number on the sign. At that point, library staff will verify your identity, and will prepare your library materials for you.
 Library materials will be checked out on your account, and a library employee will place the materials outside the library in a designated no-contact pickup location. Once staff have returned to the building, you can exit your vehicle to collect your library materials.
 Please also note that library staff are not permitted to accept returns in- person; instead, we ask that you place returned materials into an outdoor book return.
 For more information about contact-free curbside pickup, visit www.yvl.org/pickup, and remember that we will not be accepting pickup appointments online or by phone until Monday, Aug. 24.
 In closing, I’d like to add that this service is as new to us as it is to you, so we appreciate your patience, understanding and cooperation as we get things up and running.
 We’re looking forward to serving you again very soon!
