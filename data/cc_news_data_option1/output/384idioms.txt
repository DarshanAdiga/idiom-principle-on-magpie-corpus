The researchers believe the great diversity and numbers of bees in cities is due to the availability of suitable habitats available for wild bees and bumblebees. Good nesting opportunities are found in exposed soils, dead wood and wall cavities, and the large variety of flowering plants in parks and gardens ensures a reliable food supply. Also, bees probably cope better with the challenge of highly dynamic city life than other groups of insects. "Urban people are constantly changing their environment. Finding your way around is a challenge that bees are particularly well-equipped to deal with due to their highly developed orientation and learning skills," says the head of the study, Prof Robert Paxton, scientist from Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (MLU) and the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv).

Siloam Springs Hospital Auxiliary will celebrate 50 years of serving the local hospital next month.          The auxiliary's official 50th birthday was June 27, according to Donna Conger, the current president of the auxiliary; however the auxiliary does not meet during the summer and it hosted a district meeting in the fall, according to Lesa Tucker, volunteer coordinator for Northwest Health. A private reception to celebrate the milestone will be held in February, said Tucker.          Auxiliary volunteers work throughout the hospital doing many jobs from answering the phones and greeting visitors at the information desk to assisting the radiology and surgery departments by escorting patients and guests to the correct department, to waiting rooms and to the lobby, according to the job descriptions section of the auxiliary's handbook. The auxiliary also offers scholarships to adults seeking a career in the medical field. Anyone wishing to apply for a scholarship may pick up an application at the front desk of the hospital.          The Siloam Springs Memorial Hospital Auxiliary Inc. started in 1969 with about 30 women who met at the First Methodist Church on July 22, according to a document titled "History of Siloam Springs Hospital Auxiliary." An open house was held on Aug. 17 of that year and a membership drive booth was put in the lobby of the hospital to sign up prospective members, the history states.          The hospital board appointed the first officers of the auxiliary, including Mrs. William Caudell, president; Mrs. Railey Steele, first vice president; Mrs T.W. Akins, second vice president; Mrs. Lillian Sours, recording secretary; Mrs. George Williams, corresponding secretary; and Mrs J.W. Creath, treasurer, the history states.          The auxiliary's first project involved loaning out 23 radios and 11 transistor radios to patients who requested them, the packet states. The holiday season had the volunteers making sure that each door in the hospital had a decoration and placing two Christmas trees in the lobby, the history states. The auxiliary hosted an awards luncheon in July of 1970 with 13 members receiving pins for having given 100 hours of service or more during that first year, the history states.          In 2009, the hospital was sold to Community Health Systems, a for-profit hospital chain, and a new auxiliary formed under the name Siloam Springs Hospital Auxiliary Inc., the history states.          Over the years the local auxiliary distinguished itself by being the home to several past state auxiliary presidents, including Ann Clark and Sharon Flyer according to Nancy Van Poucke, a volunteer who also runs the hospital's gift shop. In October of 2011, the auxiliary received an In-Hospital Service Award for its Lunch Tray Delivery Service Program, according to an article in the _Herald-Leader_ on Oct. 26, 2011.          When asked about the early days, Sara Treftz, who has been a member of the auxiliary since 1995, remembers a time when everyone was more like family.          "It was different," Treftz said. "Everything was real friendly. We were allowed to tell friends when somebody was in the hospital. You can talk to anybody about everything. It was a close group of people."          Riet DeGidts, who is the longest serving member of the auxiliary echoed those sentiments.          "It was easy," DeGidtz said. "We could talk about everything and everybody. It was fun. It was a family atmosphere."          DeGidts has been in the auxiliary since 1973 and was the chairwoman of the tray program. Treftz was recognized as Auxilian of the Year in 2007.

India beat New Zealand in a thrilling Super Over to win the third Twenty20 International (T20I) and register their first T20I series win in New Zealand on Wednesday. Rohit Sharma was the star for India as he smashed two sixes off last two balls in the Super Over to help India get across the finish line in a breath-taking contest. Before Rohit's magic in the Super Over, it was fast bowler Mohammed Shami who had kept India alive in the game by conceding only two runs in last five ball of the regulation play. Speaking at the post-match presentation, Indian skipper Virat Kohli accepted that half-way through the New Zealand innings he thought the match had slipped away from their hands but Shami bowled brilliantly to "turn the game on its head".                          "I thought we were gone at one stage. Shami showed his experience and put a couple of balls outside the off-stump. On the last ball, we had a discussion and we came to a conclusion that we had to hit the stumps because otherwise there is a single anyway and we are gonna lose the game. Shami went for it, got the wicket and the game turned on his head." Kohli said at the post-match presentation.                          Despite Shami's brilliant final over, the game once again seemed to drift away from India when New Zealand scored 17 runs in the Super Over but this time Rohit Sharma came to team's rescue, dispatching last two deliveries into the stands to hand India a thrilling win.                          After the game, Kohli praised Rohit for batting with great composure under pressure and getting India across the finish line with two mighty hits.                          "In the Super Over, New Zealand again put pressure on us. But Rohit was outstanding today, in the first half and in the super over. We knew, if he gets one hit, bowler will be under pressure because he is such a clean striker of the cricket ball," Kohli said praising Rohit.                          Rohit, who had earlier scored a blistering half-century, was adjudged the player of the match.                          With series already in the bag, Kohli hinted that India will look to give some game time to players like Washington Sundar and Navdeep Saini, who have only warmed the bench till now, in the next two games but at the same time will also try to clean-sweep the series.                                          *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Elazığ'ın Sivrice ilçesi merkezli 6.8 büyüklüğündeki depremde Yıldız bağları Mahallesinde misafirliğe giden 38 yaşındaki Erhan Kaplan 4 katlı binanın 2.katından aşağı atladı. 2 bacağında ve kalçasında birçok kırık bulunan Kaplan, o anda bayıldı.Çevredeki vatandaşların yardımı ile Medical Park Elazığ Hastanesine kaldırılan Kaplan tedavi altına alındı. Kaplan , yaşadıklarını İHA muhabirine anlattı.                           Düğünden çıktıklarını ifade eden Erhan Kaplan, “Arkadaşın evine oturmaya gittik.

What was initially thought to be a quick fix turned into a major undertaking, Dumas said. Part of a tree’s root system on Pine Street had pushed a six-inch pipe up causing a break and another part of the root system was wrapped around the pipe.                          “They had to cut out the roots and also cut the pipe,” Dumas said, who was with workers for a time observing the operation.                          Water valves coming into the main needed to be shut off, but some could not be shut off because of aging pipes, he said.                          “Water filled the hole,” Dumas said about the work site. Pumps were put into place, but they too failed and the Fire Department was called on to provide trucks to pump and empty the water to keep it out of the work site.                          “In the meantime, they were down in the hole, wet and cold,” Dumas said. “It was a major catastrophe.”                          Franklin Medical Center has auxiliary wells to use in the event of similar emergencies, said hospital administrator Blake Kramer. Thursday night when the water pressure went down, FMC had an issue with a pump, but Winnsboro officials made repairs in time to prevent having to get emergency repairs for FMC’s pump.                          FMC was only affected for 30 to 45 minutes and had no major problems because of the issue with the town’s water system, Kramer said.                          He also noted that he saw Dumas at the site around 6 a.m. Friday morning along with town crews.                          “He deserves to be commended,” Kramer said.                                          *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

El proyecto de bulevar de Santullano ideado en tiempos del tripartito pasa definitivamente a la historia. El Ayuntamiento ha decidido de mutuo acuerdo con la empresa rescindir el contrato con los autores del plan Bosque y Valle destinado a ordenar el acceso a la ciudad desde la autopista Y. Asi lo ha anunciado este mediodia el concejal de Urbanismo Nacho Cuesta (Cs). El Presupuesto municipal de este año reserva 225.000 euros para afrontar la rescision de este contrato, que es la cantidad acordada ahora con los arquitectos, y 200.000 euros adicionales para la puesta en marcha de un nuevo proyecto.

One feature you'll miss out on is auto-pause and resume when you take an AirPod out and put it back in your ear. It's easily one of my favorite features of AirPods, and one I sorely miss when using them on Android. The third-party app AirBattery claims to support auto-pausing as a beta feature, but only when you're playing music from Spotify, which I don't subscribe to. The app also warns you enabling the beta feature will drain your Android phone's battery faster.                                   Additionally, you won't be able to trigger Google Assistant with the AirPods, like iPhone users can do with Siri -- simply because Apple programmed its earbuds to work with its own voice assistant, not its competitor's. You'll need to start those queries the traditional way, by talking to your phone.                                   The AirPods Pro are my favorite wireless earbuds, by a long shot. But there are also plenty of worthy competitors starting to become available. We have a roundup of AirPods Pro alternatives that cost less, along with some of the best wireless earbuds that are under $100. We also have a running list of the best wireless earbuds you can buy today.                                                      *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange
