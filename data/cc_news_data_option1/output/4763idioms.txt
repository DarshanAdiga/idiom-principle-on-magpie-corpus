If you still have more faith in Giuliani and Powell than everyone who contends what they’re saying is nonsense, don’t take my word for it. Every court document that is filed in relation to the election gets posted online. DemocracyDocket.com does a good job of collecting them and posting them fairly quickly. You can read through them; everything is right there in black and white. You can see that the Trump campaign’s lawyers are not making the same claims of massive widespread fraud and voter alteration in court. Lawyers face serious professional consequences for lying -- that is, making an assertion that they know is not true, to a judge or jury -- in a courtroom. Ask yourself, if what Giuliani and Powell are claiming is true, why is the Trump campaign not even making the accusation in court? Why are they not presenting evidence? Why did Powell get angry at Tucker Carlson, who is about as supportive a media voice as the Trump campaign could ever want, when he asked for evidence? Just what did Tucker Carlson do wrong in this situation?

The past couple of months of this certainly momentous year, 2020, have demonstrated the time-honed notion that nothing defines the human spirit as significantly as its capacity for resilience; that sturdy will to endure and overcome adversity, to seek out the faint but growinglight at the end of the tunnel, and to reinvent the human experience.

Chances are that Trump will ultimately leave the White House and make way for Joe Biden, who won the presidential election fair and square. But not before Giuliani, Trump and the rest of his cronies trumpet their lies about election fraud that, moving forward, could have damaging consequences for elections both domestically and internationally.


--DocBreak--
Taken in totality, it's hard to ignore the suspicion that Giuliani -- who unabashedly tried to criminalize Black and brown people he presided over as New York City mayor -- may have been the crook all along (to international proportions, at that!). To add literal insult to metaphorical injury, now he's leading the charge to invalidate votes in cities with significant Black populations. All to keep Trump in power under false and borderline illegal bases. Is any of this really a coincidence?

Contrary to the rest of the season for the Pride, things went their way against Desert Vista. Junior quarterback Amier Boyd opened up the scoring with a 31-yard pass to senior tight end Kevin Sawitzke, who still had a cast on his left hand from a previous injury.
 As the triple-threat option in Mountain Pointe’s two-quarterback system, Boyd also made plays with his legs. In the third quarter, he helped extend Mountain Pointe’s lead with a 51-yard run in which he broke a tackle, reversed field and caught the edge on the way to the end zone.
 It was the second of two touchdowns Boyd accounted for on the night. He finished 5-of-7 through the air for 48 yards and 89 yards on the ground.
 “Everything came from the blocking,” Boyd said. “They gave us the time to look downfield and go through our progressions. Everything clicked. It seemed like we were all on the same page all game.”
 Sophomore quarterback Chris Arviso II, the other half of Mountain Pointe’s quarterback duo and the traditional pocket passer, lit up Desert Vista’s secondary in his two quarters of action.
 Arviso immediately found a rhythm in the second quarter, connecting on all six of his passes in his first drive that was capped off by a 14-yard touchdown pass to Sawitzke. Before the half, he found senior Jaden Crockett from 19 yards out.
 In the second quarter alone, Arviso threw for 110 yards and two touchdowns. He added another touchdown to Sawitzke — the senior’s third on the night — in the fourth quarter. It was a breakout performance for the sophomore, who had to sit the first four games of the season after transferring from South Mountain. He finished 18-of-22 for 205 yards, three touchdowns and an interception.

“Bites” are already established with Chef Creighton Gee-inspired menu. “Spirits” is evidenced in the 20-plus specialty craft cocktails and, in the future, their own still and distillery.
 The “Wicked,” as in “wicked smart,” was always in the vision. And Mahoney and his team are hoping Wicked Brews, Bites & Spirits will be wickedly successful.
 Learning the liquor license was approved in time for the first official weekend at the former site of Uncle Bear’s Grill & Tap was an emotional moment for Mahoney, who has been at work since signing the lease for his first solo venture Oct. 15.
 “My liquor agent sent me the approval this morning, said we’re all good,” he said.
 “I was speechless and called my wife right away. I’ve been working my butt off and we’re finally here,” he added, his voice cracking in emotion as the news hit him afresh.
 Mahoney said he hopes to have the onsite brewery up and running by late November or early December.
 The opening of Wicked Brews, Bites & Spirits is the culmination of decades of experience garnered since his first job in college with the Big Dog’s Hospitality Group in Las Vegas.
 He was their first intern and rose to be the youngest general manager in the company.
 His career curve was focused and step by step, position by position he learned while rising through the ranks of various restaurants including a six-year stint with the 12,000-square-foot TGI Fridays Front Row at Chase Field, where he served as general manager.
 Yardhouse, Scottsdale was followed by Bar Louie in Glendale and Tempe before he became minority partner and general manager at Cabin Whiskey and Grill, where he created a new craft food menu. He also required all bartenders to learn how to make the 20 new craft cocktails he’d created using old-school mixology techniques.
 Those craft cocktails, mixology and even some of his former bartenders and bar manager are present at Wicked Brews, Bites & Spirits.
 Also on staff are many others who have worked for and with Mahoney at various restaurants, several from four to nine years.
 “I have a lot of people that trust in me and I consider everyone that has stuck with me as family. When I put this together, I specifically put in that we will have a portion of profit sharing that will be in a pool so that every employee - down to the lowest level, will be in that pool and share in profits of the company,” Mahoney said.
 “They’ve all been brought up in the restaurant business and will be here helping us be successful. I’ve also hired some amazing people that will hopefully be with us for many years to come.”
 Chef Creighton Gee and Bar Manager Mikey Awalt are also long-time employees who followed Mahoney to Ahwatukee.
 Wicked Brews, Bites and Spirits is very much a family affair.

Kyle Reagon Hall, 59, of Marysville, WA, passed away on November 9, 2020, into the arms of Jesus. She was born in Everett, WA, on July 14, 1961. Kyle was a 3rd-generation Everett High graduate, class of 1979. She was a yell leader, a cheerleader and a member of TNT sorority. She remained in contact with many high school friends over the years. Growing up, Kyle was an avid bowler actively participating in bantam, junior and adult leagues, travel leagues, and tournaments. She also bowled and placed at Nationals. She enjoyed fishing with her dad, then later with her husband. She was the proud winner of the Everett Herald Fish Ladder in August of 1992, reeling in a 32 lb. white king. She was also a showcase winner on The Price is Right in 1997 and won two cars. Kyle liked watching the Mariners. A highlight of hers was when she met Jay Buhner and his handshake "gave her a chill." She also was a dedicated Seahawks fan, and was famous for her Superbowl parties that she held annually for over 30 years. Kyle worked as a checker at Olson's Foods, later to become QFC, for over 35 years, first at the Broadway and Clairmont stores in Everett, then the Stanwood store when it opened in 2003. She made many friends there, employees and customers, whom she loved. And, they adored her, with some customers waiting only for her to serve them. The number 11 was special to Kyle, so it was only fitting she married the love of her life, Justin Kevin Hall, on 11-11-11. Although they married later in life, they had known each other since their days at Carver Middle School in Everett in the '70s. Kyle was simply radiant. Her smile could light up a room. Her wit and humor were unmatched, usually resulting in crowning her the life of the party. She had a heart of gold and cared so very deeply. She was a beautiful person, inside and out. Kyle was preceded in death by her parents, Raymond and Barbara Watters, and her "step-mom", Barbara Ronnback. She is dearly loved and survived by her husband Kevin, step-daughter Renee (Justin) Crabtree, Renee's mother Patty Lemire, and mother-in-law Marjory Hall; her sister, Chris (Matt) Summers, nephews Michael Bolyard and Chad Summers, and niece Morgan Summers, as well as the Ronnback family, numerous other nephews, nieces, cousins, and friends.

County commissioners at the time took his two parcels by eminent domain, Torras said. Robert Torras fought the takings in court until voters elected a new crop of commissioners. Expanding the jail downtown was very unpopular and widely protested. New commissioners decided to demolish the old jail and shift to a site further north.


  “He spent more money than you’d imagine, all personal funds, fighting that jail being expanded there and finally got it stopped and got the whole jail moved,” Michael Torras said. “He knew if the jail was expanded there, Brunswick would never expand north.”


  Michael Torras drew parallels to the efforts of his great-grandfather, F.J. Torras, who worked to get the F.J. Torras Causeway to St. Simons Island built.


  “So here’s my grandfather doing something similar for downtown, seeing this large, impossible feat of moving this government building,” Michael Torras said. “He put five to seven years, all of his personal business aside, all of our companies got put on the back burner, and he went headlong into getting this jail moved.”


  Coleman got little support for his proposal to rename the veterans park at a Tuesday commission meeting, however.


  Opponents said, among other things, that naming a park dedicated to all who served after one veteran would be disrespectful to other veterans and that forcing the issue would divide the community. Only two commissioners, Coleman and Allen Booker, supported the proposal, along with Brunswick Mayor Cornell Harvey, outgoing state Rep. Jeff Jones and outgoing Sen. William Ligon.


  The county commission will discuss the renaming proposal again on Dec. 3.


  Coleman asks that anyone with an opinion on the matter to send their thoughts to commissioners@glynncounty-ga.gov in advance of the meeting.

A new-look FC Goa, strengthened with the addition of new foreign players and a new head coach, will begin their Indian Super League campaign with a new vigour when they clash with formidable Bengaluru FC, here on Sunday.


  FC Goa have never won the coveted ISL trophy and would be hoping that this time around they go one step forward than 2018 and 2015 seasons, when they emerged as runners-up.


  But it won't be an easy task for coach Juan Ferrando, who wants the club to continue playing attacking brand of football, which they also played under their previous coach Sergio Lobera.


  "We would continue to play attacking brand of football, playing the game on the front foot. That is the philosophy of the club and that is what really attracted me to the job. It is aligned with the kind of football I believe in," Ferrando said.


  FC Goa, who won the League Winners Shield last season to become the first side from India to qualify for the group stage of the AFC Champions League, have parted ways with the likes of star forwards Ferran Corominas and Hugo Boumous who have established themselves as feared goal scorers in the ISL over the years.


  They have added a few quality players, both domestic and foreign, and their familiarity with the home conditions will come handy in their bid to at least reach the play-offs stage.


  FC Goa would bank on their Spanish lethal striker Igor Angulo proves his mettle right from the beginning.


  The coach has options in other forwards like Aaren D'Silva, Devendra Murgaonkar, Ishan Pandita and Makan Chothe, to choose from, to support Angulo.


  But Goa has an array of strong mid-fielders, the prominent among being skipper Edu Bedia, who can decide the fate of the game.


  Also, the likes of India international Brandon Fernandes, Lenny Rodrigues, Albert Noguera, and Jorge Ortiz, will have to play their role as feeders.


  The departure of utility mid-fielders like Ahmed Jahouh and Hugo Boumous, would put more pressure on Noguera, who will have to establish himself as a link between Bedia and Angulo.


  Then there are defenders Ivan Gonzalez and James Donachie apart from other local defenders to man the line and thwart the opposition attack.


  On the other hand, Bengaluru, who have won the ISL once, would also be hoping for a winning start and contribution of star striker Sunil Chhetri would be the key.


  The Bengaluru team boasts of a well-rounded unit and will be a tough opponent first up.


  The prolific Chhetri can turn a game on its head single handedly and with a strong support cast, BFC will be hard to beat.


  Another important cog in BFC's wheel is experienced custodian Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, who kept the record of 11 clean-sheets last season. His role would be equally important as that of Chhetri.


  Bengaluru are also expected to play key strikers Cleiton Silva, Kristian Opseth.

Let’s face it, this year has been a struggle for so many people in more ways than one. Thoughts of kids, the holidays and wondering how to provide for them may also be weighing heavily on many. But take heart, Santa and the Postal Service are way ahead of you, and are here to help.
 The USPS Operation Santa program celebrates its 108th year in 2020 by opening up for nationwide participation. Now, more than ever, the program is needed to help less fortunate kids and families during the holidays.
 The Postal Service established the USPS Operation Santa program to help those in need at the holidays experience the joy of opening presents — and to create special holiday memories. Since it began, millions of less fortunate children and their families have been helped by the kindness of others. The program is for every person of every belief, or non-belief. The purpose is to help as many deserving families as possible. And that can only be done if good-hearted adopters step forward.
 To participate in the USPS Operation Santa program as a possible recipient of holiday gifts, all you have to do is write a letter, put it in a stamped envelope with a return address, and send it to Santa’s official workshop address as seen on the example envelope below. Letters will be accepted Nov. 16 – Dec. 15.
 Program Details
 Hundreds of thousands of letters are written to the USPS Operation Santa program every year in hopes of being adopted by kind and generous people across the country. These letters are opened by Santa's Elves and, for safety reasons, all personally identifiable information of the letter writer is removed (i.e. last names, addresses, ZIP Codes) and uploaded to USPSOperationSanta.com for adoption.
 Beginning Dec. 4, letters will be available for nationwide adoption by visiting USPSOperationSanta.com -- all from the socially distant safety of your own home. Potential adopters can read the letters and pick one, or more, that they'd like to fulfill. For security reasons, potential adopters must be vetted by going through a short registration and ID verification process before they are allowed to adopt any letter.
 Companies also help adopt letters. Every year many companies create teams and adopt several letters. All the better to help grant that special wish to deserving families and kids.
 How to Write a Letter
 Sending a letter to Santa is easy if you know how. The Postal Service is here to help with guides and tips to help kids write and send their best letters ever. All the information you could possibly need to write a letter, address an envelope, put on a stamp and send it on its way can be found on USPSOperationSanta.com and in our Holiday Newsroom. The only thing the Postal Service can't help with is to tell kids what to ask for. That is up to their imagination, and we would never stifle creativity. These tips are also good all year-round for sending thank-you cards, birthday cards, or letters to Grandma and Grandpa just to say, "Hi."
 USPS Operation Santa History
 While the Postal Service began receiving letters to Santa more than 108 years ago, it wasn’t until 1912 that Postmaster General Frank Hitchcock authorized local Postmasters to allow postal employees and citizens to respond to them. This became known as Operation Santa.
 The complete history can be found online at the Postal Service Holiday Newsroom, along with additional news and information, including all domestic, international and military mailing and shipping deadlines.
 The Postal Service receives no tax dollars for operating expenses and relies on the sale of postage, products and services to fund its operations.

Petrol price on Saturday was hiked by 15 paise per litre and diesel by 20 paise, the second straight day of increase in rates after firming international oil rates broke nearly a two-month-long hiatus in price revision.


  The price of petrol in Delhi was hiked to Rs 81.38 per litre from Rs 81.23, according to a notification from oil marketing companies.


  Diesel rates went up from Rs 70.68 to Rs 70.88 per litre.


  On Friday, petrol price was raised by 17 paise per litre and diesel by 22 paise.


   


   


  This is the first revision in petrol prices since September 22. Diesel rates had not changed since October 2.


  Public sector oil marketing companies - Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd - revise rates of petrol and diesel daily based on benchmark international oil price and foreign exchange rate.


  They have, however, resorted to calibrating the rates since the pandemic broke out with a view to avoiding volatility in retail prices.


  The 58-day hiatus in petrol price revision and the 48-day status quo on diesel rates were preceded by no change in rates between June 30 and August 15 and a 85-day status quo between March 17 and June 6.


  In Mumbai, the petrol price on Friday was raised to Rs 88.09 per litre from Rs 87.92, while diesel rates went up from Rs 77.11 to Rs 77.34.


  Rates vary from state to state depending on the incidence of local sales tax or VAT.

Petrol price on Saturday was hiked by 15 paise per litre and diesel by 20 paise, the second straight day of increase in rates after firming international oil rates broke nearly a two-month-long hiatus in price revision. The price of petrol in Delhi was hiked to Rs 81.38 per litre from Rs 81.23, according to a notification from oil marketing companies. Diesel rates went up from Rs 70.68 to Rs 70.88 per litre. On Friday, petrol price was raised by 17 paise per litre and diesel by 22 paise. This is the first revision in petrol prices since September 22. Diesel rates had not changed since October 2. Public sector oil marketing companies - Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd - revise rates of petrol and diesel daily based on benchmark international oil price and foreign exchange rate. They have, however, resorted to calibrating the rates since the pandemic broke out with a view to avoiding volatility in retail prices. The 58-day hiatus in petrol price revision and the 48-day status quo on diesel rates were preceded by no change in rates between June 30 and August 15 and a 85-day status quo between March 17 and June 6. In Mumbai, the petrol price on Friday was raised to Rs 88.09 per litre from Rs 87.92, while diesel rates went up from Rs 77.11 to Rs 77.34. Rates vary from state to state depending on the incidence of local sales tax or VAT.

A new-look FC Goa, strengthened with the addition of new foreign players and a new head coach, will begin their Indian Super League campaign with a new vigour when they clash with formidable Bengaluru FC, here on Sunday.


  FC Goa have never won the coveted ISL trophy and would be hoping that this time around they go one step forward than 2018 and 2015 seasons, when they emerged as runners-up.


  But it won't be an easy task for coach Juan Ferrando, who wants the club to continue playing attacking brand of football, which they also played under their previous coach Sergio Lobera.


  "We would continue to play attacking brand of football, playing the game on the front foot. That is the philosophy of the club and that is what really attracted me to the job. It is aligned with the kind of football I believe in," Ferrando said.


   


   


  FC Goa, who won the League Winners Shield last season to become the first side from India to qualify for the group stage of the AFC Champions League, have parted ways with the likes of star forwards Ferran Corominas and Hugo Boumous who have established themselves as feared goal scorers in the ISL over the years.


  They have added a few quality players, both domestic and foreign, and their familiarity with the home conditions will come handy in their bid to at least reach the play-offs stage.


  FC Goa would bank on their Spanish lethal striker Igor Angulo proves his mettle right from the beginning.


  The coach has options in other forwards like Aaren D'Silva, Devendra Murgaonkar, Ishan Pandita and Makan Chothe, to choose from, to support Angulo.


  But Goa has an array of strong mid-fielders, the prominent among being skipper Edu Bedia, who can decide the fate of the game.


  Also, the likes of India international Brandon Fernandes, Lenny Rodrigues, Albert Noguera, and Jorge Ortiz, will have to play their role as feeders.


  The departure of utility mid-fielders like Ahmed Jahouh and Hugo Boumous, would put more pressure on Noguera, who will have to establish himself as a link between Bedia and Angulo.


  Then there are defenders Ivan Gonzalez and James Donachie apart from other local defenders to man the line and thwart the opposition attack.


  On the other hand, Bengaluru, who have won the ISL once, would also be hoping for a winning start and contribution of star striker Sunil Chhetri would be the key.


  The Bengaluru team boasts of a well-rounded unit and will be a tough opponent first up.


  The prolific Chhetri can turn a game on its head single handedly and with a strong support cast, BFC will be hard to beat.


  Another important cog in BFC's wheel is experienced custodian Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, who kept the record of 11 clean-sheets last season. His role would be equally important as that of Chhetri.


  Bengaluru are also expected to play key strikers Cleiton Silva, Kristian Opseth.

Rohit also spoke about his enduring relationship with his IPL franchise Mumbai Indians. The five-time champions, he said, were not created overnight.      "Yeah, we have a ( _Kieron_ ) Pollard, a Hardik ( _Pandya_ ), ( _Jasprit_ ) Bumrah but has anybody thought why this team is successful?" he asked.      "Lot of people, I hear say that can he ( _Rohit_ ) do it with other teams? Firstly, why shall I need to do it with other teams? There is a certain way this franchise wants to go and same direction I want to go as well, both as a player and leader," he explained.      "Did this team become good overnight? No. It's just that this franchise doesn't believe in chopping and changing. And every player, including Rohit Sharma, was available (2011) at auctions. Just that Mumbai Indians picked and believed in building a team."      He was extremely proud of Mumbai Indians getting New Zealand pacer Trent Boult on board, which worked wonders for them. Boult was released by Delhi Capitals before the players auction, a decision that they would probably regret given how effective he was this year.      "Trent Boult was with Delhi last year and before that with Sunrisers. We needed someone to provide wickets upfront and who could swing the ball," Rohit said.      "We strongly pursued him and got him from Capitals, something I am proud of."      It was a tough year on all counts but Rohit said the franchise provided an environment that created memories of a lifetime while being locked in a bio- bubble due to the COVID-19 pandemic.      "Mumbai Indians in a year where everything was uncertain, created a happy space for us. 80 days in a bio-bubble never felt claustrophobic. Every little aspect was taken care of and the preparation started in June in a bio-secure environment with all net bowlers and Indian players," he said.      Rohit also touched upon his IPL leadership and spoke about the freedom he gives his players by letting them evolve as individuals. He cited Suryakumar Yadav's composure while dealing with India rejection as an example.      "We were sitting in our team room and I could feel he was dejected. But I didn't go and speak to him. It was he who came up and said, 'Don't worry I will get over it and win the matches for Mumbai Indians'.      "And when he said that I also realised he is heading in right direction not only in terms of IPL but in his overall career. There are a lot of India games and his time will come.      "If you ask me, my philosophy is mind over matter and that's what works for me."

Petrol price on Saturday was hiked by 15 paise per litre and diesel by 20 paise, the second straight day of increase in rates after firming international oil rates broke nearly a two-month-long hiatus in price revision.

  Diesel rates went up from Rs 70.68 to Rs 70.88 per litre.


  On Friday, petrol price was raised by 17 paise per litre and diesel by 22 paise.


  This is the first revision in petrol prices since September 22. Diesel rates had not changed since October 2.

  Trenton Johnson broke off a 20-yard touchdown run to stake MCA back to a touchdown lead 21-14, and he reached the end zone again in the opening minute of the fourth quarter from seven yards out to make it a two-score advantage.


  Johnson, the second-leading rusher in the classification, put the finishing touches on the game with a 20-yard scoring run with around five minutes remaining.
