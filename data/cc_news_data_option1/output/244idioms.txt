I have a toad with a disability. My brother Kevin found him in a parking lot, saw that he was injured, and called me. "Bring him over," I said. The poor little guy was bleeding on one side of his head. I discovered later that he was missing his left eye, and I very uncreatively named him Harry The One-Eyed American Toad. I nursed him back to health and now he's a member of the family and an ambassador for his species.
 However, I don't advocate that people keep wild animals as pets.
 It's a lot of work, for one thing. Harry eats only live prey, so I have to keep crickets on hand at all times, and I have to feed and take care of those crickets. I have to clean his habitat and be very careful when I handle him. In captivity, Harry could live quite a long time, perhaps 10 years, which means I am in it for the long haul.
 Some animals, especially mammals and birds, take care of their young. If you remove one from the wild, you may be taking a mother or father away from their family. All animals have complex lives and very specific needs for habitat, temperature, moisture and more. Harry needs access to water at all times, places to burrow, and plenty of room to roam. Many critters live in communities in the wild, so it wouldn't be good to keep one isolated.
 Finally, Massachusetts has strict laws around which animals can be taken from the wild. American toads can be, but the vast majority of critters can not.
 If you find an injured animal and you want to help, you have options. You can call your animal control officer or reach out to a licensed wildlife rehabilitator. On the Mass Wildlife site, they are listed along with information about which kinds of animals they handle. Keep the phone numbers of a few rehabilitators in your glove compartment or wallet.
 Shortly after I got Harry, he burrowed out of sight and showed no sign of coming up. I got advice from a rehabilitator who knows about toads. Burrowing is normal for him, but I can't let him go into hibernation because I can't duplicate the conditions he would have in the wild. So, even in the winter and much to his chagrine, I roust him out after a day or two.
 When I tell people I have a toad as a pet, pretty much across the board they say, "Um, why?" I love watching him capture a cricket in his mouth and then use his hand to stuff it all in. I love waking up in the middle of the night and hearing him rustling around in the leaves in his habitat.
 By the way, there's one other thing I have to do for Harry--protect him from The Hooligan Sisters, my two cats who would just love to have him for a snack.

Reclassified as a junior, the 6-foot-2, 175-pound guard is back, averaging 10.4 points, 2.9 rebounds and 2.8 assists for Torrey Pines (14-4), the No. 4-ranked team in the county.
 “Honestly, it’s a miracle,” said Torrey Pines coach John Olive. “Not only that he’s playing basketball, but that he’s walking.
 “There was nerve damage in the leg. He had drop foot. He was white and pasty, didn’t look well at all. So now to be playing at a high level is truly amazing.”
 Nick started treatment in September 2018. In January 2019, his mother, Nicole Elliott Herrmann, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and underwent surgery.
 “My whole life was taking care of Nick,” said Nicole, a college tennis player at Cal and now a nurse at Rady Children’s Hospital. “I was at his side nearly round the clock.
 “Then, suddenly, I was in one hospital (Sharp Memorial) and he was in another.
 “My daughter (Anna) was 16, and it was very hard on her. It was an awful year of treatments.
 “We still have scans and testing, and it’s day-to-day. But we’re both in the clear now.”

Consumers especially in developed markets are growing keener towards the consumption of plant based food, which is a chief driver of the global plant protein market. Given the scenario, an increasing number of food and beverage companies are incorporating plant protein in products. This trend is fuelled by the rising preference towards plants as a source of protein in the U.S. With the increasing demand for non-meat food and non-dairy beverages, the plant protein market is currently witnessing lucrative growth prospects. Consuming plant protein can help in the reduction of saturated fats, thereby curbing the incidence of cholesterol and allergic reactions from dairy products and eggs.

SPRINGFIELD - Illinois farmers will get a much-needed lift from two international trade agreements approved by the federal government this week, but experts are uncertain if their situations will improve in the long term.
 After exchanging hundreds of billions of dollars of tariffs for more than a year, the U.S. and Chinese governments agreed to the first part of trade deal on Wednesday.
 On Thursday, Congress passed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, better known as USMCA, sending it to President Donald Trump to sign.
 The average Illinoisan will likely not be much affected by the deals, experts say. Instead, the largest beneficiaries will be corn and soybean farmers who have been caught in President Trump's trade conflicts with China and Mexico since 2018.
 A cautious step forward
 Illinois farmers have been especially hurt by China's retaliatory tariffs in the ongoing U.S.-China trade war, forcing the federal government to issue $28 billion in aid nationwide.
 Wednesday's trade agreement with China, however, is more of a ceasefire than a peace agreement, said Jonathan Coppess, director of the Gardner Agriculture Policy Program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
 "Really what it does is kind of stop the damage that was initiated with this tariff conflict that that the president started," he said.
 The deal should play out in two phases. Phase One, which began Wednesday, requires China to purchase $200 billion in U.S. goods over the next two years, including $32 billion of agricultural products.
 Chief among them are soybeans and pork, in which Illinois ranks first and fourth, respectively, in U.S. production.
 American soybean exports to China dropped 75 percent between 2017 and 2018, as China bought soybeans from other countries while exchanging tariffs with the U.S.
 President Trump, however, said he will not lift America's $360 billion of tariffs on Chinese goods until Phase Two is negotiated and implemented.
 "We see this as a sign of brighter days to come," Illinois Soybean Growers President Doug Schroeder said in a statement. However, he added, "A long- awaited win for the soybean industry will come when the soybean tariffs are fully rescinded."
 Unfortunately, that could be awhile, said Todd Hubbs, a professor of agriculture economics at UIUC.
 "It doesn't sound like Phase Two is going to get done anytime soon," Hubbs said, because U.S. leadership could change after November's presidential election.
 "I don't think there's any desire on either side right now to ruin the deal, … (but) I don't see it happening before the election," he said.
 Carson Varner, a professor of international business at Illinois State University who also owns soybean land, says farmers like him are willing to suffer in only the short term.
 "We'd much rather make our money selling soybeans" than receiving tariff aid, he said.
 Varner is hopeful, though, that China and the U.S. can strike a deal. He predicts Phase Two will also allow Illinois to export more pork and agriculture equipment.
 "(Trump) knows how to negotiate," Varner said. "I think he told the Chinese he's willing to walk away from a bad deal, and so I am optimistic that this thing is going to move forward."
 USMCA helps corn farmers, hurts car buyers
 Despite President Trump calling the USMCA "one of the biggest trade bills ever made," not much has actually changed from its beginnings as the Clinton-era North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Coppess said.
 "We're not talking about major reform of the trade agreement," Coppess said. "If anything, the president has his trade agreement, so we can be assured at least for his time in office that maybe he won't threaten these trading partners again."
 The agreement mostly reinforces trade the U.S. already does with Canada and Mexico, especially corn, of which Mexico is America's top buyer and Illinois is America's second-most producer.
 "Every step toward USMCA passage is cause for celebration," Illinois Corn Growers Association President Bill Leigh said in a statement.
 The USMCA also increases U.S. dairy exports to Canada, but that will impact more dairy-heavy states like Wisconsin.
 Both U.S. senators from Illinois, Democrats Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, voted for the bill.
 In statements, Durbin applauded its "bipartisan" support, while Duckworth said it "works for farmers and manufacturers and features enforceable labor standards to support American workers."
 Duckworth added, however, the deal "is not perfect" because it does not tackle climate change. But Varner argues enforcing U.S. environmental standards on Mexico is demanding too much.
 "Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good," he said.
 One negative for regular Illinoisans is that the USMCA could increase the prices of new cars, because it ups the percentage of North American auto parts that vehicles must have to avoid tariffs.
 Because companies often pass on increased production costs and losses from tariffs to consumers, the average American could see car prices increase between $470 and $2,200, according to the Center for Automotive Research.
 Varner argues, however, the USMCA's requirements regarding auto parts and higher wage standards are designed to spur investment in the U.S. and increase domestic manufacturing.
 "I think it would cost a lot more if we abandon these deals," he said.
 President Trump is expected to sign the USMCA next week. Mexico approved it last year, while Canada is expected to approve it later this year to officially make it binding.

 Hewitt was industrious in the middle, but it was Roberts - who has played close to 100 Super League games - who caught the eye in the second half, making a series of telling contributions, crowned with the winning try from Scott Grix’s pass.
 “Oli’s a solid back rower, a big lad with a decent amount of skill about him,” said Grix.

The one weakness on the 49ers defense of late has been cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon, who has been picked on repeatedly as teams avoid Richard Sherman. Witherspoon has allowed all five TD passes given up by San Francisco the past three games and was benched for Emmanuel Moseley in the first quarter last week after getting beaten for a 41-yard TD by Stefon Diggs. Shanahan hasn’t said what his plan is for this week, but it seems likely Moseley will get the nod after faring well in nine games as a starter earlier this season when Witherspoon was hurt.

Reliever John Brebbia marveled at what Flaherty accomplished in 2019.
 “It was almost surreal, even being in the bullpen as far away as I am. You watch how he did in the second half and you think no one’s ever been this good,” Brebbia said. “They couldn’t have because this was as good as it gets. If you get to see him and how he prepares every day and what is attitude is every day towards the game of baseball, if you had to peg one person for being the best pitcher you’ve ever seen in that second half, it’s going to be him. There’s no getting around his drive and his consistency and how well he prepares for each outing.”
 Trying to match those numbers is not what motivates Flaherty.
 “I don’t think it’s about going higher. It’s just about trying to stay consistent,” Flaherty said. “I want to take the same approach day in and day out and not try to do anything more.”
 Gibson is not the only one Flaherty credits with helping him become a better pitcher.
 “We’re really lucky coming up as young guys to have a guy like Yadi (Molina) catching us,” Flaherty said. “To have a guy like Adam Wainwright on the staff. To have a guy like Chris Carpenter coming around. To have, at least for myself, to have Bob Gibson coming around. We’re really lucky to have those people around to have them be so willing and open to having conversations and wanting to help you grow and get comfortable. That really rubs off on you.”
 A death of a close friend fueled Flaherty’s rise in the second half of the season. Flaherty’s friend Tyler Skaggs, a 27-year-old Angels pitcher, died July 1. Skagg’s death was ruled an accident while under the influence of drugs and alcohol.
 Flaherty and Skaggs were both from California. The two worked out together in the offseason.

MILFORD - On Saturday, January 25th the Columns Museum will host a dinner and program that will focus on the life and times of the people who operated canal boats and the effect of the canal in the small communities along the Lackawaxen River and D & H Canal during the heydays of the canal's use.
   
 Down from Honesdale and into Pike County, sleepy towns such as Kimbles, Baoba, Baisdenville, Glen Eyre and Rowlands all played a part in the history of a unique canal system which meandered through these parts, making life on the canal, and on its banks, worth recalling.
   
 While the canal itself was certainly an engineering marvel in many ways, the life of a canaller was just as unique. In some cases, life on board was a family affair with mother and children along for the ride. A small cabin below deck housed the boat's operators and had a bunk, stove and table and chairs to add a home like feel to the journey. The primary cargo was coal; but often other items were transported - especially in the Pike County area - as it was an easier means of moving large items than along the primitive roads. Passengers, and animals could be found upon the boats as well.
   
 Life wasn't always easy, as you could imagine; and an ongoing rivalry with the raftsmen could make for some dicey exchanges along the way.
   
 The Delaware and Hudson Canal Company operated its 108 mile canal from 1828 to 1898. Coal was brought by gravity railroad to meet the boats at Honesdale; another gravity railroad brought coal to Hawley. The canal ended at Rondout, nor Kingston, NY on the Hudson River where the coal was transferred to barges.
   
 Canal songs, exhibit
   
 The Museum will unveil a new exhibit honoring the D &H; Canal on the 25th of January and will host a "Canal Days" dinner at 6 p.m. which will feature a presentation of canal songs by Dan Engvaldsen combined with a delightful pot roast dinner, "mule races" and general good cheer.
   
 Each table of 6-8 will be hosted by a Pike County Historical Society (PCHS) Board Member who will be your "boat captain" for the evening. The themed tables will be a unique creation of the tables' hostess, and your meal will be enjoyed family style, reminiscent of Sunday dinners on the Morris Canal, which had its origins in nearby Phillipsburg, NJ - just across the river from Easton, Pa.
   
 The Columns Museum is located at 608 Broad St., Milford.
   
 The cost for the event is $40 per person and includes dinner, dessert, libation, and entertainment. Reservations are mandatory and can be obtained by calling 570-296-8126 or emailing pikemuse@ptd.net.

Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je (柯文哲), chairman of the Taiwan People’s Party (TPP), on Saturday said that the party’s rules for removing legislators-at-large only meet the lowest standards.
 Ko made the remark in Helsinki in response to a Taiwanese reporter’s questions.
 The TPP won five legislator-at-large seats in the Jan. 11 elections, and is eligible to form a legislative caucus, which requires at least three legislators from the same party.
 The TPP on Saturday invited legislative watchdog Citizen’s Congress Watch (CCW) to educate the party’s five new legislators.
 TPP Secretary-General Chang Jer-yang (張哲揚) said that the party’s legislators- at-large would be removed if they are listed on the CCW’s “watch” list for two consecutive legislative sessions, breach the TPP caucus’ decision on important personnel appointments once or breach the caucus’ decision on important bills three times.
 “The rules are for regulating our legislators,” he said.
 We hope the rules protect their original reasons for entering politics from being contaminated, and prevent them from holding values contrary to the party’s, Chang said.
 When asked to comment on the rules, Ko said “there should be an accreditation system for our lawmakers ... and the three rules mentioned are of the lowest standards.”
 The TPP should establish its own evaluation standards, but for now it would use the CCW’s, he said.
 Legislators could easily get a good score if they are not absent from committee meetings and question-and-answer sessions, and if they propose bills, so the party might institute higher standards, Ko added.
 The TPP, which was established by Ko in August last year, emerged as the country’s third-largest party after Saturday’s legislative elections.

 ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Florida International's James Morgan led two first- quarter scoring drives and Charlotte's Benny LeMay rushed for two touchdowns to lead the East to a 31-27 victory in the East-West Shrine Bowl on Saturday.
 LeMay's 9-yard TD run with just under two minutes remaining sealed offensive MVP honors for the 5-foot-8, 216-pound running back in the nation's longest- running college football all-star game, which was played at Tropicana Field.
 Morgan started at quarterback for the East and shared playing time with Princeton's Kevin Davidson and Mississippi State's Tommy Stevens, who led his team downfield for the winning TD after the West took a 27-24 lead on James Robinson's 63-yard scoring run.
 Robinson, who rushed for 1,899 yards and 18 touchdowns for Illinois State this season, finished with 80 yards rushing on seven attempts. He gained an additional 56 yards on two pass receptions, one a 46-yarder that led to a field goal.
 Utah's Tyler Huntley threw a 7-yard TD pass to San Diego State tight end Parker Houston and North Texas' Mason Fine tossed a 36-yard scoring pass to Ohio State's Binjimon Victor to help the West wipe out an early two-touchdown deficit and make it 17-all heading into the fourth quarter.
 Morgan, meanwhile, continued to state his case as a potential pick in the NFL draft by completing 9 of 14 passes for 116 yards, including a 9-yard TD throw to Louisiana's Ja'Marcus Bradley to finish the East's game-opening drive.
 Navy wide receiver Macolm Perry took a direct snap from center and sprinted 52 yards for a TD on his only carry. Versatile UCF running back Adrian Killins Jr. had only one rushing attempt but led the East with seven catches for 91 yards, including a 37-yard reception on the game-winning drive.
 Stevens also had an 18-yard completion to Rhode Island's Aaron Parker to set up LeMay's second touchdown.

 NEW ORLEANS (AP) \" ExhibitBE came to a triumphant close on Martin Luther King Day, five years ago. Some of the original murals that crowded the walls of the derelict five-story DeGaulle Manor apartment building are still intact, though some have been tagged over or altered. The building itself is still a sprawling unoccupied shell, sprouting weeds and strewn with trash, old mattresses and other debris. The hazardous site is no longer open to the public.
 ExhibitBE (sometimes spelled Exhibit Be) remains the most important New Orleans artwork of the 21st-century. Brandon 'bmike' Odums, the 29-year-old mastermind behind the project, billed it as the largest street art exhibit in the American South. But it came to represent much more.
 The random collision of dozens of enormous artworks by area graffiti writers and street artists transformed the forlorn architecture into a collaborative surrealist masterpiece that no museum could contain. More importantly, Odums' portraits of civil rights heroes from Harriet Tubman to Martin Luther King Jr. to Muhammad Ali, made it a Crescent City icon of the Black Lives Matter movement.
 Though the DeGaulle Manor had closed before Hurricane Katrina, the ruined building tapped into the post-flood gestalt perfectly. It symbolized the displacement of much of the population, particularly of lower-income African Americans.
 During the creation of ExhibitBE, Odums said that it was very characteristic of New Orleans to change a blighted environment into something beautiful.
 'Whether it's the food, the music, the jazz funerals, we find ways to make something out of nothing. That's true to street art. That's true to graffiti in general. That's true to hip hop in general, but I feel like New Orleans has always done it with a certain effortlessness.'
 When ExhibitBE was created in 2014, thousands made a pilgrimage to the desolate site to see the wild, monumental artwork and acknowledge all it represented. Erykah Badu sang at the official closing of the show. Odums, a NOCCA grad and former UNO student, instantly became a New Orleans star.
 As he planned the big project, Odums said he'd been advised that it would be impossible to get the 'lone wolves' of the graffiti scene to cooperate. Happily, the paint-spattered renegades must have recognized that the moment had come to prove once and for all that graffiti was the most important contemporary visual art form.
 'I'm happy for what it represented; what can happen when the community and creative people come together,' said Odums in a recent telephone conversation.
 Odums said he's not surprised that some of the original art has been painted over.
 'That's the natural organic lifespan of street art,' he said. 'That's to be expected.'
 One of the most striking images in all of ExhibitBE was Odums' haunting 50-foot painting of a teenage murder victim. In recent years, someone has replaced the realistic eyes in Odums' mega-portrait with cartoonishly doleful eyes that turn what was poignant into something maudlin. Odums said he thinks the face may have been altered for a movie shoot.
 His magnificent suite of portraits in the apartment complex's former rec room remain untouched.
 The fate of the deteriorating apartment complex, which is owned by Granaio LLC, according to the New Orleans Assessor's office website, is unknown. Odums has moved on to other projects, such as his current solo exhibit at the Newcomb Art Museum on the Tulane University campus.
 Looking back on ExhibitBE after five years, he was a bit rueful.
 'If anyone can go back to their younger self, they'd see they had a lot more courage. There was a lot of fearlessness in that moment.'

Ballard is starting to mold itself into a top-five team in Class 4A girls' basketball.
   
 With Thursday's 48-25 victory at Winterset, the Bombers have won 11 in a row after a season-opening 52-45 loss to fifth-ranked Gilbert. They are on track for another Raccoon River Conference title, having won all six of their conference games.
   
 Two big reasons for that success are junior guard Josie Fleischmann and sophomore forward Meg Rietz.
   
 Guards Molly Ihle and Brooke Loewe have been the engine driving the Bomber machine, combining to average 20.1 points, 9.4 assists, 9.2 rebounds and 7.1 steals per game. Senior forward Maggie Larson has been a defensive stalwart that also averages 6.8 points and 3.0 rebounds and junior center Cassidy Thompson is blocking nearly three shots per game.
   
 But Fleischmann and Rietz have helped Ballard take it to the next level since the Gilbert loss.
   
 Fleischmann, Ballard's leading scorer at 11.8 points per game, is having a historic season shooting from outside. She has made 40 of 74 shots from behind the arc, an incredible 54.1-percent success rate.
   
 "I've never had anybody quite hit that percentage before from the 3-point line," Ballard coach Kelly Andeson said. "It's a nice weapon to have."
   
 Fleischmann ranks second in 4A in 3-point percentage among players with more than 10 makes. She leads everyone in 4A with at least 20 3-pointers, earning big praise from her teammates.
   
 "I am a happy little best friend," Ihle said. "She's been working hard in the offseason. It's paid off."
   
 Ballard runs a lot of motion offense with Ihle and Loewe constantly driving to draw attention from opposing defenses and then kicking it out. Fleischmann has taken full advantage of her opportunities.
   
 "My teammates work really hard to get everybody open looks," Fleischmann said. "When they work so hard to get you an open look you've got to make it."
   
 Fleischmann also has the right mentality to excel as a shooter.
   
 "At Carlisle last week when we were there she airballed the first one and then she hit the next three or four in a row," Anderson said. "That's just how she is."
   
 Fleischmann ended up making 5 of 7 3-pointers and scoring 15 points in a 64-30 victory over the Wildcats. She is 18 of 35 on 3-pointers after Christmas break and is averaging 12.6 points in that stretch.
   
 Rietz has also come on since returning from break.
   
 Ballard's top weapon off the bench, Rietz is averaging 5.8 points, 3.8 rebounds and 2.4 steals since Christmas. That is a nice bump from her 4.4, 1.3 and 2.3 averages before the break.
   
 "We've had a lot of faith in her for some time," Anderson said. "As a freshman she was timid, like most freshmen are. We kept telling her if she can get past that part of it and start playing a little more tough and a little more aggressive she can be as good as she wants to be and she's starting to show that."
   
 Rietz broke out with eight points and five rebounds in a 48-38 victory over a North Polk team then ranked No. 1 in 3A during Ballard's first game back from break on Jan. 3. She scored a season-high 10 points in a 36-25 victory over Carroll last Tuesday.
   
 "We're working really well together and they're passing me the ball and getting it out so that I can drive," Rietz said. "I think that creates a lot more shots. Some offenses are stagnant whereas we're moving and that's made it easier for me to drive in and score points."
   
 At 6-0 with a 3-point touch and good ball skills, Rietz does a little bit of everything for Ballard.
   
 "Meg's a little Harden," Ihle said referring to Houston Rockets' star James Harden. "She's so shifty."
   
 She and senior Rachel Wohlgemuth are also counted on to give the team a big energy boost coming off the bench.
   
 "When we're having an off game and we're not doing well the bench is what keeps us going," Fleischmann siad.
   
 That was never more evident than during Ballard's victory over Carroll.
   
 The Bomber offense was having no success for most of the first half. Rietz came in and scored her team's first six points to hold the fort until Fleischmann got hot and then Ballard started to get some separation in the second half.
   
 Being able to give her team a needed spark is something Rietz has mixed feelings about due to her unselfish nature.
   
 "I like it and I don't like it," Rietz said. "I like it because I get to play, but I don't like it because it means my team isn't doing well and I obviously want the best for my team."
   
 But her success has been what's best for Ballard in recent weeks. And there is more to come.
   
 "She's not there yet," Anerson said. "But man she's made big strides."

Berlin, Jan 20 (AFP) World leaders committed Sunday to ending all foreign meddling in Libya's war and to uphold a weapons embargo at a Berlin summit, as part of a broader plan to end the spiralling conflict. The presidents of Russia, Turkey and France were among global chiefs signing up to the plan to stop interfering in the war -- be it through weapons, troops or financing.
 But the talks failed to deliver "serious dialogue" between the warring parties -- strongman Khalifa Haftar and the head of Tripoli's UN-recognised government Fayez al-Sarraj -- or to get both sides to sign up to a permanent truce. "We have a very disparate situation in Libya, where ensuring that a ceasefire is immediately respected is simply not easy to guarantee," said summit host Chancellor Angela Merkel.
 "But I hope that through today's conference, we have a chance the truce will hold further." Libya has been torn by fighting between rival armed factions since a 2011 NATO-backed uprising killed dictator Moamer Kadhafi.
 Most recently, Sarraj's troops in Tripoli have been under attack since April from Haftar's forces. Clashes have killed more than 280 civilians and 2,000 fighters and displaced tens of thousands, until a fragile ceasefire backed by both Ankara and Moscow was put in place on January 12.
 Although Sarraj's government is recognised by the UN, powerful players have broken away to stand behind Haftar -- turning a domestic conflict into what some have described as a proxy war in which international powers jostle to secure their own interests. International alarm grew in recent weeks after Turkey ordered in troops to shore up Sarraj's government.
 For UN chief Antonio Guterres, the Libya conflict had spiralled to dangerous proportions in the last days. "Until now we have an escalation of the Libya conflict with some foreign interference. Now we are facing the risk of a true regional escalation. And that risk was averted in Berlin," he noted, adding that world powers have made "a strong commitment to stop" the perilous spiral.
 Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov pointed to some positive takeaways from the Berlin pow-wow, but said the summit failed to launch necessary talks between Sarraj and Haftar. "It is clear that we have not yet succeeded in launching a serious and stable dialogue between them," Lavrov told reporters after the Berlin conference, where Haftar and Sarraj did not meet face to face.
 Nevertheless, the Libyan parties had taken "a small step" forward, Lavrov added. Pro-Haftar forces had upped the ante on the eve of the talks by blocking oil exports at Libya's key ports, crippling the country's main income source in protest at Turkey's decision to send troops to shore up Sarraj's Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA).
 Ahead of the talks, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan lashed out at Haftar, saying he needed to drop his "hostile attitude" if Libya is to have any chance at winning peace. The flaring oil crisis underlined the devastating impact of foreign influence in the conflict, in which Sarraj's GNA is backed by Turkey and Qatar while Haftar has the support of Russia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.
 Russia has been accused of sending in mercenaries to help Haftar as Moscow seeks to extend its influence in the region -- allegations it denies. For Turkey, the fall of Sarraj's GNA could jeopardise a maritime boundary agreement the parties signed.
 It gives Ankara extensive rights over the eastern Mediterranean where the recent discovery of undersea gas reserves has triggered a scramble by littoral states. Erdogan has repeatedly urged Europe to stand united behind Sarraj's government, warning that Tripoli's fall could allow jihadist groups like the Islamic State or Al-Qaeda to regroup.
 He has also cautioned that further unrest could prompt a new wave of migrants to head for Europe. Amid the latest apparent ceasefire violation in which GNA forces on Sunday accused Haftar's militia of opening fire on them in southern Tripoli, Sarraj issued a plea for international "protection troops" if Haftar keeps up his offensive.
 The call echoed a similar suggestion by the EU's chief diplomat Josep Borrell, who stressed that monitors must be present to check that any ceasefire and weapons embargo are respected. With the idea gathering pace, Britain and Italy had voiced readiness to help.
 But as Guterres noted, that discussion remains premature. "First, we need to have a ceasefire -- we cannot monitor something that doesn't exist." (AFP) RUP

University of Toronto bioethicist Dr. Kerry Bowman believes that so far, things are going reasonably well with MAID. There was no lemming-like rush among Canadians for assisted death and fewer than 1% seek help in dying.
 Bowman also says doctors and nurses have proved to be flexible and accommodating within the law.
 Nonetheless, he has reservations about expanding those laws.
 "Critics kept saying -- and they have a point -- that once the legislation went through, it would broaden and broaden until it goes from something that was once quite restricted, to a circus tent of inclusion."
 Bowman has decades of experience working with the dying. He supports MAID in principle, but fears expanding the laws will eventually warp social perspective.
 "The day will come when we'll see a person in a wheelchair, with whatever disability, and rather than think, 'Can I be of any help to them?' we're going to think, 'Why would they do that to other people and to society? Why wouldn't that person move on?'
 "That's not a subtle shift. That's a profound shift in how we view human frailness, illness, vulnerability," Bowman added. "Some think we're nowhere near that kind of a society, but I do think as we expand the definition, we're going to begin to see that, because legal structures greatly influence what people consider to be ethical questions.
 "As soon as something is legal, people assume it must also be ethical -- otherwise, it would never have become law."
 Trudo Lemmens, a professor and Scholl Chair in Health Law and Policy at the University of Toronto, also has serious concerns about expanding MAID over what he calls “a normalization” of the practise.
 "It raises concerns about the impact on people who are not close to the end of life, people who are elderly or disabled, and in the way we think about issues of having a chronic disability or mental illness, or being old and suffering from ailments."
 Lemmens said he hopes Canada will err on the side of caution.
 "It's not just about individual choice. There is also a state-endorsed system of health-care providers being asked to perform these procedures. Originally, it seemed to be to help ease the transition between life and death -- and that's where many people thought, 'Why not? Why not make it easier for people to have that transition?'"

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Florida International's James Morgan led two first- quarter scoring drives and Charlotte's Benny LeMay rushed for two touchdowns to lead the East to a 31-27 victory in the East-West Shrine Bowl on Saturday.
   
 LeMay's 9-yard TD run with just under two minutes remaining sealed offensive MVP honors for the 5-foot-8, 216-pound running back in the nation's longest- running college football all-star game, which was played at Tropicana Field.
   
 Morgan started at quarterback for the East and shared playing time with Princeton's Kevin Davidson and Mississippi State's Tommy Stevens, who led his team downfield for the winning TD after the West took a 27-24 lead on James Robinson's 63-yard scoring run.
   
 Robinson, who rushed for 1,899 yards and 18 touchdowns for Illinois State this season, finished with 80 yards rushing on seven attempts. He gained an additional 56 yards on two pass receptions, one a 46-yarder that led to a field goal.
   
 Utah's Tyler Huntley threw a 7-yard TD pass to San Diego State tight end Parker Houston and North Texas' Mason Fine tossed a 36-yard scoring pass to Ohio State's Binjimon Victor to help the West wipe out an early two-touchdown deficit and make it 17-all heading into the fourth quarter.
   
 Morgan, meanwhile, continued to state his case as a potential pick in the NFL draft by completing 9 of 14 passes for 116 yards, including a 9-yard TD throw to Louisiana's Ja'Marcus Bradley to finish the East's game-opening drive.
   
 Navy wide receiver Macolm Perry took a direct snap from center and sprinted 52 yards for a TD on his only carry. Versatile UCF running back Adrian Killins Jr. had only one rushing attempt but led the East with seven catches for 91 yards, including a 37-yard reception on the game-winning drive.
   
 Stevens also had an 18-yard completion to Rhode Island's Aaron Parker to set up LeMay's second touchdown.

In April of 1920, area business leaders were similar to business leaders of today. They had vision for the community to be a vibrant hub of retail, service, industry, education, healthcare, entertainment, and culture. They were dedicated to making the community a wonderful place to raise their families. They were confident in success and had the courage to move forward with new ventures.
 These business leaders were excited for change and the prospect of something new. These officers joined forces with the Board of Directors and developed the Greater Burlington Association, which was a reorganization of the Commercial Exchange.
 The Greater Burlington Association was later renamed the Burlington Chamber of Commerce in 1930, and in 1983 it merged with the West Burlington Chamber of Commerce to create the Burlington/West Burlington Chamber of Commerce. Today, we recognize the organization as the Greater Burlington Partnership and enjoy a vision celebrated by partners in Economic Development, Convention and Visitors Bureau and Downtown Partners. The current leaders continue to have a vision for success, creating a quality of life that we can all enjoy.
 In 2020, the Greater Burlington Partnership is excited to celebrate the past 100 years with a number of special activities. It's an exhilarating time. The Board of Directors gave you a sneak peak into the fun with an old time photo that was featured on the November newsletter.
 The festivities will kick off with flapper dresses, speakeasies and gangsters as we go back in time to the Roaring Twenties at the Annual Dinner in January. It's sure to be the cat's pajamas. A special video on our history will be featured that night as well. The celebration won't stop there; events will be held during the summer, a look back at the history of the Chamber of Commerce will be featured each month in The Partnership newsletter, and visits to members and a ribbon cutting to commemorate the special day are in the works. As they may have said in the 1920s, "This year will be the bee's knees!" I hope you celebrate with us.
 The 100th Anniversary of the Chamber of Commerce is going to be an exciting year, but I believe every year is exciting. For the past 20 years I have been able to be a part of those exciting times, and it's been a thrilling ride. I love hearing stories from members who had their "best year ever," a Young Professional who met new friends or a Greater Burlington Leadership Alumni who is now chair of a local board. The Chamber of Commerce is a business organization, but it's the people who make the difference, continuing the vision and spirit of the leaders from 1920.
 Kay Sackville Breuer is is the Vice President of the Greater Burlington Partnership.

NEW ORLEANS (AP) " ExhibitBE came to a triumphant close on Martin Luther King Day, five years ago. Some of the original murals that crowded the walls of the derelict five-story DeGaulle Manor apartment building are still intact, though some have been tagged over or altered. The building itself is still a sprawling unoccupied shell, sprouting weeds and strewn with trash, old mattresses and other debris. The hazardous site is no longer open to the public.
 ExhibitBE (sometimes spelled Exhibit Be) remains the most important New Orleans artwork of the 21st-century. Brandon 'bmike' Odums, the 29-year-old mastermind behind the project, billed it as the largest street art exhibit in the American South. But it came to represent much more.
 The random collision of dozens of enormous artworks by area graffiti writers and street artists transformed the forlorn architecture into a collaborative surrealist masterpiece that no museum could contain. More importantly, Odums' portraits of civil rights heroes from Harriet Tubman to Martin Luther King Jr. to Muhammad Ali, made it a Crescent City icon of the Black Lives Matter movement.
 Though the DeGaulle Manor had closed before Hurricane Katrina, the ruined building tapped into the post-flood gestalt perfectly. It symbolized the displacement of much of the population, particularly of lower-income African Americans.
 During the creation of ExhibitBE, Odums said that it was very characteristic of New Orleans to change a blighted environment into something beautiful.
 'Whether it's the food, the music, the jazz funerals, we find ways to make something out of nothing. That's true to street art. That's true to graffiti in general. That's true to hip hop in general, but I feel like New Orleans has always done it with a certain effortlessness.'
 When ExhibitBE was created in 2014, thousands made a pilgrimage to the desolate site to see the wild, monumental artwork and acknowledge all it represented. Erykah Badu sang at the official closing of the show. Odums, a NOCCA grad and former UNO student, instantly became a New Orleans star.
 As he planned the big project, Odums said he'd been advised that it would be impossible to get the 'lone wolves' of the graffiti scene to cooperate. Happily, the paint-spattered renegades must have recognized that the moment had come to prove once and for all that graffiti was the most important contemporary visual art form.
 'I'm happy for what it represented; what can happen when the community and creative people come together,' said Odums in a recent telephone conversation.
 Odums said he's not surprised that some of the original art has been painted over.
 'That's the natural organic lifespan of street art,' he said. 'That's to be expected.'
 One of the most striking images in all of ExhibitBE was Odums' haunting 50-foot painting of a teenage murder victim. In recent years, someone has replaced the realistic eyes in Odums' mega-portrait with cartoonishly doleful eyes that turn what was poignant into something maudlin. Odums said he thinks the face may have been altered for a movie shoot.
 His magnificent suite of portraits in the apartment complex's former rec room remain untouched.
 The fate of the deteriorating apartment complex, which is owned by Granaio LLC, according to the New Orleans Assessor's office website, is unknown. Odums has moved on to other projects, such as his current solo exhibit at the Newcomb Art Museum on the Tulane University campus.
 Looking back on ExhibitBE after five years, he was a bit rueful.
 'If anyone can go back to their younger self, they'd see they had a lot more courage. There was a lot of fearlessness in that moment.'

For his bravery, Miller was presented with the Navy Cross in May 1942. He was the first black sailor to be awarded the medal, one of the Navy's highest honors.
 "This marks the first time in this conflict that such high tribute has been made in the Pacific Fleet to a member of his race and I'm sure that the future will see others similarly honored for brave acts," Adm. Chester Nimitz, the commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, said at the time.
 Miller had won renown, and he was brought home in November 1942 for a two- month tour to promote war bonds. His image was used on a Navy recruiting poster.
 He did not survive the war. Miller was aboard the USS Liscome Bay __ when it was struck by a Japanese torpedo in the Pacific in 1943. Nearly 650 of the more than 900 sailors on board died when the ship sank, and Miller's body was never recovered.
 He was posthumously awarded a Purple Heart, among other honors.
 Shortly after Miller's death, the Navy began a small officer-training program for black sailors. In March 1944, the Navy commissioned its first black officers, known as the Golden Thirteen.
