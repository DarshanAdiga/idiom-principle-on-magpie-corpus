The vehicle was tracked to nearby Porthdafarch Beach car park on the night and data showed timings of when the engine was turned on and off, along with when doors and the boot were opened or closed.


  CCTV backed up the data showing the movements of the car.


  Sky also confirmed a satellite signal "was no longer present" at 00:28.


  The court had previously heard the defendant told police he was having an affair with friend Barrie Williams and they had engaged in sexual activities in a nearby field at the time.


  It is claimed he told officers he had opened the car boot - as picked up on the data - to remove a bag containing latex gloves, handcuffs and baby oil.


  But the jury was told Mr Williams was likely to tell them he had not seen the defendant that night.


  Mr Whall also denies a charge of perverting the course of justice, along with three others, amid allegations they conspired together to set fire to a vehicle later found burnt out.


  The other three - Martin Roberts, 34, of James Street in Bangor, Darren Jones, 41, of the Bryn Ogwen estate at Penrhosgarnedd and Gavin Jones, 36, of High Street, Bangor - also deny the charges.

If housewife Breda Nash is feeling stoned, it's no wonder. For husband Keith has just won the car of her dreams.
 It's 20-years-old and has seen better days.
 But it belonged to her idol - Rolling Stone Mick Jagger.
 His blue Ford Galaxy was the prize in a national newspaper competition which asked contestants to complete a list of Stones record titles.
 And butcher Keith, 30 - a competition fanatic - got plenty of satisfaction when he heard the news.
 "It's terrific," he said after driving the American monster back up from London.
 But Breda - a fan and Stones record collectors since the 60s - was also driven wild by the old vehicle registration document which came with the prize.
 It says the owner was Michael Philip Jagger of Munro Terrace, London... and it's specially signed by the man himself.
 "I'm absolutely thrilled," said mother-of-two Breda, 30, of Hornchurch Drive, Chorley. "We've never stopped giving friends and relatives a drive round in it."
 One snag is that they have had to find a secret place to keep it - and another is that they spent £42 in petrol getting it back from London.
 But the 6.3 litre, 17½-foot-long, fully automatic convertible limousine is still one in a million for Breda.

As tensions heat up in Libya with barely a glimmer of hope for a ceasefire, let alone a lasting peace built on a national consensus, some have noted with a certain degree of shock that one of the primary antagonists in the Libyan civil war is not even Libyan, but is, in fact, the full economic might of the United Arab Emirates bearing down on its fellow Arab League member.&nbsp;The diminutive Arab oil monarchy has been wreaking havoc for years in Libya, a country almost 3,000 kilometres away, and in a manner that has been so destructive as to cause the head of the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli, Fayez al Sarraj, to condemn the UAE&rsquo;s meddling in his country&rsquo;s affairs.But what reason does the UAE have to meddle in a civil war thousands of kilometres away? And why does Abu Dhabi believe that it has skin in the game?&nbsp;The short answer to that is that no one fears a democratic and free Libya more than the Emiratis.The Arab Spring effectIf one looks at the world map, it is easy to see why Sarraj would say that the UAE has &ldquo;no right&rdquo; to intervene in his country&rsquo;s affairs. After all, Libya and the UAE share no common borders and the Emirates already have their own significant oil stocks and a thriving economy, making them one of the wealthiest countries in the world and with no particular need for Libya&rsquo;s vast oil wealth.However, this goes far beyond the usual narratives of colonial exploitation, expansionism, and imperialism that can be applied to major global powers like the United States, Russia, or China.&nbsp;For the UAE, this is an ideological conflict, one which pits the Middle Eastern ancien r&eacute;gime of military dictatorships and oil monarchies against the swelling desire of Arab polities to live a dignified life under civilian governments they choose.&nbsp;In other words, such thinking is anathema to the ruling monarchs of the Arabian Gulf, and no other country has taken to the counterrevolutionary fight with as much gusto as the UAE.The most recent, often violent, expression of this popular desire for freedom came about in the Arab Spring that shook the region in 2011 and was the first real threat to the old guard&rsquo;s grip on power. Their reaction was to respond with overwhelming brutality and state-sponsored terror, crushing the people&rsquo;s will in Egypt by way of a UAE and Saudi-backed coup, creating a proxy war in Yemen between Arab powers and Iran, instigating the mass slaughter and displacement of the people of Syria, and triggering the internecine strife that has racked Libya since the overthrow of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi.&nbsp;Indeed, the only country able to avert total disaster against its democratic process has been Tunisia which recently conducted free and fair elections.Despite the Arab Spring&rsquo;s &ldquo;failure&rdquo; to bring about freedom across most of the lands that felt its effects, the fact that it happened at all served as an early warning system to the region&rsquo;s monarchs and dictators.&nbsp;The Gulf oil monarchs, for example, went to expensive lengths to buy the continued loyalty of their populations, with the UAE agreeing to pay off more than a million dollars of debt to any citizen. This demonstrates just how fearful they were of their people asking for more of a say in the country&rsquo;s affairs.Crushing freedom at home and abroadThe UAE&rsquo;s threat perception of the political landscape both domestically and regionally changed entirely with the advent of the Arab Spring, an event which acted as the catalyst for a more muscular foreign and national security policy approach.Domestically, Abu Dhabi has overseen a crackdown on political and human rights activists, most notably with the arrest and subsequent sentencing to ten years in prison of human rights defender Ahmed Mansoor.&nbsp;Mansoor was arrested in 2017 and held incommunicado for a year in degrading conditions without access to a lawyer. When he was finally put on trial in 2018, he was accused of fomenting sedition against the state through his human rights advocacy.&nbsp;Crucially, testimonies of former American intelligence operatives show that a complicated cyber spying programme was used to illegally acquire the evidence against Mansoor, who is now being left to rot in an Emirati prison.Regionally, and returning to Libya, the UAE has decided to pursue the strategy of backing any anti-democratic force capable of seizing power and smothering people&rsquo;s hopes for freedom in the cradle.&nbsp;They, alongside Egypt and Saudi Arabia, have thrown their weight behind warlord and former CIA intelligence asset Khalifa Haftar to the tune of billions of dollars to finance his mercenary Libyan National Army (LNA) which is staffed by significant numbers of foreign fighters.Like other countries in Africa, the UAE has also financed the construction of its&nbsp;military bases inside Libya itself even though it barely has any of its own armed forces to speak of. They instead use bases like this and in neighbouring Niger so allied countries who do not have the independent ability to project power, such as Egypt, can utilise them for air strikes against targets to assist Haftar&rsquo;s advance who is now struggling to breach the defences of Tripoli.Should Haftar seize Tripoli and topple the GNA, it will prove to be a coup of regional proportions with the UAE being one of the main antagonists having puppeteered events from afar. It will send a message that Arab populations can expect to be under the boot for generations to come and they would be better off staying put or else risk losing all semblance of peace and stability in their lives.If the UAE has its way, it will be generations before another attempt at freedom is made, and the next time might be even more violent than now as populations realise that protests and engaging in gradual reforms will not be respected and will instead be met with death and torture at the hands of warlords backed by the vast wealth of the UAE and its allies.

“He did not call an ambulance when he realised Kayleigh had stopped moving. Instead, the prosecution say, he set about laying the groundwork for this false defence, cutting himself with the knife and placing the knife near Kayleigh’s body.
 “Even when he eventually called the emergency services it was not an ambulance he asked for, but the police.
 “He murdered Kayleigh Hanks by strangling her in the presence of their seven month old baby daughter.”
 Ms Healy told the court that Miss Hanks and Mr Paton had a ‘volatile and on- off relationship for about three years’, in which they argued regularly.
 Miss Hanks had confided in her supervisor at the Lennox Lodge care home where she worked, Natasha Stevens, about two incidents in 2018 while she was pregnant.
 She told her colleague that she and Mr Paton had been in a parked car arguing when Mr Paton grabbed hold of the back of her neck and slammed her face into the dashboard of the car, the court heard.
 On another occasion, Miss Hanks told her colleague, Mr Paton had pinned her against the wall by her throat during an argument.
 Ms Healy said on one occasion, while in the presence of her sister, Mr Paton demanded Miss Hanks got on her knees and declared her love for him.
 Speaking behind a screen, Emma Hanks said Mr Paton’s relationship with her sister was ‘ok at the beginning and then toxic’.
 Ms Healy said Miss Hanks was ‘over the moon’ when she discovered she was pregnant as an earlier ectopic pregnancy meant she could not have children.
 She told the court the couple had broken up a few weeks into the pregnancy but shortly after their daughter was born in December 2018, Miss Hanks and Mr Paton got back together.
 The trial, at Hove Crown Court, continues.

The success of that strategy, since copied by United’s peer clubs among the football elite, keeps United high in the revenue leagues and has made Woodward a rich man. He earns a reported £3.15m a year, and possesses 539,000 Class A shares in Manchester United plc, valued at $10.8m, on which he receives healthy dividends. In the Old Trafford stands, however, he is decried as a leading architect of the club’s fall from grace. It is not that United have not spent money – around £840m has been lavished on transfers since Ferguson retired and the club pays out the second-highest wage bill in football – but that it has been wasted on folly and failure.

Ma quella sulla web tax e' solo l'ultimo tassello di un puzzle di minacce e dichiarazioni forti che da tempo si rincorrono sulle politiche commerciali tra Ue e Usa. Il leader americano oggi e' tornato a tuonare contro l'Europa minacciando di imporre tariffe del 25% sulle auto del Vecchio Continente, se Washington e Bruxelles non raggiungeranno un accordo complessivo sul commercio. "Fare un accordo con l'Unione europea - ha detto - e' piu' difficile che farlo con chiunque altro. Hanno approfittato del nostro Paese per molti anni. Tuttavia, alla fine sara' molto facile perche' se non riusciamo a trovare un accordo, dovremo applicare tariffe del 25% sulle loro auto". Non solo, Trump ha annunciato un prossimo incontro al Wto dove gli Usa faranno "passi significativi" e ha comunque auspicato di trovare un'intesa con Bruxelles "entro le elezioni". La presidente della Commissione Ue pero' non e' sembrata scomporsi troppo. "Ci sara' un accorso sul commercio tra Ue e Usa entro qualche settimana" ha annunciato fiduciosa. L'accordo sulla web tax potrebbe quindi rivelarsi decisivo per disinnescare una miccia che potrebbe esplodere in una guerra commerciale senza precedenti. "E' discriminatoria per sua natura e complicata" ha detto senza mezzi termini Mnuchin. "Ma se si vuole imporre una tassa sulle nostre societa', allora prenderemo in considerazione le tasse sulle case automobilistiche". "Noi - ha aggiunto - abbattiamo le barriere sul commercio e vorremmo le stesse opportunita' nel mondo. Vogliamo che siano anche gli altri a buttare giu' i muri di Berlino".

Perfect For Gaming?
 Not quite, although Ryzen has come a long way in the last few generations, this second gen was still trying to patch up some of the latency issues the Original AMD Ryzen 1800X had. That's not to say it's not good, at most you're looking at 0-8% fewer frames than its Intel counterpart at 1080p, but it's just something to be aware of. Once you reach over those heady FullHD resolutions however, both 1440p and 4K gaming level out, and that's where the AMD Ryzen 7 2700X really shines as a processor. In fact it was so good it held the top spot in our best CPUs list for an impressively long time because of it.
 Although it may be two years old at this point where the Ryzen 7 2700X really shines is in those computational tasks. Want to render at 4K? Doddle, 3D-modelling a new skeleton for your indie game? Sorted, want to start your own Twitch stream from one PC? No sweat.
 When it first launched AMD's Ryzen series of processors was groundbreaking for just how much value it packed into each and every core. When it came to bang for the buck, it was hard to beat. Now, with the price drop down to £158, it's, well, just incredible value for money. Go back just four years now, and £158 would barely get you an Intel Core i5 with four cores.

East Bengal on Thursday appointed Mario Rivera as new head coach of the team, a position which was lying vacant after the sudden resignation of Alejandro Menendez.


  Rivera, who was a former deputy to Menendez, has been appointed as head coach till the end of the season, the club said in a statement.


  An Uefa Pro Licence coach, Rivera had most of his coaching stints in Spain. Rivera is familiar with the team and coaching staff and this will be an advantage for the remainder of the season.


  Rivera is expected to join the club in the second week of February, probably in time to oversee the fixture against Aizawl FC as he is yet to get his visa. The red and gold brigade next take on Chennai City and Indian Arrows with Bastab Roy in charge of the team.


  Menendez faced a lot of criticism after East Bengal suffered a hat-trick of defeats, the last one coming against arch-rivals Mohun Bagan 1-2 in the I-League derby.


  East Bengal has slipped to seventh in the I-League standings with eight points from seven matches. Their arch-rivals Mohun Bagan, on the other hand, lead the standings with 17 points from eight matches.

Noting as early as 1875 the growing popularity of diamond engagement rings, the weekly also called on the “mothers and daughters in Israel to discourage” the practice and to deposit the money that would otherwise go toward the purchase of a ring “in a good savings bank.” Its words fell on deaf ears.

The early rounds were about two things: Stolen bases and starting pitchers. The former everyone is well aware now are in short supply, and there's pressure to secure them early, with a multi-talented player, so that you don't fall behind in the power categories pursuing a specialist later.
 Starting pitcher, though ... I thought I was on an island there. Historically, it hasn't been a big draw in the early rounds, particularly in this format, because of its higher risk for injury and year-to-year variability. But the drop-off at the position is so extreme in the middle rounds that you kind of just have to bite the bullet, especially knowing how deep the hitter pool is.
 I took a starting pitcher with my first pick and my third pick, which I'm pretty sure I've never done in my history of playing Rotisserie. But then I got caught up gawking at the hitter values round after round, presuming I couldn't afford to pass up _that_ opportunity only to see a similar one the next time around, and by the time I dipped back into the pitcher pool for my third starter, Hyun-Jin Ryu was the best remaining.
 It's not a bad staff, but it's not good enough considering I basically punted on stolen bases waiting for "fair value," which meant being a round late on Victor Robles, Tommy Edman and Garrett Hampson. You're just going to have to reach for stolen bases at some point. It sucks, but if you want to keep playing traditional Rotisserie, it's where the game is right now.
 So clearly, I'll need to regroup, maybe re-think some of my rankings at the top now that I have a better sense of what others are doing, because I just wasn't satisfied with the way this team turned out. It's too strong in some areas and not strong enough in others, which is precisely how _not_ to build a Rotisserie team.

I-League leaders Mohun Bagan registered an emphatic 3-0 victory away from home against Neroca FC at the Khuman Lampak Stadium in Imphal on Thursday.


  Nongdamba Naorem gave Mohun Bagan the lead in the 27th minute before creating the second goal for Papa Diawara in the 53rd minute. Substitute Komron Tursunov added the third, deep into stoppage time, to seal the deal for the Mariners.


  Neroca head coach Gift Raikhan made just a solitary change to his previous match line-up, with Ronald Singh coming in for Zico Sekle, while his Mohun Bagan counterpart Kibu Vicuna named an unchanged eleven.


  Neroca had their first attempt against the run of play in the 16th minute, when a Marvin Phillip goal-kick found Boubacar Diarra, who, after seeing Mohun Bagan keeper Sankar Roy off his line, went for glory from the half-way line. His effort did not get the desired result as the ball gently nestled the top of the net, leaving Sankar a relieved man.


  In the 24th minute, Fran Gonzales sent VP Suhair with a textbook through ball down the right. With only the keeper to beat, Suhair’s attempt ricocheted off the woodwork and fell to Diawara, who had a second crack on goal with an acrobatic scissor kick, but his audacious attempt sailed over the bar.


  With Mohun Bagan clearly running one-way traffic at this point, Neroca had started putting more men in their box, making it more challenging for Vicuna’s men to penetrate the final third.


  Nongdamba Naorem, with two orange shirts closing him down, released the ball to Joseba Beitia. With the ball at his feet, the Spaniard now had all the attention, which gave Naorem the time he needed to make the run inside the box. Beitia flicked it towards Dhanachadra Singh who had read Naorem’s run, and squared it back to him.


  With three defenders closing him down, and Marvin Phillip making himself big and committing to the cause, Naorem outsmarted everyone and gently toe-poked it past the near post instead, finishing off the move he had started to give his side a well-deserved lead in the 27th minute.


  In the 42nd minute, Moiranghthem Meitei handled the ball just outside the edge of his box and conceded a free-kick in the process. It was Diawara who stepped up and his thunderbolt of an attempt flashed across goal but Marvin Phillip got a strong right hand and parried it away from danger.


  The league leaders went in at half-time, being firmly in the driving seat.


  In the 53rd minute, it was Naorem again but this time, he left Dhananjoy Singh scrambling across, with his deft feints and with one smart switch of the ball to his stronger right, he delivered a calculated cross that seemed to float forever before it found Diawara, completely unmarked, for Mohun Bagan’s second goal of the day.


  Neroca failed to weave any real threat whatsoever, as Mohun Bagan closed in on another victory. Despite being up by two goals, they were hungry for more and added another in the fourth minute of stoppage time.


  Late substitutes PM Britto and Komron Tursunov combined well, with the former playing a delightful through ball which left few tired Neroca legs at bay, while the latter made a great run to hunt it down and made no mistake in squaring it past Marvin Phillip to score his first goal for the club and putting the cherry on the top of an emphatic Mohun Bagan victory.


  Mohun Bagan remain ahead of the chasing pack, taking their tally to 20 points while Neroca drop to ninth in the standings.
