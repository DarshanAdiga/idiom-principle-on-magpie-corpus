At the tribe switch he swapped over to Rotu, where he lost footing and power with his new group of players. When the tribes eventually merged into one, he was the first person to get the boot.

In 2017, our Archive-It service was awarded funding from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) for the 2-year project “Community Webs: Empowering Public Librarians to Create Community History Web Archives.” The program has been providing training and technical infrastructure for a diverse group of librarians nationwide to develop expertise in creating collections of historically valuable web-published materials documenting their local communities and under-represented communities. In response to an unexpectedly large group of applicants, and with additional internal funding, we were able to expand the cohort to a total of 28 libraries from 16 states. The launch announcement and the dedicated website have further information about the program and its progress.

WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump pitched his proposed payroll tax break Tuesday on Capitol Hill as pressure mounts on the administration and Congress to work more vigorously to contain the coronavirus outbreak and respond to the financial fallout.


   


  Trump's economic team joined in presenting the economic stimulus package privately to wary Senate Republicans, who have been cool to additional spending at this stage. Democrats are preparing their own package of low-cost virus testing, unemployment insurance and sick pay for workers struggling to keep paychecks coming as the outbreak disrupts workplaces.


   


  "We're taking this unbelievably seriously," Trump said after his meeting at the Capitol. "It will go away, just stay calm."


   


  Asked why he has not yet been tested for the virus, after having been in close contact with several advisers and members of Congress who are now self- quarantined after exposure, Trump said: "I don't think it's a big deal" and "I feel very good."


   


  White House officials have been blindsided by the president's sudden moves. As Trump headed to Capitol Hill, two administration officials said the proposals he was putting in play had not been completed. They were unauthorized to discuss the planning and requested anonymity.


   


  In addition to payroll tax relief, Trump has said he wants help for hourly- wage workers to ensure they're "not going to miss a paycheck" and "don't get penalized for something that's not their fault." He's also mentioned small- business loans.


   


  But so far, the president's approach, based on tax breaks, is receiving a cool response from Democrats as well as Republicans from his own party who say it's too soon to consider fresh spending from Capitol Hill. Trump also said Tuesday he planned to help the beleaguered cruise-ship and airline industries.


   


  Earlier, Speaker Nancy Pelosi told House Democrats that Congress should keep working this week despite concerns about infection spreading there.


   


  "We are the captains of the ship," Pelosi said during a closed-door meeting, according to a person in the room unauthorized to discuss the private caucus and granted anonymity. "We are the last to leave." But time is short as Congress heads toward its scheduled break next week.


   


  For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.


   


  The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 58,000 have so far recovered.


   


  At the U.S. Capitol, lawmakers were given new instructions on how to protect themselves, with the House's attending physician asking them to stop shaking hands or touching people during greetings. He recommended the split-fingers Star Trek greeting instead.


   


  Crowds are the norm in the Capitol and handshakes are coin of the realm there, even between political foes. But about a half dozen lawmakers have placed themselves in quarantine after being exposed to someone who had the virus, and the norm has been upended.


   


  During House Democrats' closed session, one lawmaker, Rep. Raul Ruiz, D-Ca., who is a doctor, noted that the average age in Congress is 57, some lawmakers have underlying health conditions and their work requires them to fly back and forth between home and the capital.


   


  Still, Pelosi implored lawmakers to keep working to strengthen the country's defenses. Rather than picking up their own coffee and snacks for the breakfast meeting, lawmakers were served by staff from the buffet and warned off touching the serving utensils.


   


  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell opened the chamber saying only that Republicans "look forward to discussing" the ideas "so we can all consider the best ways to move forward." Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and adviser Larry Kudlow are expected at the weekly GOP lunch.


   


  The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, said the virus outbreak demands a "health care" solution. Democrats are proposing affordable testing, more unemployment benefits and paid leave for working families affected by the virus.


   


  "The administration seems to believe that the answer to any problem is another tax cut," Schumer said. "The best way to ensure economic security for the American people is to deal directly with the coronavirus itself.


   


  It was not immediately clear how Trump was aiming to provide assistance to employees weighing whether to stay home because of illness -- a crucial aim of public health officials seeking to curtail the spread of the virus.


   


  One mechanism, backed by the Trump-allied National Association of Manufacturers, involves a proposed tax credit for employers who pay employees who are quarantined.


   


  Trump stepped forward with the contours of an initiative Monday after markets dropped sharply and as the outbreak spread. markets recovered from some of the losses Tuesday, reacting positively to the prospects for an economic boost from Washington.


   


  Several Trump confidants have disclosed they are isolating themselves after potential exposure to the virus; one lawmaker traveled with the president from Florida on Air Force One on Monday; another was his just-tapped new chief of staff.


   


  The Securities and Exchange Commission, which monitors financial markets, encouraged employees at its Washington headquarters to work from home after an employee there had respiratory symptoms and was referred for coronavirus testing.


   


  And Defense Secretary Mark Esper postponed a trip to India, Pakistan and Uzbekistan that was to begin Monday, citing the coronavirus crisis, Pentagon press secretary Alyssa Farah said Tuesday. She said he would remain in the U.S to help manage the Pentagon response.


   


  At the Capitol, Democratic lawmakers were told by the House chief administrative officer behind closed doors that the office could support up to 10,000 staff members teleworking if need be. Laptop orders were being expedited and cyber-security measures reviewed.

Our management team stands ready to review and revise the plan in light of any new information. As for our APUS students, there is no better example of the informed choice that they have made to advance their purpose through online coursework and for those students who need a low cost alternative to their current on-ground coursework, we certainly have the capacity to support higher enrollments should we see an increase in demand for online learning due to the coronavirus impact. We believe that APUS is an excellent stay-at-home option for those wanting to advance their skills, stay on track with their pathway, and experience affordable, flexible courses for transfer from APU and AMU, all while taking precautions to prevent transmission of an infectious virus.

But a major change could be in the works to fix that.Tuesday, Emma Locke liked what she heard at City Hall. The city voted to buy the properties.“I like to see our city grow, and maybe our kids will stay home. We got something for them to look forward to,” said the retired school teacher. “I think it’s great.”Mayor Earl Johnson made no apologies for spending $1.7 million of taxpayer money to make it happen.The City of Andalusia is spending $1.7 million to buy 18 properties as part of a major downtown renovation plan.“And we had reached a point in our downtown that we were blocked, we couldn’t go any further," he explained. “So, this was either take that step or just sit here and let those beautiful old buildings - some of these buildings are some of the most historic buildings in Andalusia,” he said.The grand plan is to market the properties with the vision of loft apartments and retail.“Bring in a mix of retail, business professional office buildings and that kind of stuff,” said the mayor.And there’s more; city leaders say they plan to turn one piece of vacant property into a 6-acre park."You know, envisioning this as a public park with a public place to gather beautiful water features and bikeable paths,” explained Andalusia Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Chrissie Duffy.Developers are already reaching out. Some work could begin as early as three months to get a major part of downtown back on track to vibrancy.

There’s no oversight mechanism in place for American oversight of Canadian pharmacies. The FDA openly admits that it “cannot ensure the safety and effectiveness of drugs that it has not approved.” Implementing either of the proposed rules could open the floodgates to counterfeit shipments, expired, mislabeled and unapproved products.                    Ill-considered importation schemes put American patients in harm’s way. Consider a 2018 raid conducted by Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The Mounties seized pharmaceutical shipments about the cross the border. Of the 3,586 packages searched, 87 percent contained counterfeit or illegal products. And just last year, the FDA issued a warning to Canadian drug firm CanaRx for distributing “unapproved” and “misbranded” drugs to Americans.                    Canada opposes U.S. importation of Canadian drugs. Canada’s foreign ministry warned that the exchange would exacerbate drug shortages in Canada. Already, there are more than 2,000 actual or anticipated shortages in Canada, impacting one in four Canadians between 2015 and 2018.                    Drug importation will endanger both American and Canadian lives for little or no savings. It’s time to heed the experts, our Canadian friends and the FDA’s consistent warnings and abandoned these soundbite proposals.                     _Peter J.

A bill to allow college athletes to profit off of their name, image and likeness passed the Florida Senate Monday morning and is on its way to the House for final approval.


   


  "This is long overdue," said Sen. Rob Bradley, R-Fleming Island, noting that Florida's bill follows in the steps of the California Assembly.


   


  "Florida has now stepped up and made a bold statement as well," he added. "I think we send a clear message to the NCAA, the Big 10 and other conferences that we're serious when it comes to doing the right thing for our student athletes."


   


  With little discussion, the Senate approved the bill (SB 646) by Sen. Debbie Mayfield, R-Melbourne, by a vote of 37-2.


   


  University merger idea falls apart in Florida Legislature


   


  Sens. Keith Perry, R-Gainesville, and Joe Gruters, R-Sarasota, voted against the measure. Perry's district includes the University of Florida.


   


  The bill is expected to be taken up by the House this week.


   


  "Today's action in the Florida Senate gets us one step closer to ensuring our more than 11,000 Florida collegiate athletes have the ability to earn compensation on their name, image, and likeness," said House bill sponsor Chip LaMarca, R-Lighthouse Point, in a news release.


   


  Budget deal steers $100 million to Florida Forever


   


  The bill has had the support of Gov. Ron DeSantis, who attended Yale University on a baseball scholarship.


   


  "While so many others profit off of young women and men, these talented athletes have been left behind by a system that is centered on greed," LaMarca added. "Today we are on the way to changing that.


   


  "I look forward to getting this bill across the goal line for final passage in the House this week."


      


  If Florida approves the measure, it would put a great deal of pressure on the NCAA, said Ramogi Huma, executive director of the National College Players Association.


   


  "Florida is a major college sports state," he said. "This also signals that this is truly a bipartisan effort, not only blue California but Red Florida, too. Florida is a force ... that has the ability to leverage its influence."


   


  The great thing about Florida's bill is its simplicity, Huma said. It doesn't give the NCAA a legal foothold because it doesn't mention the association, like the California law does. "It just says colleges can't prevent these activities," he said.


   


  House Democratic Leader Kionne McGhee had also introduced legislation modeled after the California law, but LaMarca's measure became the vehicle on the House side. His bill was tabled Friday, with the expectation that the House would take up the Senate version this week.


   


  Discussion on the Senate was limited to a few comments.


   


  Sen. Randolph Bracy, D-Orlando, cautioned that the bill "only benefits the very best players at the larger schools" and didn't acknowledge the efforts of players on smaller teams that don't get the same amount of attention as football, basketball and baseball. He hoped to see a "more equitable distribution when we talk about players pay," but said he would support the bill.


   


  Bracy was among the first to file a measure addressing student athlete pay but Mayfield's bill became the Senate's main measure for this session.


   


  Sen. Darryl Rouson, D-St. Petersburg, who filed an amendment over the weekend to conduct a study of the bill's impact on historically black colleges, withdrew his amendment and supported the bill as is.


   


  The bills were filed back in October, after the NCAA Board of Governors announced it would draft rules to allow student athletes to profit off their own name, image and likeness in response to California's passage of a law that would take effect July 2023.


   


  Florida's would take effect July 1, 2021, if approved. Mayfield said she moved the date from 2020 to give the NCAA time to draft rules of its own that would be applied across all 50 states.


   


  Mayfield is also working with U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio's staff on a congressional draft of a bill that would be applied nationwide. "I am certain they will have those rules in place prior to" that, Mayfield told fellow senators last week.


   


  Mayfield's bill is "as simple as it gets," allowing students to hire agents or lawyers to execute contracts to allow them to make money off their own name and image.


   


  "The only prohibition is that universities cannot use it for recruitment," she said.

Another option for the chancellor is to either delay or temporarily scrap business rates, a tax on firms linked to the value of their premises.


  "Cashflow issues are important and business rate suspensions mean businesses could focus on paying employees," said Melissa Geiger of KPMG.


  "It's easier for governments to help businesses by offering tax relief, rather than paying out lump sums," she says.


  Trade body UK Hospitality has written to the government asking for a three- month business rate suspension for the industry, which has been particularly badly hit by the outbreak.


  Hotel occupancy is down 15%, while eating and drinking out has fallen by 7% it says. Advance bookings have slumped by up to 50%.


  Using an existing mechanism - like business rates - to support business would be quick and effective, argues Ms Geiger. In an "emergency Budget" like this, "you have to focus on the short-term" she says.


  "It's about paying more through a system you already have, rather than implementing new tax law quickly, which is very difficult."

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California Gov. Gavin Newsom urged the state's nearly 40 million residents Tuesday to avoid sporting events, concerts and large gatherings to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and adamantly warned the elderly to stay away from cruise ships as he pondered measures to restrict cruise travel off the California coast. The warning came as Newsom announced an update to the painstaking process of disembarking more than 2,000 passengers from a cruise ship struck by the coronavirus and moving them to military bases around the U.S. for a two-week quarantine. The Grand Princess docked in the Port of Oakland Monday after being forced to idle for days off the coast while authorities scrambled to find a suitable port and plan to move the passengers into safe quarantine sites. While at sea, tests on people who showed symptoms of illness confirmed 21 contracted the coronavirus. “I don’t think people should be on cruise ships that are elderly,” Newsom said. “I don’t think you should high-five one another and hug strangers at large sporting events if you have an underlying health condition.” He said legal advisers are reviewing the possibility of restricting cruise travel off the California coast as he awaits new federal guidelines on the cruise industry. In the meantime, he said cruise ships ought to introduce aggressive requirements for travelers “at the peril of that industry collapsing.\" Two people have died and 157 Californians have tested positive so far for the coronavirus, a tally that does not include the cruise ship evacuees. Newsom expects the number of cases to significantly rise as more test kits become available. Many communities have already canceled parades, conferences and large gatherings. Officials in some California cities have gone further. Santa Clara County on...

Over 10 million people have signed up for Disney Plus since it launched last year. It’s easy to understand why. The service gives subscribers access to hundreds of movies and television shows for just $7 a month — no cable plan required.                    Imagine if we applied that model to health care. For a flat monthly fee, subscribers could get everything from flu shots to lab tests “on demand” — no expensive, cumbersome insurance plan required.                    This model already exists. It’s called direct primary care — and Americans young and old, rich and poor alike are increasingly turning to it as a means of securing affordable, high-quality health care.                    Under direct primary care, a patient pays a doctor a subscription-style fee in exchange for access to an array of services. Just a decade ago, there were only a handful of direct primary care practices scattered across the country. Today, over 1,000 serve around half a million people in 49 states.                    The model has flourished in part because many doctors no longer want to deal with insurance. Nearly 75 percent of physicians spend at least 10 hours each week on paperwork. Bureaucratic tasks are the largest contributor to physician burnout, which affects roughly half of all family medicine doctors.                    Burnout is serious. Physicians who experience it are more likely to make medical errors.                    Direct primary care can ease doctors’ workload, reduce risk of burning out, and give them more time to spend with patients. Direct primary care visits often last up to an hour — four times longer than the usual 15-minute visit offered in traditional practices.

Joe Biden took an early lead over rival Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential contest in Michigan on Tuesday and was projected to capture Missouri and Mississippi as six states made their choices in the race to challenge U.S. President Donald Trump. The race in Michigan was too close to call as the last polls closed in the state, television networks and Edison Research said, but Biden led Sanders by 53 to 42 with 26 of precincts reporting in the state, the days biggest prize.Biden, the former vice president under Barack Obama, had been a heavy favorite over Sanders in Mississippi and Missouri and was projected to win easily based on exit polls and early results. Polls also closed in North Dakota with no early results. The polls close later in Washington and Idaho.Biden, 77, was looking to take a big step toward the nomination to face the Republican Trump in the Nov. 3 election after becoming the front-runner with a series of sweeping wins over Sanders in last weeks Super Tuesday contests. Sanders, a democratic socialist and U.S. senator from Vermont, hoped an upset win in Michigan would keep his dwindling White House hopes alive. Sanders, 78, won a stunning upset over Hillary Clinton in Michigan in 2016 that ensured a long nominating fight - something Biden hopes to avoid this time.A total of 352 of the nearly 4,000 delegates to Julys Democratic convention were up for grabs in the six states voting on Tuesday, with Michigan the biggest with 125 delegates. A Biden breakthrough in Michigan, along with his big victories in Missouri and Mississippi, could prove too much for Sanders to overcome. By the end of March, about two-thirds of the delegates will be allocated.Biden was powered to the early victories on Tuesday by strong support from a broad coalition of groups, including women, African Americans, those aged 45 and older, and all but the very liberal, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research. As in earlier states, Bidens support was especially strong among black voters. In Mississippi, where two-thirds of the electorate was African-American, Biden won more than eight of every 10 black voters.Washington and Idaho also held contests on Tuesday. There was no immediate projection for North Dakota, and polls close later in the three other states. As fears spread about the coronavirus, voters in Michigan said they trusted Biden more than Sanders to handle a major crisis, according to exit polls.The polling in Michigan showed about half of voters more trusted Biden in a crisis, compared to one-third who more trusted Sanders, Bidens last viable rival in the race. In Washington, the state hit hardest by coronavirus and the second-largest state to vote on Tuesday, eight in 10 voters voiced concern about the outbreaks effects, with a plurality supporting Biden, according to the Edison Research exit polls.Both candidates called off planned rallies in Cleveland, Ohio, on Tuesday due to concerns over the coronavirus outbreak, which has rattled markets and prompted Democrats to criticize the Trump administrations response. The campaigns said they were following guidance from Ohio public health officials. Until now, Democratic candidates as well as Trump, 73, have largely continued to hold large-scale events despite the outbreak.Since last weeks Super Tuesday romps, Biden has roared into the national lead in polling and delegates, knocked out all remaining viable rivals except Sanders and swept up a wave of endorsements from former contenders such as Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker. Biden, who has touted the Obama administrations decision to bail out the auto industry, made a morning campaign stop at Detroits first new auto assembly plant in decades, owned by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.Unions built the country, Biden shouted through a bullhorn. Youre the best damn workers in the world. But his visit was marred by a clash with one worker who suggested he planned to confiscate Americans guns. Biden, whose propensity to veer off script occasionally causes self-inflicted wounds, snapped at the worker using an obscenity.Sanders has attacked Biden for supporting international trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement, which is unpopular among many of Michigans workers who say it has cost the state jobs. As Biden left the plant, video showed some workers chanting, Trump

It is clear that companies across the board have a significantly greater understanding of blockchain technology than was the case 12 months ago. This stems in part from a surge in R&D (research & development) both internally and in partnership with third parties, with a recognition that blockchain has the potential to be deployed in a variety of use cases. As the number of research projects has increased so, too, has awareness, both amongst the participants and elsewhere in their industries, with competitor companies in turn beginning to consider whether they, too, should seek to gain competitive advantage from deployment.

Joe Biden was projected to cruise to easy wins in Democratic presidential contests in Missouri and Mississippi on Tuesday, striking an early blow against rival Bernie Sanders on a day when six states made their choices in the race to challenge U.S. President Donald Trump. Biden, the former vice president under Barack Obama and a heavy favorite over Sanders in both states, was projected to win the two states by Edison Research and television networks based on exit polls and early results.Polls closed in the two states, along with North Dakota. Biden was powered to the victories by strong support from a broad coalition of groups, including women, African Americans, those aged 45 and older, and all but the very liberal, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research.As in earlier states, Bidens support was especially strong among black voters. In Mississippi, where two-thirds of the electorate was African-American, Biden won more than eight of every 10 black voters. Biden, 77, was looking to take a big step toward the nomination to face the Republican Trump in the Nov. 3 election after becoming the front-runner with a series of sweeping wins over Sanders in last weeks Super Tuesday contests.Sanders, a democratic socialist and U.S. senator from Vermont, hoped an upset win in Michigan on Tuesday would keep his dwindling White House hopes alive. Sanders, 78, won a stunning 2016 upset over Hillary Clinton in Michigan that ensured a long nominating fight - something Biden hopes to avoid this time. Washington and Idaho also held contests on Tuesday. There was no immediate projection for North Dakota, and polls close later in the three other states.As fears spread about the coronavirus, voters in Michigan, the biggest prize of the day, said they trusted Biden more than Sanders to handle a major crisis, according to exit polls. The polling in Michigan showed about half of voters trusted Biden in a crisis, compared to one-third who most trusted Sanders, Bidens last viable rival in the race.In Washington, the state hit hardest by coronavirus and the second-largest state to vote on Tuesday, eight in 10 voters voiced concern about the outbreaks effects, with a plurality supporting Biden, according to the Edison Research exit polls. Both candidates called off planned rallies in Cleveland, Ohio, on Tuesday due to concerns over the coronavirus outbreak, which has rattled markets and prompted Democrats to criticize the Trump administrations response.The campaigns said they were following guidance from Ohio public health officials. Until now, Democratic candidates as well as Trump, 73, have largely continued to hold large-scale events despite the outbreak. A total of 352 of the nearly 4,000 delegates to Julys Democratic convention were up for grabs in the six states voting on Tuesday, with Michigan the biggest with 125 delegates.Since last weeks Super Tuesday romps, Biden has roared into the national lead in polling and delegates, knocked out all remaining viable rivals except Sanders and swept up a wave of endorsements from former contenders such as Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker. A Biden breakthrough in Michigan, along with his big victories in Missouri and Mississippi, could prove too much for Sanders to overcome. By the end of March, about two-thirds of the delegates up for grabs will be allocated.

This feels so much different than other public crises that have visited us across the decades because in those moments, sports was a salve, a Band-Aid, a way to help with the healing. President Roosevelt refused baseball’s offer to shut down during World War II specifically because of the diversion the games brought 154 times a year. In what became known as the “Green Light Letter,” Roosevelt insisted for baseball’s commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, that if anything baseball represented an essential part of what the nation was fighting for.

Muhammad Ali used to say that he "floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee." After whipping Ottawa (Marquette) in two sets Monday evening, St. Mary's is floating like a butterfly all the way to state.       The Saints handled the Crusaders 25-13, 25-12 to win the Class 1A St. Mary's Sectional and will next play in the state quarterfinals Friday.       "They have stickers, right now (the theme) is 'sting like a bee,' so I gave them these little bees -- they're worker bees -- and they were supposed to do their best," SMS head coach Betty Murphy. "They played so well at regional and I said, 'that was your best, go out and do your best' and that was it."       The sting delivered by the Saints on Marquette was fast and hard. Alex Robinson toed the service line to open the match and quickly reeled off five straight points -- four off aces. This forced a Marquette timeout. Robinson came out of the break and served another ace for a 6-0 lead.       St. Mary's served up 18 points for the match.       "Our servers were on top of it," Murphy said.       Sophia Karr served up two more aces before a Marquette added another point and made it 16-5 that led to another timeout for the visitors.       The Saints kept opening the lead, which eventually hit 22-8 after another Robinson ace.       Marquette did make a bit of a run, cutting the margin to 23-13 before Murphy spent a timeout. SMS got a sideout on a net serve, and then Jaden Lucas capped the first set with an ace.       The Crusaders scored a point on the first play of the second set, but that lead lasted until the next serve when the Saints got a sideout. Robinson served an ace and St. Mary's lead the rest of the way.       The rest of the match was rather one-sided, although Marquette did have one run that drew it to within four, at 12-9. Murphy used a timeout and the Saints came back to score eight of the next nine points for a 21-10 lead.       Key plays in the surge came with Lucas block that led to a Marquette timeout, and an Elena Krause kill for the first point coming out of the break.       A key factor for the Saints in this match was the constant movement that allowed the defense to work. SMS came out on top on all but one of the long rallies.       "The play on the floor was really well, that floor was just covered," Murphy said. "We had the floor totally balanced and that's what they were supposed to do. And, they were supposed to go after the ball and they did."       Robinson led the service attack for the Saints with 14 points, 9 coming on ace serves. She also had 2 kills. Maria Long had 7 points and Lucas collected 6 points (4 aces) and 1 block. Sophia Karr had 4 points and Krause, Gragert and Tessa Collins each had 1 points. Krause also had 3 kills.       St. Mary's is going into the state quarterfinals on a roll with a record of 21-0. Murphy said the Saints seem to be peaking. But she also said the job isn't finished.       "It's exactly what we want," Murphy said. "They're starting now to look for open areas, that's the thing we're working on now, to see where you can hit to, hit the seams.       "They have to move, that's the whole thing."       St. Mary's will play the winner of the Springfield (Little Flower) sectional match between host Little Flower and Hartsburg-Emden in the first quarterfinal Friday (4:30 p.m.) at Bloomington Junior High.

“I would know the precise time of death, because the lights would go on and off,” he said. “And I cannot stop it. All I can say is this: I’ll see you soon.”                                    Several other friends died by suicide while on death row. He, too, considered suicide, and bought material to make a rope from a corrections officer.                                    After making the rope, Meléndez-Colón said, he went to sleep and dreamed about being a child, swimming in the ocean with dolphins around him and his mother waving to him from the beach. He said he woke up and flushed the rope down the toilet. From then on, every time he thought about suicide, he would give himself one more night, and on that night he said he would dream beautiful dreams, giving him hope.                                    Meléndez-Colón was also encouraged by letters, especially one written by his mother. It said she prayed the rosary for him every day, and that she believed a miracle would happen and he would be freed because God knew he was innocent.                                    “Eight months and one day later, the miracle came true,” he said.                                    When he was freed, the other inmates on death row cheered and whistled. They told him not to forget about them, and to take care of his mother, who they’d heard so much about.                                    As he left the prison, a reporter asked what he wanted to do.                                    “I said, ‘I want to see the moon. I want to see stars. I want to walk on grass. I want to hold a baby in my arms. And of course, I told her, I want to talk to some beautiful women,” he said with a glimmer in his eyes.                                    Meléndez-Colón received $100, a pair of jeans and a shirt as compensation after his release. The real killer, Meléndez-Colón said, was a confidential informant who died in an officer-involved shooting about two years after the murder.                                    Meléndez-Colón lives in New Mexico with his wife and speaks to groups and legislative bodies, asking them to abolish the death penalty. He told those in attendance to write to their legislators.                                    “We can release an innocent man from prison, but we can never release an innocent man from the grave. Please join me in my dream,” he told the students. “You are a part of it.”

Technical chart claims that CSI Compressco LP (CCLP) would settle between $1.36/share to $1.57/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $0.93 mark, then the market for CSI Compressco LP becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $0.7 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -0.32. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

Dear Dave,   We live in Colorado, and we need some advice on protecting our assets. My wife is a teacher, and I'm a nurse. We make around $180,000 a year combined, and we're set to pay off our home next month. We also have two teenagers who are both driving, so we were wondering about the best way to protect everything if one of them has an accident and we get sued, or something else tragic happens.   Spencer


  Dear Spencer,   With your income, and the stage you're in when it comes to wealth building, I think it's time to add an umbrella policy. This is a liability policy, and you could probably buy an extra million in liability coverage for around $250 a year. It attaches to the liability policy that's already part of your homeowners and car insurance.   With a couple of teenage drivers in the house, it might run a little more than $250, but I wouldn't think it would be much more, if any. It would just add an extra million to the mix, just in case someone decided they were going to come after you because of a bad situation.   As you continue building wealth later, like if you get into real estate and start buying rental properties, make sure you put those in a limited liability company (LLC). You're not there quite yet, but it's always a good idea to plan ahead and do whatever you can to keep the size of the target on your back relatively small.   Dave


  Control your own destiny   Dear Dave,   I have a pension plan that will pay me 80% of my top three highest years' income. Should I continue to invest 15% towards retirement? I will top out at $79,000 yearly, and I plan on retiring in 28 years.   Jordan


  Dear Jordan,   You should always put 15% of your income into retirement once you reach Baby Step 4. I would never count on a pension as my only retirement income, because the truth is many pension funds are very poorly managed.   You'll probably get the pension when the time comes. I'm not predicting it will go broke or anything like that, but there's no way I would leave the financial state of my retirement in other people's hands. That's exactly what you're doing when your plan is to count on a pension or Social Security. With Roth IRAs, 401(k)s and so forth, you're building wealth that you control.   You have to control the controllables, Jordan. There are plenty of things in our lives we have no control over whatsoever, but you have to take charge of the stuff you can control in order to win. Building wealth is one of those things!   Dave

Joe Biden was projected to cruise to wins in Democratic presidential contests in Missouri and Mississippi on Tuesday, striking an early blow against rival Bernie Sanders on a day when six states made their choices in the race to challenge U.S. President Donald Trump. Biden, the former vice president under Barack Obama and a heavy favorite over Sanders in both states, was projected to win Mississippi and Missouri by Edison Research and television networks based on exit polls and early results.The projections came as polls closed in the two states, along with North Dakota. Biden, 77, was looking to take a big step toward the nomination to face the Republican Trump in the Nov. 3 election after becoming the front-runner with a series of sweeping wins over Sanders in last weeks Super Tuesday contests.With Michigan the days biggest prize, Sanders, a democratic socialist and U.S. senator from Vermont, hoped an upset win there would keep his dwindling White House hopes alive. Sanders, 78, won a stunning upset over Hillary Clinton in Michigan in 2016 that ensured a long nominating fight - something Biden hopes to avoid this time. A total of 352 of the nearly 4,000 delegates to Julys Democratic convention were up for grabs in the six states voting on Tuesday, with Michigan the biggest with 125 delegates.A Biden breakthrough in Michigan, along with his big victories in Missouri and Mississippi, could prove too much for Sanders to overcome. By the end of March, about two-thirds of the delegates will be allocated. With 8 of the precincts reporting in Michigan, Biden was ahead with 52 versus 44 for Sanders.Biden was powered to the early victories on Tuesday by strong support from a broad coalition of groups, including women, African Americans, those aged 45 and older, and all but the very liberal, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research. As in earlier states, Bidens support was especially strong among black voters. In Mississippi, where two-thirds of the electorate was African-American, Biden won more than eight of every 10 black voters.Washington and Idaho also held contests on Tuesday. There was no immediate projection for North Dakota, and polls close later in the three other states. As fears spread about the coronavirus, voters in Michigan said they trusted Biden more than Sanders to handle a major crisis, according to exit polls.The polling in Michigan showed about half of voters more trusted Biden in a crisis, compared to one-third who more trusted Sanders, Bidens last viable rival in the race. In Washington, the state hit hardest by coronavirus and the second-largest state to vote on Tuesday, eight in 10 voters voiced concern about the outbreaks effects, with a plurality supporting Biden, according to the Edison Research exit polls.Both candidates called off planned rallies in Cleveland, Ohio, on Tuesday due to concerns over the coronavirus outbreak, which has rattled markets and prompted Democrats to criticize the Trump administrations response. The campaigns said they were following guidance from Ohio public health officials. Until now, Democratic candidates as well as Trump, 73, have largely continued to hold large-scale events despite the outbreak.Since last weeks Super Tuesday romps, Biden has roared into the national lead in polling and delegates, knocked out all remaining viable rivals except Sanders and swept up a wave of endorsements from former contenders such as Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker.

UK employees have already started to get statutory sick pay from the first day off work, to help contain coronavirus.


  But that money is not available to the self-employed, a group of about five million people. This has led to fears that these workers may struggle to make ends meet, and that those on zero-hours contracts may risk going into work when they shouldn't, helping the virus to spread.


  The chancellor has suggested he may announce temporary measures to support people in this position.


  This could include making sure benefits like universal credit and Employment and Support Allowance are available "quickly and effectively".


  It may also mean waiving requirements for sick notes or in-person benefits interviews.

PROSSER, Wash. - The the City of Prosser has decided to suspend City programs because of a possible exposure to the coronavirus.


  On Monday, March 9, the City received information there was a sight chance that a person at the Community Center, located at 1231 Dudley Ave., could have been exposed to COVID-19. According to a news release, the potential exposure comes from a possible transference from a site outside Benton County via a patron of the facility.


  According to City Officials, the person who may have been exposed has no symptoms at this time.


  Working with the Benton-Franklin Health Department the City of Prosser decided to suspend City programs while it works to sanitize the facility. This is a precautionary measure only, taken to ensure the safety of all citizens. The City has reached out to its facility partners and advised them of the situation and allowed them to determine whether to continue or suspend their programs based on the level of risk.


  According to the city, The Senior Citizens Club has posted updates on their program activities on their Facebook page. Meals on Wheels is still operating and will be providing meals. Please check the Prosser Meals on Wheels Facebook page for more information and updates.


  The City of Prosser expects to resume programs at the Community Center next week. “We want to stress that this is simply a precaution and thank you for your patience” Steve Zetz, Community Development Director.

And I spent a lot of time in the training Dojo just getting a feel for the weapons and moves. It hurls terms and phrases at you like Ki, Anima, Amrita, Kodama, and Yokai, and the uninitiated will almost certainly struggle to keep up at times, and by the time you reach the first boss - which comes very early on - you'll probably feel overwhelmed. Veterans of the first game will have an easier journey, but it's still no nature walk. Bear with it though, and when it all clicks you'll find that the complexity is essential to Nioh 2's personality.

New York's governor announced Tuesday he is sending the National Guard into a New York City suburb to help fight what is believed to be the nation's biggest cluster of coronavirus cases -- one of the most dramatic actions yet to control the outbreak in the U.S.


   


  The move came as health authorities contended with alarming concentrations of the disease on both sides of the country and scattered cases in between.


   


  Schools, houses of worship and large gathering places will be shuttered for two weeks in a "containment area" centered in New Rochelle, and the troops will scrub surfaces and deliver food to the zone, which extends a mile in all directions from a point near a synagogue connected to some of the cases, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said.


   


  "It is a dramatic action, but it is the largest cluster of cases in the country," Cuomo said. "The numbers are going up unabated, and we do need a special public health strategy."


   


  New Rochelle is at the center of an outbreak of 108 cases in Westchester County, out of 173 identified statewide. New York City has 36 cases, while its population is more than 100 times that of New Rochelle.


   


  In Oakland, California, meanwhile, thousands of increasingly bored and restless passengers aboard a cruise ship struck by the coronavirus waited their turn to get off the vessel and go to U.S. military bases or back to their home countries for two weeks of quarantine. In Washington state, where at least 19 deaths have been connected to a Seattle-area nursing home, Gov. Jay Inslee announced new rules for screening health care workers and limiting visitors.


   


  "If we assume there are 1,000 or more people who have the virus today … the number of people who are infected will double in five to eight days," he warned.


   


  The virus has infected over 700 people in the U.S. and killed at least 27, with one state after another recording its first infections in quick succession. New Jersey recorded its first coronavirus death.


   


  In California, passengers from the coronavirus-stricken Grand Princess were allowed off the vessel and walked to the bottom of a ramp, where masked officials in yellow protective gear and blue plastic gloves took their temperature and led them to a tent for more screening before they lined up to board a bus.


   


  After days of being forced to idle off the Northern California coast, the ship docked Monday at Oakland with about 3,500 passengers and crew, including at least 21 who tested positive for the new virus.


   


  "We're trying to stay calm and were trying to stay positive, but it's getting harder and harder. They can't make up their minds how to keep us safe," said passenger Beryl Ward, 77, of Santa Fe, New Mexico.


   


  The slow evacuation of the 951-foot (290-meter) ship began Monday with several hundred people let off the ship. About two dozen people who needed acute medical care were taken off first, though it was unclear how many of them were infected, California emergency authorities said. Also, more than 200 Canadians on board were flown to a military base in their country, Canadian officials said.


   


  On the ship, about 2,000 passengers, including hundreds of Californians, were still aboard Tuesday morning..


   


  Authorities said foreign passengers would be flown home, while U.S. passengers would be flown or bused to military bases in California, Texas and Georgia for testing and 14-day quarantines.


   


  The Grand Princess ship had been held off the coast since last week because of evidence that it was the breeding ground for more than 20 infections tied to a previous voyage. Passengers were mostly confined to their cabins.


   


  But Ward's cabin mate, Carolyn Wright, 63, also of Santa Fe, said she looked out her cabin window as passengers lined up to depart and also saw people in yellow protective clothing, gloves and hazardous materials suits.


   


  "They were queuing up the passengers like cattle," Wright said. "Everybody was bunched up. They were physically touching each other and they were backed up along the gangplank."


   


  She added: "I'm just totally freaked out by that. It's outrageous. If that's safe, then why were we stuck in our rooms? It's been stressed for the past five days that we're not to have any contact with any other passengers?"


   


  About 1,100 crew members, 19 of whom tested positive for the virus, will be quarantined and treated aboard the ship, which will dock elsewhere after passengers are unloaded, Gov. Gavin Newsom said. He and Oakland's mayor sought to reassure people that no passengers would be exposed to the public before completing quarantine.


   


  Another Princess ship, the Diamond Princess, was quarantined for two weeks in Yokohama, Japan, last month because of the virus. Ultimately, about 700 of the 3,700 people aboard became infected in what experts pronounced a public health failure.


   


  Elsewhere around the country, the United Nations said it will close its headquarters in New York to the public and suspend all guided tours. On Wall Street, stocks climbed higher during the day, recouping some of their staggering losses from the day before,


   


  For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. Most people recover in a matter of weeks, as has happened with three-quarters of those infected in mainland China.

Kansas farmers are known for the resiliency.


   


  Between tariffs, tweets, trade wars and unfavorable weather, the agricultural industry as a whole has faced plenty of hardships in recent years. Each week, we see stories about family farms foreclosing, increased need for mental health care in the ag industry due to stress and ever-shifting commodity markets.


   


  Despite all of this, Kansas was able to show some growth in its exports in 2019.


   


  The Topeka Capital-Journal's Tim Carpenter reported Kansas exports of soybean, corn and sorghum paired with a surge in radio navigational equipment sales combined to increase the value of goods shipped out of the country to $11.6 billion in 2019.


   


  The Kansas Department of Commerce said exports expanded 0.2% over 2018 levels.


   


  This is wonderful news. These numbers prove the Kansas work ethic still means something. They prove that Kansas farmers have things to offer and that adaptability and versatility can pay off.


   


  We hope our farmers take moment to celebrate. Even it's a short moment.


   


  "Seeing Kansas exports rise in the face of global headwinds like trade disputes, aviation difficulties and Brexit is heartening," David Toland, the state commerce secretary told The Capital-Journal. "Kansans should be proud they are outperforming the national trend."


   


  Nationally, the United States experienced a 1.2% reduction in exports to $1.64 trillion.


   


  The heartland, on the whole, received a somewhat mixed bag for their exports.


   


  Carpenter reported that in Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and Oklahoma the average state export value last year was $9.3 billion. Percentage shift in exports among border states from 2018 to 2019: Oklahoma, up 0.2%; Colorado, down 2.7%; Nebraska, down 6.2%; Missouri, down 7.8%. Among our neighbors, Kansas clearly came out on top.


   


  That's a nice feeling on one end, but we feel for the struggling farmers across the country.


   


  Kansas' beef, wheat and aviation industries have long been the boon for the Kansas economy. Unfortunately this year, those markets aren't as strong as they've been in the past and while they're critical to our state's success -- and likely always will be -- it's nice to see other exports picking up the slack.


   


  The biggest surprise might be the navigational equipment exports that reached $240 million, a 75% climb from $137 million in 2018. Kudos to those who helped bring on this change.


   


  We are confident that Kansans will find a way to stay the course in 2020.

However, if the stock price goes below the $3.23 mark, then the market for Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc. becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $3.11 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -0.48. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

  “Though we look at Maeve’s accomplishments and stand in wonder, the last couple of weeks of being back in the hospital have reminded us that in no way are we out of the woods,” the Haldimand County girl’s mother, Gloria Field, said in an update on the family’s Go Fund Me page.


  On Monday, it was exactly a year since Maeve, who was then four years old, and her family were leaving a store in Hagersville with supplies to build an herb garden. As they made their way down the sidewalk, Maeve was hit and dragged under a runaway vehicle travelling in reverse. The 80-year-old female driver was charged.


  Maeve’s father, Ian, was able to extricate her and together they were rushed by a stranger to West Haldimand General Hospital in Hagersville.


  Injured from head to toe, Maeve’s left arm and right leg suffered irreparable damage and parts of both limbs were amputated. She also lost sight in her left eye. She spent 130 days in hospital in Hamilton.


  “Among the replay of images that day affords my husband and I as part of our PTSD is the memory of an overarching and powerful energy that told me Maeve was going to live through this,” said Field.


  “I believed with every fibre of my motherhood that I knew Maeve well enough that not even being run over by and pinned under a car was going to stand in the way of what she was brought on this earth to do.”


  In her post, Field said her daughter was back in hospital this week for surgery to remove facial hardware and experienced complications that required two more surgeries — so far.


  “She is still very much in recovery mode.”


  But Field talks much about moving forward in the face of tragedy, calling her family’s approach “post-traumatic growth.”


  “There’s been lots of good stuff, especially the wonderful people and professionals we have had the chance to meet and work with,” she said.


  “There’s nary an anesthetist on the roster Maeve hasn’t met after enduring around, honestly, probably 100 hours of sedation/surgery since the accident.”


  As of Tuesday, Maeve’s Go Fund Me fundraiser was at about $146,500 of its $150,000 goal. All the money is going toward her care. Donations continue to be accepted.


  Field expressed her gratitude for overwhelming support from family, friends, strangers and the medical teams at West Haldimand General where Ian carried his critically injured daughter into the emergency room, and at Hamilton’s McMaster Children’s Hospital.


  Field said her daughter is “helping us keep things in perspective.”


  “What most people claim to be problems are not problems whatsoever. Put one hand in your pocket and try to zip up your hoodie. Get in a wheelchair, with that hand in your pocket still and try to get around your house or work or school. Use the bathroom. Put on your own prostheses. Oh, don’t forget to close one eye and remove half the teeth from your mouth while you’re at it,” she said.


  “From where I get to stand as this amazing guru’s mother, I see possibility. I see how when people like Maeve are empowered instead of pitied, they can shine bright and have amazing successes.


  “Maeve is setting an example for the rest of us.”

Joe Biden was projected to cruise to wins in Democratic presidential contests in Missouri and Mississippi on Tuesday, striking an early blow against rival Bernie Sanders on a day when six states made their choices in the race to challenge U.S. President Donald Trump. Biden, the former vice president under Barack Obama and a heavy favorite over Sanders in both states, was projected to win Mississippi and Missouri by Edison Research and television networks based on exit polls and early results.                    The projections came as polls closed in the two states, along with North Dakota. Biden, 77, was looking to take a big step toward the nomination to face the Republican Trump in the Nov. 3 election after becoming the front-runner with a series of sweeping wins over Sanders in last week's Super Tuesday contests.                    With Michigan the day's biggest prize, Sanders, a democratic socialist and U.S. senator from Vermont, hoped an upset win there would keep his dwindling White House hopes alive. Sanders, 78, won a stunning upset over Hillary Clinton in Michigan in 2016 that ensured a long nominating fight - something Biden hopes to avoid this time. A total of 352 of the nearly 4,000 delegates to July's Democratic convention were up for grabs in the six states voting on Tuesday, with Michigan the biggest with 125 delegates.                    A Biden breakthrough in Michigan, along with his big victories in Missouri and Mississippi, could prove too much for Sanders to overcome. By the end of March, about two-thirds of the delegates will be allocated. With 8% of the precincts reporting in Michigan, Biden was ahead with 52% versus 44% for Sanders.                    Biden was powered to the early victories on Tuesday by strong support from a broad coalition of groups, including women, African Americans, those aged 45 and older, and all but the very liberal, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research. As in earlier states, Biden's support was especially strong among black voters. In Mississippi, where two-thirds of the electorate was African-American, Biden won more than eight of every 10 black voters.                    Washington and Idaho also held contests on Tuesday. There was no immediate projection for North Dakota, and polls close later in the three other states. As fears spread about the coronavirus, voters in Michigan said they trusted Biden more than Sanders to handle a major crisis, according to exit polls.                    The polling in Michigan showed about half of voters more trusted Biden in a crisis, compared to one-third who more trusted Sanders, Biden's last viable rival in the race. In Washington, the state hit hardest by coronavirus and the second-largest state to vote on Tuesday, eight in 10 voters voiced concern about the outbreak's effects, with a plurality supporting Biden, according to the Edison Research exit polls.                    Both candidates called off planned rallies in Cleveland, Ohio, on Tuesday due to concerns over the coronavirus outbreak, which has rattled markets and prompted Democrats to criticize the Trump administration's response. The campaigns said they were following guidance from Ohio public health officials. Until now, Democratic candidates as well as Trump, 73, have largely continued to hold large-scale events despite the outbreak.                    Since last week's Super Tuesday romps, Biden has roared into the national lead in polling and delegates, knocked out all remaining viable rivals except Sanders and swept up a wave of endorsements from former contenders such as Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker. Biden, who has touted the Obama administration's decision to bail out the auto industry, made a morning campaign stop at Detroit's first new auto assembly plant in decades, owned by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.                    "Unions built the country," Biden shouted through a bullhorn. "You're the best damn workers in the world." But his visit was marred by a clash with one worker who suggested he planned to confiscate Americans' guns. Biden, whose propensity to veer off script occasionally causes self-inflicted wounds, snapped at the worker using an obscenity.                    Sanders has attacked Biden for supporting international trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement, which is unpopular among many of Michigan's workers who say it has cost the state jobs. As Biden left the plant, video showed some workers chanting, "Trump!"

The U.S. sanctions on Iran's oil sector are impacting the Islamic Republic's ability to potentially increase production in the long term if the U.S.-Iran tensions subside and sanctions ease.   Iran relies 100 percent on imports for oil rig equipment, but the sanctions have stifled such imports from the U.S. and Europe, Mohsen Mihandoust, a director at Iran's Society of Petroleum Engineers, told Reuters in an interview published on Tuesday. Due to the sanctions, at least a quarter of the oil rigs, or 40 out of 160, in Iran are now out of work--either idle or under repairs, Reuters reported, citing financial documents and sources in the industry. Iran's oil rigs will be inefficient or very old within the next five years, according to Reuters' sources. With the U.S. sanctions in place, Iran doesn't have many options to repair rigs in the short to medium term because it cannot import spare parts. Even in the event of the U.S. lifting the sanctions, Iran's oil industry may need years to recover its oil production to levels last seen just before the sanctions were imposed in May 2018. The U.S. sanctions on Iran's oil industry and exports have significantly cut Iranian oil exports, as the United States ended in May last year all waivers for all of Iran's oil buyers and is going after anyone dealing with Iranian oil. Iran continues to export oil, using all back channels it can think of. However, the primary buyer of Iranian oil under the 'no exemption' sanctions, China, is experiencing an unprecedented slowdown in oil demand due to the coronavirus outbreak, so it's not clear how much oil Iran can place with its key customer in the coming months. Meanwhile, the U.S. is now going after Iran's floating storage. Washington plans to issue warnings to oil shippers, insurers, and port authorities that storing Iranian crude oil will bring the wrath of U.S. sanctions, a U.S. State Department official said on Monday.

KENOWA HILLS -- The Coldwater Cardinal gymnastics team traveled to Kenowa Hills High School on Saturday for the MHSAA Gymnastics Regional competition. The Cardinals finished their season in top form, scoring their highest team score in school history with 137.575 points. There were over 85 gymnasts competing in two divisions at the Regional and the top eight gymnasts in individual events for each division advanced to the State Finals competition, as well as the top six individuals in the all-around.


  Four Cardinals earned All-Regional honors for their performances and advanced to the state finals competition by finishing in the top eight in their events.


  The Rockford/Sparta cooperative team claimed the regional title, taking first place with 145.8 points. The Jackson area co-op team took second (143.025) followed by the Forest Hills United cooperative team (142.15). Lowell High School finished in fourth place with 140.525 points and all four teams will advance to the state finals team competition on Friday. Coldwater's team finished in a solid 5th place in front of teams from Western, Escanaba, Kenowa Hills, Marquette, and Negaunee high schools.


  Coldwater opened their competition on the balance beam where the intense pressure of the competition challenged their mental focus. The team pushed through and scored a total of 33.65 points with four stuck routines for the day.


  Coldwater was led by Abby Travelbee who collected 8.525 points in spite of a fall on one of her bonus skills. The junior finished in ninth place for Division One, just missing the state finals berth by 0.15 points. Next in line was Leah Goodwin who finished in tenth place for her efforts at 8.45 points while McKenna Hantz put together a personal best performance in eleventh place for her stuck routine at 8.375 points. Randi Dudek finished her beam season in thirteenth place for Division One, followed by Layla Schoch.


  Coldwater had four Cardinals compete in the Division Two balance beam competition, led by senior Kelani Philipp who finished her balance beam career with a personal best performance and a stuck routine after scoring 8.3 points to tie for seventeenth place. Sydney Gallop and Shelby Taber stuck their final beam routines of the season and will look to return next year for a repeat at the Regional. Kassidy Shaw also performed on the beam for Coldwater.


  "The beam was a rough start for us and we had to battle back after that first event," commented Coldwater head coach Kim Nichols. "Overall the girls did all right and the team was still able to break the record at the end of the day, but it is tough to shake off sometimes."


  Coldwater moved to the floor exercise for their second event, posting a score of 35.45 points.


  Two individuals were given All-Region honors for their routines, including Layla Schoch and Randi Dudek. Schoch was the top scorer for the Cardinals, earning a fifth place finish with her mark of 9.05 points while Dudek was right behind her teammate with a sixth place tie at 9.025 points, a personal best performance for the freshman.


  Once again Abby Travelbee finished just outside of the medals for her score of 8.8 points, good enough for ninth place. Leah Goodwin had an uncharacteristic fall in her first tumbling pass that cost her 0.7 points in deductions and a chance to perform in the finals. The sophomore finished in thirteenth place overall with her mark of 8.575 points. McKenna Hantz was right behind with her second best score of the season at 8.525 points, good enough for fourteenth place. Kelani Phillipp performed the most difficult routine of her career finishing in a tie for seventeenth place with a season best performance of 8.3 points, an amazing feat for the gymnast who battled back from a severe injury last season. Freshman newcomer Sydney Gallop posted 8.15 points followed by a personal best score from junior Shelby Taber. Kassidy Shaw had a fall during her final tumble pass but still posted a Regional mark of 7.85 points.


  "We had some great floor performances today," said Nichols. "It is amazing to look out at what the girls are putting on the floor and see just how far they've come all year."


  After the midday break Coldwater was up next on the vault where the team put together a historic performance.


  Three individual gymnasts successfully performed Tsukahara vaults for the first time in the history of the Coldwater gymnastics program. The team tied their floor event total, posting 35.045 points. The tally was the third highest vault team score of the day, behind only Rockford and Jackson.


  Leah Goodwin and Randi Dudek earned All-Region honors for their efforts as Goodwin earned a personal best score for her piked position Tsuk vault, scoring 9.425 points and second place overall. Dudek also posted a personal best mark, collecting 8.925 points and finishing in a tie for fifth place for her efforts.


  Layla Schoch posted a season best of 8.65 points for her first time performing a Tsukahara vault. The sophomore struggled with her landing, but still finished in tenth place and hopes to perfect the skill for next season. Hantz and Travelbee tied for thirteenth place with their mark of 8.425 points.


  In Division Two, Kassidy Shaw collected 8.45 points for her efforts as the freshman debuted a new half on full off at the Regional and will also look to perfect her skill for next year. Shelby Taber posted a solid 8.25 points, just shy of her personal best. Kelani Philipp earned 8.05 points for her final performance.


  "Vault was by far my favorite event of the day," explained Nichols. "It was really exciting to have so many high level vaults and the energy was just electric."


  Coldwater closed out their 2020 season on the uneven bars, tallying 33.025 points on the event.


  Abby Travelbee led the Cardinals on the apparatus, collecting 8.55 points to finish in fifth place and earn All-Region honors on the Bars.


  Dudek and Goodwin tied for tenth place with their mark of 8.175 points while McKenna Hantz finished in eleventh place with her score of 8.125 points, followed close behind by Layla Schoch who collected 8.00 points, good enough for twelfth place.


  In Division Two, Kelani Phillipp tied for twenty-fourth place with her score of 7.55 points.


  "We had a very solid finish with our uneven bar routines," noted Nichols. "It has always been a weak spot for our team, but they have proven that we are just as strong on the bars now as we are on the beam, so I am proud of the strides they have made on the event."


  Coldwater tallied more than 30 points on the uneven bars in all but one meet during the entire season, demonstrating their improvement on the event, given there were several years when the team would work all season to score 30 points on the bars.


  In the all-around competition only the top six individuals advance to perform all four events at the state finals. Coldwater's Leah Goodwin finished in eighth place overall with her tally of 34.625 points, just 0.8 away from the finals berth. Abby Travelbee finished in ninth place with her total score of 34.3 points while Randi Dudek put together a personal best performance and was twelfth overall at 33.675. McKenna Hantz finished in thirteenth place and also turned in her top four performances of her career and posted a personal record for her tally of 33.45 points. Layla Schoch was fourteenth place for her all- around total of 31.45 points while senior Kelani Philipp finished her Cardinal gymnastics career with her best ever all-around total of 32.2 points.


  The MHSAA State Finals Gymnastics tournament will take place on Friday and Saturday at Rockford High School. The individual finals competition will begin at noon on Saturday.

Columbia Mayor Chaz Molder on Tuesday called on Tennessee Department of Health to release the locations of the state's newly identified cases of the COVID-19 virus.


   


  Molder took his stance after at least three more cases of the virus where identified in Middle Tennessee on Tuesday. With at least seven people having been diagnosed with the virus in the state, the Tennessee Department of Health began restricting information about new cases and omitting the names of counties where cases have been confirmed.


   


  "This is a time to be sensible, but lack of information leads to distrust," Molder said. "Now is the time to release the location(s) so that those of us on the ground can prepare and respond accordingly. Our citizens deserve to know -- for their own safety and the safety of others. While there is no reason to panic, and all the reason to listen to medical advice, there is also reason to rely upon the government to help us through this medical emergency -- that includes relying on the government to be transparent and effective. The state's decision does not promote transparency nor efficiency."


   


  After initially identifying cases by county, the Tennessee Health Department said it would no longer release county-level data at the start of the week.


   


  "Keeping this information quite, in my opinion, will not only do very little to contain the spread, but it will also do very little to contain the concern shared by many of our residents regarding the virus and what they need to be doing to prepare," Molder told The Daily Herald. "I know this, when the time comes that there is a confirmed case here in our community, the public will demand action and will expect a response, as they should. By failing to keep the public and local government appraised of the recent cases and where they are located, it inhibits our ability to plan prepare and implement."


   


  Shelley Walker, a spokeswoman for the health department, said previously said the agency would only identify the grand division where each new case was located.


   


  That decision has been met with criticism from Democrats as well as an organization that promotes open government in the state.


   


  The Tennessee Coalition for Open Government went to Twitter urging citizens to pressure state officials to change course.


   


  "The public needs to call the state of TN on this," the social media post reads. "The least populous county in Tennessee has 5,000 people. Saying that alerting the public of a COVID-19 case in a small county would identify that person is just not believable. Come on."


   


  Senate Minority Leader Jeff Yarbro, D-Nashville, also shared his concerns with the move on social media.


   


  "The state needs to err on the side of transparency right now," Yarbro said on Twitter. "And should be trying to build trust. Unless there is a compelling public health rationale, and none was cited, the Department should reverse this decision."


   


  In East Tennessee, Knox County Health Department Director Dr. Martha Buchanan said on Tuesday that local officials there will announce when the first case of the new coronavirus is confirmed in Knox County, and then regularly update the public on the number of cases detected, The Knoxville News Sentinel, a sister publication of The Daily Herald, reported.


   


  "We'll follow what we have always followed when we've had outbreaks like this, because we … have had outbreaks like this in the past," Buchanan said at a news conference Tuesday. "We generally announce our first case so the public is aware there's a case in the county, and then after that we just do case counts in regular updates."

LAWRENCE -- The factoid took Udoka Azubuike by surprise.


   


  The same could be said for the Kansas basketball senior standout's head coach.


   


  Azubuike, the top-ranked Jayhawks' 7-foot center and the newly crowned Big 12 player of the year, will be appearing in his first Big 12 Tournament this week after three years of hard-luck circumstances -- Azubuike suffered season- ending wrist injuries midway through his freshman and junior campaigns, and as a sophomore, he missed the league's annual postseason event with a sprained MCL in his left knee.


   


  Asked Monday about whether playing in the Big 12 Tournament for the first time will serve as added motivation, Azubuike reacted with surprise.


   


  "For real?" Azubuike asked. "You right. You right. Dang. Oh yeah, you right."


   


  He continued.


   


  "For sure it's going to be exciting," Azubuike said. "It's going to be an exciting experience for me. I haven't really thought about it, for real, (that) this is my first Big 12 Tournament for real. I mean, I'm excited and I'm looking forward to it."


   


  More than aware of the bad hand Azubuike has been dealt from a health standpoint, Bill Self nevertheless was also surprised when relayed the tidbit, though he believes Sunday's player of the year honor from the Big 12 coaches will serve as Azubuike's biggest driving force this week.


   


  "I did not realize that. How about that? Four years and it's the first time he's been able to play in the tournament," Self said. "I don't know, I would think he'd be extra motivated in large part because of what happened (Sunday). That was really cool what happened (Sunday)."


   


  Still, it remains to be seen just how much action Azubuike -- and several key Jayhawk teammates, for that matter -- will see in what has shaped up to be a low-stakes final tune-up for the NCAA Tournament.


   


  Compared to most years, the Jayhawks (28-3) appear to have less on the line in this particular Big 12 Tournament -- ESPN bracketologist Joe Lunardi declared over the weekend that Self's squad is a lock for the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA Tournament, having "lapped the field at this point," he said.


   


  Couple that with lingering afflictions the Jayhawks have battled throughout Big 12 play -- Azubuike's ankle sprain; Devon Dotson's hip pointer; Marcus Garrett's foot -- and KU's most important players could potentially see a reduction in minutes in what may turn out to be a three-games-in-three-days scenario.


   


  Besides the obvious mission of capturing another Big 12 trophy, continuing the momentum for a squad that has won 16 straight games is also a goal worth pursuing this week, Self said.


   


  "You know, if you lace 'em up you might as well win. If you're going to play you might as well win. At least that's the way everybody looks at it, not just us. Everybody looks at it that way," Self said. "Kids are competitive. I get a kick out of (people saying), 'Well, you know, guys may not play as hard if you don't need it as much.' Well if that's the case then you probably don't have the guys you wish you had.


   


  "So in our case I know we'll go over there and try. Doesn't mean we're going to play great, but I would like to see us be jacked, I would like to see us validate the regular season in the postseason. I would like to see those things."


   


  That said, there's one Big 12 Tournament reality that always seems to be true for the blue-blood program.


   


  "I also know that as soon as the last game is over, whenever that is, nobody will be talking about the Big 12 Tournament again," Self continued. "Everybody will be focused on the NCAA Tournament."


   


  Dotson is appearing in 34.9 minutes per game, with Ochai Agbaji (33.3), Garrett (32.2) and Azubuike (27.7) not far behind. The Big 12 Tournament may be an opportunity for freshman guard Tristan Enaruna (10.9 minutes per game) and junior forward Silvio De Sousa (8.2) to see extended usage.


   


  "I'd like for sure to be able to play them both, Tristan for sure and to be able to play Silvio. Yeah, for sure. I do hope that's the case," Self said. "I'm not going to make any bold predictions but I think that would be best for our team. So I think you could probably anticipate us at least attempting to do that."


   


  Regardless of how KU chooses to approach the Big 12 Tournament, Dotson at least appears invested in its outcome -- "Seasons not done with, so it's a big week," he said.


   


  KU begins its Big 12 Tournament run with a 1:30 p.m. Thursday quarterfinal against either Oklahoma State or Iowa State at Sprint Center in Kansas City, Mo.


   


  "It's a new season, third part of the season," Dotson said. "It's postseason now, so everybody's equal, everybody's going to give their best shot and so I mean if you're dominant in the regular season that's good and that's a good goal, but it's postseason time so it's all back to square one. So we've got to get it going."

Tuesday marked the first time voters weighed in on the primary since it effectively narrowed to a two-person race between Sanders and Biden. It showed that Sanders had yet to really broaden his appeal among African Americans after earlier setbacks in the South on Super Tuesday. Biden, meanwhile, kept up momentum after a dominant South Carolina victory.

Well, of course, it's important that there is consistency in pricing across the board. And we do supply to some companies, and there is map pricing across the board there.

There is a lot of complex organic chemistry in that process. So therefore, we do achieve, as you see, close to 60% gross margins as a Company. In order to do that, we do have to price around that level on a retail level. But we are constantly working on reducing our cost of goods. And there are -- that has been a very major initiative at the Company in the last few months, and will continue to be. And if we can continue to bring the price down on the cost of goods, we will experiment with some price testing at a retail level.

MONTGOMERY, Ala. (WSFA) - Rep. Steve Clouse, R-Ozark, filed an education lottery bill Tuesday with 70 co-sponsors that if passed would go to the ballot as a constitutional amendment for people to vote on.It would approve a paper-based lottery generating about $167 million each year according to Clouse. 50 percent of the proceeds would go toward the Frist Class Pre-K program and the other half for scholarships. Video lottery terminals would not be allowed.“It’s just time that we put this on the ballot again,” Clouse said.The bill also said it would not prohibit local laws prior to Jan. 1, 2005 that allowed charity bingo and pari-mutuel wagering on horse or dog racing.Gov. Kay Ivey created a Study Group on Gambling Policy earlier this year to gather the facts before lawmakers passed a lottery. The group dissolves in December of 2020.However, Clouse said he wants the lottery on the ballot for November.“There’s going to be a high turnout in November and that’s when you want to do something like this," said Clouse. "When you have the most voters going to the polls and we can get a clear indication if they do want to go with it or do not want to go with it.”Clouse said he wants the governor’s support. If the people approved a lottery in November, the governor would call a special session to set up a lottery corporation to run the operations.Copyright 2020 WSFA 12 News. All rights reserved.

It was reported that Democratic Party leaders were working behind the scenesto find an alternative to Sanders, a democratic socialist who has long labeled himself an independent. But black voters like the ones who pushed Biden to big victories in South Carolina, and then in Virginia, Alabama and North Carolina, aren’t The Establishment, and it would be a mistake to characterize them as moderate, or even, as certain pundits maintain, somewhat conservative. Rather than placing these votes along a straight continuum between the left and the right, it would be better to think about black voters in their own particular contexts.

Whether or not the prevention or easing of human suffering justifies the violation of sovereignty is an important question; while a serious engagement with it is outside the scope of this chapter, it shows the dilemma the UN might be experiencing when it comes to self-determination processes.

SHREVEPORT, La. - People from Northwest Louisiana interested in growing hemp got to learn more about the industry Tuesday.


  More than 100 people met at Carr, Riggs & Ingram CPA's and Advisors office in Shreveport to learn about industrial hemp regulations, licensing requirements, and they got to network.


  The industrial hemp program coordinator for the state explained the application process, and people got to ask her questions. Currently, there is one seed producer and one grower in the area.


  "We'll license as many people who want to grow or process, or do whatever there's no limit on the number of licenses that we're going to issue, or the number of acres that we're going to permit," said Angela Guidry, Louisiana Department of Agriculture & Forestry industrial hemp coordinator.


  Guidry said the state is expecting an influx of applications next month.


  "It does seem like a lot of people here want to do this. It's not an easy thing to do. Growing the crop is not without risks. Processing the crop is going to require a big capital investment, but we think that down the road there could be a big payoff for it," said Brandon Fail, Shreveport's economic development director.


  Growers are required to keep their hemp crops below .3% total THC. If it goes over, crops will be destroyed.

The COVID-19 fallout is happening so fast it’s hard to keep tabs on it all. From Italy locking down a nation of some 60 million people to New York deploying the National Guard to help contain the coronavirus in New Rochelle, government and public health officials are taking unprecedented peacetime measures to hinder the public’s movement. Federal officials want Americans to avoid cruise ships, and health officials want to limit social visits to nursing homes and assisted living centers. Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden canceled major rallies in Cleveland Tuesday night.                                    In San Diego, “social distancing” has led San Diego State University and Cal State San Marcos to consider — and University of California San Diego to move to — online courses, and the San Diego Opera to halt performances. Meanwhile, companies from Petco to Sempra Energy are suspending travel.                                    At the same time, the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department has begun assessing the newly arrested at intake for symptoms and travel history.                                    Perhaps most reassuring amid an outbreak that poses particular challenges for vulnerable populations like the elderly and those with underlying health conditions, the focus in California cities from San Diego to San Francisco has shifted to ensuring the coronavirus doesn’t take hold in homeless communities. In the Bay Area, public officials created a $5 million emergency fund and ordered better cleaning in shelters, resource centers and single-room occupancy hotels. San Francisco Mayor London Breed explained the problem succinctly, “The unfortunate reality for many people experiencing homelessness is that they’re unable to quarantine themselves if they have symptoms.”

Joe Biden was projected to win Michigan's Democratic presidential contest on Tuesday, taking a big step toward the nomination and dealing a crushing blow to rival Bernie Sanders' fading White House hopes. Biden, the former vice president under Barack Obama, also was projected to capture Missouri and Mississippi by Edison Research and television networks, as six states made their choices in the race to challenge U.S. President Donald Trump.                    The wins put Biden, 77, on a path to the nomination to face the Republican Trump in the Nov. 3 election after becoming the front-runner with a series of sweeping wins over Sanders, 78, in last week's Super Tuesday contests. Sanders, a democratic socialist and U.S. senator from Vermont, had hoped an upset win in Michigan would keep his dwindling White House hopes alive. But he appeared to fall far short, leaving the future of his White House bid up in the air.                    With 35% of the precincts reporting, Biden was leading in Michigan with 53% of the vote, ahead of 41% for Sanders. A Biden breakthrough in Michigan, along with his big victories in Missouri and Mississippi, could prove too much for Sanders to overcome. By the end of March, about two-thirds of the delegates will be allocated.                    A total of 352 of the nearly 4,000 delegates to July's Democratic convention were up for grabs in the six states voting on Tuesday, with Michigan the biggest with 125 delegates. The Democratic nominee will challenge the Republican Trump, 73, in a Nov. 3 election.

To suggest, as Vegter does, that Locke’s racism, in terms of his philosophy and his active involvement in English colonialism, and his personal investments in the slave trade, can be explained by the time in which Locke lived, carry no weight. Thomas Paine, who lived shortly after Locke, attacked African slavery in the clearest terms. In a 1775 essay, _African Slavery in America_ , Paine attacked slavery as an “execrable commerce” and “outrage against Humanity and Justice”.

FAIRBANK — The Fairbank City Council voted unanimously to accept the financial risk of offering email billing through its utility provider in hopes that enough people will sign up to make it make financial sense for the city, after some consideration.


  City staff said the change would cut down on postage but also the time required for mailings. Statements will come as a PDF attachment.


  Utility billing software company gWorks e-billing will cost the city $1,280 in the first year, which breaks down to a $500 startup fee and $780 additional yearly licensing cost.


  “Would we recover that expense in a year?” Councilman Ted Vorwald asked.


  “If we could get at lot of people to sign up, then yeah,” Clerk Brittany Fuller said. “If we could get 200 less stamps a month, that would at least cover this cost, then you would have to look at time spent.”


  With current postage for two 35-cent postcards a month, it’s estimated that email billing will save the city 70 cents per customer per month. At that rate, the number of utility customers needed for the city to break even on postage would be 153 customers enrolling in e-billing for 12 months — the $1,280 — which could drop down to 93 customers after that before the city would start to lose money on yearly licensing going forward — the $780.


  City staff attempted to gauge residents’ interest in e-billing by setting up a poll, but did not realize the constraints of the application.


  “We tried to create a poll [online], set it all up and submitted it, and it said max 40 votes,” Fuller said, explaining why a link was removed.


  Councilman Tyler Woods said he would use the e-bill.


  “I don’t feel like senior citizens would,” Councilwoman Tammy Erickson said, noting a loved one who pays their household bills is “still using a flip phone.”


  Erickson moved to go with ebilling.


  “I’ll second it,” Tyler Woods said, “with the exception that we want to make a big push right away [to] get people to sign up.”


  What will not change is the ways the city accepts payments.


  “If they get an email bill, they would still pay it all the same ways they do now, so there’s nothing changing with that,” Fuller said later. “It’s just going to be that they’ll receive the bill by email.”


  The city accepts payments from any financial institution through GovPayNet by debit and the four major credit cards for a sliding-scale fee, which is $1 for payments less than $38 and 2.65% for payments greater than $38.


  Many financial institutions offer automatic bill payment services, and customers may contact their bank or credit union for more information.


  The council favored the PDF e-bill statements over an option that cost more than twice as much in year one, that would have allowed customers to login to their billing history online.

WASHINGTON -- Speaker Nancy Pelosi told House Democrats on Tuesday that Congress should stay at work this week as "captains of the ship" despite the risk of coronavirus infection on Capitol Hill as lawmakers scramble under enormous pressure to respond to the epidemic. President Donald Trump was heading there to confer with Senate Republicans about his proposed payroll tax relief.


   


  Lawmakers were given new instructions on how to protect themselves at the Capitol, with the House's attending physician asking them to stop shaking hands or touching people during greetings -- he recommended the split-fingers Star Trek greeting instead. Trump met health insurers, seeking their cooperation in ensuring affordable medical care in the public-health emergency.


   


  With Congress planning to take its scheduled break next week, the time for action is short. Democrats are assembling an aid package for working families struggling to keep paychecks coming as the outbreak disrupts workplaces. Their plan counters one from Trump, who is proposing a payroll tax break, small- business loans and other steps.


   


  Crowds are the norm in the Capitol and handshakes are coin of the realm there, even between political foes. But about a half dozen lawmakers have placed themselves in quarantine after being exposed to someone who had the virus, and the norm has been upended.


   


  Still, Pelosi implored lawmakers to keep working to strengthen the country's defenses.


   


  "We are the captains of the ship," Pelosi said during the closed-door meeting, according to a person in the room unauthorized to discuss the private caucus publicly and granted anonymity. "We are the last to leave."


   


  Trump's top economic advisers will be on Capitol Hill later Tuesday to brief Senate Republicans on his plan to ask Congress to pass payroll tax relief and other quick measures. On Monday, the president told reporters he is seeking "very substantial relief" to the payroll tax. Trump also said he was seeking help for hourly-wage workers to ensure they're "not going to miss a paycheck" and "don't get penalized for something that's not their fault."


   


  But so far, the president's approach, based on tax breaks, is receiving a cool response from Democrats as well as Republicans from his own party who say it's too soon to consider fresh spending from Capitol Hill.


   


  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell opened the chamber saying only that Republicans "look forward to discussing" the ideas "so we can all consider the best ways to move forward." Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and adviser Larry Kudlow are expected at the weekly GOP lunch.


   


  The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, said the virus outbreak demands a "health care" solution. Democrats are proposing affordable testing, more unemployment benefits and paid leave for working families affected by the virus.


   


  "The administration seems to believe that the answer to any problem is another tax cut," Schumer said. "The best way to ensure economic security for the American people is to deal directly with the coronavirus itself.


   


  It was not immediately clear how Trump was aiming to provide assistance to employees weighing whether to stay home because of illness -- a crucial aim of public health officials seeking to curtail the spread of the virus.


   


  One mechanism, backed by the Trump-allied National Association of Manufacturers, involves a proposed tax credit for employers who pay employees who are quarantined.


   


  Trump stepped forward with the contours of an initiative Monday after markets dropped sharply and as the outbreak spread. markets recovered from some of the losses Tuesday, reacting positively to the prospects for an economic boost from Washington.


   


  Several Trump confidants have disclosed they are isolating themselves after potential exposure to the virus; one lawmaker traveled with the president from Florida on Air Force One on Monday; another was his just-tapped new chief of staff.


   


  The Securities and Exchange Commission, which monitors financial markets, encouraged employees at its Washington headquarters to work from home after an employee there had respiratory symptoms and was referred for coronavirus testing.


   


  And Defense Secretary Mark Esper postponed a trip to India, Pakistan and Uzbekistan that was to begin Monday, citing the coronavirus crisis, Pentagon press secretary Alyssa Farah said Tuesday. She said he would remain in the U.S to help manage the Pentagon response.


   


  At the Capitol, Democratic lawmakers were told by the House chief administrative officer behind closed doors that the office could support up to 10,000 staff members teleworking if need be. Laptop orders were being expedited and cyber-security measures reviewed.


   


  Trump returned to Washington on Monday accompanied by Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, who later went into a voluntary quarantine. He was one of several GOP lawmakers who were exposed to a person at last month's Conservative Political Action Conference who tested positive for the virus. His office said he was "mid-flight" on Air Force One when CPAC informed his staff that he had been in contact with the attendee who had the virus.


   


  Once the plane landed, Gaetz was immediately tested.


   


  Vice President Mike Pence, who also spoke at CPAC, said he has not been tested for the virus. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Trump has not been tested because he has not had "prolonged close contacts" with any patients and "does not have any symptoms."


   


  The White House has been convening meetings with an array of travel and healthcare industry representatives, and was set to host Wall Street executives at the White House on Wednesday to discuss the economic fallout of the epidemic.


   


  Vast numbers of visitors come to the Hill, especially at this time of year when advocacy groups arrange "fly-in" trips to lobby and speak to lawmakers, and school groups descend for tours.


   


  In one manifestation of lawmaking in the age of the coronavirus, Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., approached a Republican colleague on the House floor Monday for a routine congratulatory handshake after the chamber approved a bill expanding a visa program. "Shake or bump?" Neal asked Rep. Kelly Armstrong, R-N.D.


   


  The two men bumped elbows.

Joe Biden was projected to win Michigans Democratic presidential contest on Tuesday, taking a big step toward the nomination and dealing a crushing blow to rival Bernie Sanders fading White House hopes. Biden, the former vice president under Barack Obama, also was projected to capture Missouri and Mississippi by Edison Research and television networks, as six states made their choices in the race to challenge U.S. President Donald Trump.The wins put Biden, 77, on a path to the nomination to face the Republican Trump in the Nov. 3 election after becoming the front-runner with a series of sweeping wins over Sanders, 78, in last weeks Super Tuesday contests. Sanders, a democratic socialist and U.S. senator from Vermont, had hoped an upset win in Michigan would keep his dwindling White House hopes alive. But he appeared to fall far short, leaving the future of his White House bid up in the air.With 35 of the precincts reporting, Biden was leading in Michigan with 53 of the vote, ahead of 41 for Sanders. A Biden breakthrough in Michigan, along with his big victories in Missouri and Mississippi, could prove too much for Sanders to overcome. By the end of March, about two-thirds of the delegates will be allocated.A total of 352 of the nearly 4,000 delegates to Julys Democratic convention were up for grabs in the six states voting on Tuesday, with Michigan the biggest with 125 delegates. The Democratic nominee will challenge the Republican Trump, 73, in a Nov. 3 election.

Joe Biden delivered decisive wins in Missouri and Mississippi on Tuesday, dealing an early blow to Bernie Sanders on a night when six states were up for grabs. Both men were focused intensely on Michigan, the nights biggest prize. 	Thats where the Vermont senator scored an upset that lent much-needed credibility to his 2016 primary challenge of Hillary Clinton  and where President Donald Trumps victory four years was so narrow that Democrats are desperate to show they have the strength to flip it back.  	The former vice president made a final push there in recent days, rallying autoworkers and touting a fresh round of high-profile endorsements.Beyond Michigan, Sanders could get a boost in Idaho, North Dakota or Washington state, where polls havent yet closed. Even as the contours of the race took shape, the campaigns faced new uncertainty amid fears of the spreading coronavirus. Sanders and Biden both abruptly canceled public events in Ohio that were scheduled for Tuesday night. Sanders campaign said all future events would be decided on a case-by-case basis, while Biden called off a scheduled stop in Florida.  	The Democratic National Committee also said that Sundays debate between Sanders and Biden would be conducted without an audience.Tuesday marked the first time voters weighed in on the Democratic contest since it effectively narrowed to a two-person race between Sanders and Biden.  	It was a test of whether Sanders can broaden his appeal among African Americans after earlier setbacks in the South. Biden, meanwhile, sought to show that he can keep momentum going after his surprise Super Tuesday turnaround. As soon as polls closed in Mississippi and Missouri at 8 p.m. Eastern time, The Associated Press declared Biden the winner in both states Democratic presidential primary.The AP called Biden the winner even though state officials had yet to release any results from Tuesdays election. The news agency did so based on results from AP VoteCast, its wide-ranging survey of the American electorate. 	That election research captures the views of voters on whom they vote for, and why. The VoteCast survey showed Biden with a wide lead in both states. Importantly, Biden was leading in all parts of both states. He led among both men and women, as well as among both white voters and African American voters.With 125 delegates at stake, Michigan got most of the attention Tuesday. Trump won the state by only about 10,000 votes during the general election in 2016, and Democrats are eager to take it back. A win for Biden might show his party he can do it again against Trump in November. But Sanders presented himself as a credible alternative and aimed to block Biden from piling up a wide lead in delegates to the Democratic National Convention this summer in Milwaukee.Sanders has predicted victory in Michigan and scrapped a scheduled Mississippi stop to spend more time there. Biden went there less frequently, but sought late-breaking support there and toured an auto plant in Detroit on Tuesday. Youre the best damn workers in the world Biden shouted through a megaphone at the auto plant as workers in hard hats chanted, Joe Joe Biden ticked off the names of six former presidential rivals who have endorsed him just in the past week, saying he is the candidate that they think can win.  	The former vice president has campaigned in recent days with two of them, Sens. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, and appeared with Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. All three have been mentioned as possible vice presidential picks if Biden wins the nomination.The confidence Biden exudes is a remarkable turnaround for someone who just two weeks ago looked to be falling too far behind Sanders to catch up. Now hes trying to present an air of inevitability as the primary races winner. It wasnt all good feelings, though. At the auto plant, Biden was interrupted repeatedly by protesters angered by his support for the North American Free Trade Agreement and reluctance to embrace sweeping environmental proposals outlined in the Green New Deal.  	In a scuffle with demonstrators, Biden senior adviser Symone Sanders was knocked to the ground but unhurt.Biden also endured a testy exchange with a worker who accused him of actively trying to end our Second Amendment right. Biden responded, Youre full of shit, and went on to say that while he supports the Second Amendment, Do you need 100 rounds His gun control plan reinstates the assault weapons ban and includes a voluntary buyback program for assault weapons, stopping short of a mandatory buyback program that some of his opponents had supported in the primary. Although he has rejected notions he could drop out of the race if Tuesday goes badly, Sanders says he is now battling the Democratic establishment. In a general election, which candidate can generate the enthusiasm and the excitement and the voter turnout we need Sanders asked.Detroit neighbors Fayette Turner and Margaret Marsh were split on which to support Turner voted for Sanders on Tuesday, while Marsh voted for Biden. But they agreed on one thing the desire to beat Trump. Anybody but Trump, Turner, 64, said. Marsh, 69, said her family has identified as Republican her entire life -- until Trump took office.I think Bidens the sanest one left, Marsh said. Hopefully hell have a good vice president..

Oil price wars over the weekend, which came amid fears of a spreading coronavirus, sent U.S. stock prices into a tailspin Monday. But Topeka wealth management expert James Walden says a declining stock market isn't cause for concern just yet.


   


  Walden, chief investment officer for Clayton Wealth Partners, says that, on average, the U.S. stock market sees about a 20% decline once every three years. He stresses that the current decline is much different from the 2008 stock market crash.


   


  "We don't see any systemic issues like we did then," Walden said. "There's no real threat of our financial system collapsing like there was back then, so we do think that this period is different."


   


  The stock market dive Monday came after Saudi Arabia, a major exporter of oil, opted to lower prices and ramp up its production of oil to increase its market share.


   


  "Now why are markets reacting to this? Because here in the United States, we have a lot of marginal players in our domestic oil patch, and they need oil prices at a certain level to make money," Walden said.


   


  "Some of these marginal players also have high levels of debt," he added, "so these significant declines in oil prices can have a big impact on some of these companies but also the industries that are associated with them -- and also the economies of states like Texas and North Dakota, which rely heavily on oil."


   


  He suggested direct impact on the Kansas economy, which relies heavily on agriculture, could be limited.


   


  "We monitor the markets continuously, paying particular attention to the stock prices of existing Kansas companies and to several companies we are working to recruit into the state," said David Toland, secretary of the Kansas Department of Commerce. "Markets never move in one direction forever, and it's important to be circumspect about taking action based on the emotion of one day or one week."


   


  Walden agrees, and he encourages investors to think long term.


   


  "Don't panic and keep a long-term perspective," he said. "If investors are still relatively young and are a net saver, investors should welcome these periodic sell-offs because investors can then buy more shares of investments at a cheaper price."


   


  For those who may have a shorter time frame for investments, he added, Monday's market activity highlights the need to build a diversified portfolio.


   


  Still, Walden expects U.S., and global, gross domestic product to take a hit from the uncertainty surrounding the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19.


   


  "We think that there's two reasons why the market has been declining," Walden said. "The first one is due to the uncertain nature of events. Markets in general just abhor uncertainty. And the second reason is that there will very likely be an impact to the U.S. and global economies -- so it's two-fold."


   


  Tom Siomades, chief investment officer for AE Wealth Management, said market dips tend to come in waves.


   


  "Volatility in markets is sort of the price you pay for returns, and it's always been the case," Siomades said. "We've had prior pandemics and epidemics -- whether it was SARS or MERS or Ebola or Zika, you name it. ... Within a year of these types of things, (markets) always tend to bounce back."


   


  Walden said in the near term he hopes to see some sort of policy response from the Federal Reserve and other global central banks, "as well as any potential fiscal response coming from the administration and Congress." Investment managers, he added, are paying close attention to the growth rate of new confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States.


   


  Getting the stock market back on track, Walden added, may take some time.


   


  "It bounces along with fits and starts," he said. "This bottoming looks like it's going to be a process, and we anticipate volatility to continue."

Airlines are slashing flights and freezing hiring as they experience a sharp drop in bookings and a rise in cancellations in the face of the spreading coronavirus.


  Delta Air Lines said Tuesday that travel demand has fallen so badly in the past week that it expects one-third of seats to be empty this month on flights within the United States -- previously the market most immune to virus fallout.


  Business travelers are grounded as meetings and conferences are being canceled. Leisure travelers are scared.


  Normally airlines try to lure reluctant customers by discounting fares, but that won't work in the face of the COVID-19 outbreak.


  "If you are scared of flying, you are probably scared at any price," said Delta President Glen Hauenstein.


  Delta, the world's biggest airline by revenue, said it will cut international flights by 20% to 25% and reduce U.S. flying by 10% to 15%, roughly matching cuts previously announced by United Airlines. CEO Ed Bastian said the airline is "prepared to do more" if the outbreak grows.


  The airline is cutting spending, including putting a freeze on hiring, delaying voluntary pension contributions and suspending share buybacks.


  American Airlines announced it will cut international flying by 10% this summer and reduce U.S. flying by 7.5% in April. It has delayed training of new pilots and flight attendants.


  United said it has arranged $2 billion in additional bank borrowing to preserve financial flexibility -- raising liquidity from $6 billion to $8 billion.


  The airlines are also evaluating their assets -- planes, engines, spare parts and other items -- to determine what could be used as collateral for more borrowing, if that is needed.


  The demand drop-off that began in Asia picked up steam in the U.S. about two weeks ago, when the virus spread outside Asia, notably to Italy. It has been felt equally among business and leisure travelers.


  Hauenstein said demand has fallen more sharply on the West Coast -- Washington state and California have suffered larger outbreaks -- than on the East Coast. He said younger people have been more willing to keep flying; people over 55 less willing.


  The virus appears to be most dangerous among older people. The Associated Press reported this week that the White House overruled a plan by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend that older and physically weak Americans be advised not to fly on commercial airlines because of the new virus, according to a federal official.


  American's CEO, Doug Parker, said the largest decline has been in tickets within seven days of departure, which are often bought by business travelers.


  "That is absolutely driven by U.S. corporations putting in place travel advisories and travel restrictions and canceling travel," he said. "Once we get to the point where corporate America is ready to travel again, that will come back."


  Airlines have been waiving change fees and touting stepped-up cleaning of airplane cabins to make passengers feel more comfortable about flying.


  Delta, United, American and most international carriers have suspended flights to China, where the outbreak began and has infected the most people.


  U.S. airline officials have expressed steadfast confidence that they can manage their way through the outbreak.


  Airline stocks have been among the hardest hit during the market sell-off of the last few weeks.


  Since mid-February, shares of American have lost more than half their value, United's stock has fallen more than 40% and Delta and Southwest Airlines more than 25%. They rallied slightly in trading Tuesday morning.

Brent hit a session high of US$38.22 a barrel, and US crude hit US$34.60. Technical traders called this an "inside day" since neither benchmark touched the previous session's high or lows and said the day's bounce looked like prices were consolidating in a new range.                                    "The oil price went up today because it went insanely down yesterday, and some bargain hunters are driving things up," said Bjoernar Tonhaugen, head of oil markets at energy consultant Rystad, noting "It will go down further with some days going up in between."                                    Both benchmarks plunged on Monday to their lowest since February 2016, their biggest one-day percentage declines since Jan 17, 1991, at the outset of the first Gulf War.                                    Trading volumes in the front-month for both contracts on Tuesday were well below the record highs seen on Monday. Volumes soared on Monday after Saudi Arabia, Russia and other major oil producers ended three years of cooperation to limit supply and started a price war for market share.                                    Saudi, the world's biggest oil exporter, escalated tensions with plans to supply 12.3 million barrels per day (bpd) in April, well above current production levels of 9.7 million bpd, Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said on Tuesday.                                    "Oil prices have managed to hold on to some gains despite Saudi Arabia's announcement to open the floodgates in April," Rystad's Tonhaugen said, noting "Saudi Arabia is not bluffing and the market will feel it next month."                                    With oil erasing over a third of its value this week, OPEC members were bleeding over US$500 million a day in lost revenue, according to Reuters calculations.                                    Russian oil minister Alexander Novak said he did not rule out joint measures with OPEC to stabilize the market, adding that the next OPEC+ meeting was planned for May-June.                                    Saudi Arabia's energy minister told Reuters he did not see a need to hold an OPEC+ meeting in May-June if there was no agreement on measures to deal with the impact of the coronavirus on oil demand and prices.                                    "I fail to see the wisdom for holding meetings in May-June that would only demonstrate our failure in attending to what we should have done in a crisis like this and taking the necessary measures," Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said.                                    "Price wars and pandemics are nothing new to the commodity markets, but both occurring simultaneously is something we have yet to witness in our careers," RBC analysts said in a note.                                    Sentiment was also lifted after Chinese President Xi Jinping made his first visit to Wuhan since the coronavirus outbreak forced an unprecedented lockdown of the city of 11 million people, a sign that efforts to control the virus are working.                                    Crude prices drew some support from this, although analysts expect global oil demand will continue to slump during the outbreak, which has spread beyond China and prompted Italy to implement a nationwide lockdown.

Proprio per la sempre più dilagante scelta di preferire rapporti occasionali ad una relazione stabile soprattutto nelle grandi città come Torino, ha convogliato i giovani nella direzione del far cadere tutti i tabù pregressi derivanti dalla morale del passato instillata nelle loro menti dalle generazioni che li hanno preceduti. Un conto è praticare del sesso con una persona a cui sei legato e a cui cerchi di mostrare il lato migliore di te, il più pudico, il più pulito, un conto è prendere l’attività sessuale come un gioco da condurre con un compagno/a del momento, adescato a tale scopo, senza ulteriori implicazioni. Un atteggiamento di apertura questo, che poi si ripercuoterà anche nelle relazioni stabili, grazie al fatto che si sono rotti degli schemi, abbassate delle barriere.

Technical chart claims that Guess', Inc. (GES) would settle between $13.02/share to $13.63/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $12.08 mark, then the market for Guess', Inc. becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $11.75 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -1.89. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

The world has reached peak apocalypse mode over concerns related to the coronavirus. Whether perception or reality, it's a thing.


  And that thing has now threatened American sporting events. Italy is on lock- down and soccer matches are being played without live crowds. The paranoia has arrived here in the United States, too.


  While the NBA hasn't floated out the extreme measure of canceling games, it is being discussed behind closed doors. The league did roll out a new protocol for players and reporters to limit contact. Locker rooms are closed to the media and there must be a six-foot barrier during interviews. Get ready for the zombies.


  "I'm just following the lead of people that are in the know, I concede it is a different course for sure," Sixers coach Brett Brown told reporters, via PhillyVoice. "Personally, I am fascinated by the whole thing, but as it relates to our job and what we're able to do or not able to do, it hasn't reached a stage [where] I feel it's impeding our ability to prepare or coach or whatever yet."

In light of local COVID-19 cases, Rome City Schools suspended all attendance-based incentive programs for students.                    “We don’t want that to be a reason for someone to come to school sick,” Superintendent Lou Byars said.                     In the past, students have gotten to go ice-skating or have school dances for good behavior -- good attendance included. The decision does not mean the incentives are cancelled. It just means that attendance is no longer a requirement.                    However, Byars did tell the school board at their Tuesday caucus that other field trips haven’t been cancelled in light of the coronavirus just yet.                    The school system has received no notice from any government agency or local hospitals that anyone within the system has been exposed to the virus, Byars said after the Tuesday board meeting. However, the board wants to ensure that sick students stay at home.                    When asked if the system would notify the public if there was a positive case, Dawn Williams, the assistant superintendent, said they would follow guidelines offered by the Georgia Department of Public Health.                    “It is determined by the level of risk, and they give us guidelines that we need to take action on. We would notify them at that time,” Williams said.                    There is a plan to make sure that children are able to continue education in case RCS has to shut down for an extended period of time.                     Byars said in caucus that students can continue learning through Google Classroom if schools do close due to the coronavirus. He also said there are ways to make sure students who may not have access to the internet are able to get their work.                    The school system plans to feed children even if the schools get shut down, since some students depend on their schools for meals. Plans for a “Grab & Go” program are still being finalized.                    On Tuesday, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced flexibilities to allow meal services during unexpected school closures.                    “During an unexpected school closure, schools can leverage their participation in one of USDA’s summer meal programs to provide meals at no cost to students,” a press release states.                    Under normal circumstances, those meals must be served in a group setting. However, in a public health emergency, the law allows USDA the authority to waive the group setting meal requirement, which is vital during a social distancing situation, Perdue said.                    Also at the board meeting, Jason Self, who oversees security for the school system, unveiled broad plans to use a security grant from the state. Many local schools will receive additional cameras and fencing under the grant.

  Warrenton (16-11), which was led by sophomore Garneisha Love’s six points, was making its first sectional appearance since 2016, when the Warriors dropped a much-closer 53-46 decision to Incarnate.


  The Red Knights scored the first nine points of the contest and were off and running to a 16-2 lead at the end of one quarter and a 33-7 advantage at halftime.

In the case of South Sudan these problems were overcome. The United States massively supported the Southerners’ claim, based on the hope that a referendum and possible secession of the South would end the long and bloodthirsty war the country had suffered for decades. Public support, enhanced by the American film star George Clooney, also helped. In January 2011, the South held a referendum under the conditions of the 2005 _Comprehensive Peace Agreement_ (CPA) and overwhelmingly decided to secede; in July 2011 independence was declared. South Sudan joined the UN shortly thereafter and became the 193rd member state of the international community of states.

If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $0.15 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -0.06. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

Lawmakers reportedly sweated for months over the legislation, which extends key elements of the USA Freedom Act, the 2015 replacement for the NSA's " _StellarWind_ " program exposed by whistleblower Edward Snowden - even though the NSA itself no longer uses the program. Indeed, it was the Trump administration, not Congress, that pleaded for its reauthorization, on the offchance it might be needed again in the future.                                                    Judiciary Committee chair Jerrold Nadler (D-New York) insisted to reporters on Tuesday that the bill represents a " _significant overhaul_ " of the surveillance program, " _end[ing] the call details records program that began as a secret and unlawful surveillance project almost 20 years ago_." However, his boast only succeeded in highlighting Congress' abject failure to prosecute the " _rogue_ " intelligence agencies that crafted the original, wildly unconstitutional program all those years ago. Meanwhile, far from reining in the data-hungry intel agencies, the bill extends all three soon-to-expire provisions - roving wiretaps, " _lone wolf_ " surveillance, and access to metadata on request - without meaningful restrictions.                                                    The relative lack of fanfare surrounding the vote is unsurprising, given House Democrats' efforts to portray themselves as a meaningful #Resistance to a Trump administration they accuse of perpetrating rapacious attacks on the most vulnerable Americans. A similarly self-contradictory vote in November saw the Democrats vote unanimously to shoehorn a three-month reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act into a simple government-funding bill, ensuring the very same president they were seeking to impeach at the time would not be deprived of his sweeping surveillance powers.

JEFFERSON — The Ashe County Sheriff’s Office arrested two fugitives from Virginia and a man charged with harboring them on Feb. 28.                                    According to the ACSO, the office was notified Feb. 28 by multiple agencies of an alleged endangered baby situation. Ricky D. Finley, 33, of White Top, Va., and Kayla L. Widener, 30, of White Top, Va., were “considered fugitives from justice and were on the run with their less than four-month-old infant child,” the ACSO said in a press release.                                    The ACSO stated that the United States Marshal Service reached out at approximately 1 p.m. with information on Finley and Widener, with the search being widened to Ashe County after law enforcement in Virginia ran out of options.                                    The ACSO was led to the home of Timothy D. Hartzog Jr., 23, of Lansing, via a contact’s tip.                                    “Our initial attempt to request entrance to the home from Hartzog went unanswered. Our highest priority was ensuring the safety of the small infant,” the statement from the ACSO said. “This led to the officers attempting to locate the fugitives and the child inside this residence to surround the home and remain there for several hours awaiting a search warrant. The search warrant for the home was executed around midnight. The fugitives and baby were located in the home, the baby safe and unharmed. The situation resulted in the arrest of both fugitives as well as the homeowner for harboring them.”                                    Finley and Widener were arrested on fugitive warrants and were later extradited to Virginia. In Washington County, Finley is charged with possession of methamphetamine and three counts of distribution of a schedule I/II controlled substance and Widener is charged with selling methamphetamine.                                    The infant was returned to the custody of the Washington County Department of Social Services, according to the ACSO.                                    Hartzog was charged with harboring/aiding certain persons, and was released from the County Detention Center Feb. 29 under a $2,500 secured bond.

Our e-commerce business grew 11% sequentially to $7.9 million in the quarter and generated $27.5 million of net sales for the year, an 84% increase. The majority of these sales were from our US business, with a small, but growing contribution from international cross-border sales. We continue to build our business with fitness professionals and healthcare practitioners or HCPs, two influential and proactive groups. In December, we introduced our new TRU NIAGEN PRO 500 at the American Academy for Anti-Aging Medicine, one of the largest HCP trade shows of the year. This represents the largest serving of TRU NIAGEN available worldwide and it is exclusive to healthcare practitioners. We have a growing base of professional athletes and professional fitness trainers taking TRU NIAGEN today as well. Additionally, we are continuing to build our brand with strong global partnerships. First, we signed an agreement with a leading health and beauty retail chain to sell TRU NIAGEN in over 200 stores in the UK. This represents an initial test launch with the potential for broader distribution over time. We will support the launch with PR, social media and influencer campaigns to drive brand awareness and education, as well as optimize our existing Amazon UK product page. We began early market education in the second half of 2019 in London with scientific presentations at both The Health Optimization Summit and the Food Matters Summit. Additionally, we built upon our relationship with Matakana SuperFoods to include distribution rights in Australia. Matakana has done an excellent job in New Zealand and they will launch TRU NIAGEN in Australia this month. Australia has one of the highest per capita consumption of dietary supplements in the world. We are proud to be in business with Nestle Health Science and are excited for its plans to launch TRU NIAGEN this year. Marketing efforts will begin in mid-2020 with an online launch expected in the second half of the year. The initial test launch will be in loose powder format. While this will not have a material impact on our 2020 results, it is foundationally important. We and Nestle believe that cellular nutrition, we're addressing cellular processes within the cell that decline with age and under stress is a growing trend and we are very well positioned by partnering with Nestle to build awareness of TRU NIAGEN and NAD. Nestle had an exit clause in our agreement if technical feasibility or stability in liquid was not achieved by the end of 2019. This clause has expired. We continue to proactively work on liquid stability, although we are uncertain as to if or when this will be achieved. Last month, we expanded our partnership with Nestle by signing a three-year supply agreement with their recently acquired personalized nutrition service Persona Nutrition. Persona launched TRU NIAGEN into its customized vitamin and nutritional supplement delivery service and last month announced Kelly Ripa as its new spokesperson. Like its parent company Nestle, Persona shares our commitment to science and trusted high quality ingredients paired with peer-reviewed research.

The GOP has reshaped the federal judiciary in the last three years the constitutional way. Mr. Trump has nominated competent judges, and the Senate has confirmed most of his choices. No one should be surprised since Mr. Trump promised to do this during the 2016 campaign, relying on the advice of conservative legal advisers.                                    Democrats are still angry that Mitch McConnell denied a Senate hearing to Merrick Garland, President Obama’s nominee to replace Antonin Scalia, in 2016. That was political hardball. But no less than Mr. Schumer tipped in 2007 that he would have done the same had George W. Bush had a Supreme Court opening to fill in his final year as President.                                    “We should not confirm any Bush nominee to the Supreme Court, except in extraordinary circumstances,” Mr. Schumer declared in a July 2007 speech to the American Constitution Society. Mr. McConnell followed that Schumer precedent. He gambled the seat on the results of the 2016 election, when voters knew the future of the courts was on the ballot.                                    That future is again at stake, and Senate control arguably matters more to the judiciary than does the presidential race. Even if Mr. Trump is re-elected, a Senate Democratic majority would end the confirmation of judges who believe in constitutional originalism. Senate Democrats would refuse to confirm anyone associated with the Federalist Society or other conservative groups. And a Democratic President and Senate might not settle merely for nominating and confirming liberal judges.                                    The best indicator of Democratic intent is Sheldon Whitehouse, the Rhode Island Senator famous for excavating Brett Kavanaugh’s high-school yearbook. In January 2019, Mr. Whitehouse wrote to Chief Justice John Roberts to protest that the Court accepted friend-of-the-court briefs from “special interest groups that fail to disclose their donors.” He said if the Court didn’t cease and desist, “a legislative solution may be in order.” That’s a political threat.

BATON ROUGE- A lack of beds available when juveniles commit violent crimes is causing concern among one local sheriff and a local juvenile court judge.                                 Sheriff Brett Stassi sounded the alarm last week when a 14-year-old hit a 15-year-old with a bat, giving him a head injury that resulted in a concussion and the need for staples. That 14-year-old had been in trouble before, but there was no bed space anywhere around the state to house him.                                 Juvenile Court Judge Adam Haney in Baton Rouge is familiar with the problem. It's a problem that predominantly affects rural parishes and not East Baton Rouge.                                 "When you have situations where a youth should be detained pretrial, there is no place for them to go and other parishes are forced to look to those parishes that operate detention centers and go begging," Haney said.                                 But, all the begging didn't work for the 14-year old. Sheriff Stassi said a bed was not made available until almost one week after the incident. The child was sent home with an ankle monitor instead.                                 "In general, there is obviously an issue if there's a youth that has committed a new offense while on probation," Haney said. "That's a failure. The point of probation is to stay at home, allow you to rehabilitate without having to go into custody."                                The Office of Juvenile Justice tells WBRZ, there is no formal plan as of now to address the problem across the state. But, there have been meetings and discussions about it. Until something is done, juveniles who commit violent crimes in rural parishes will be at the mercy of available bed space, and if there isn't any they're set free.                                 "It affects other parishes, but affects us too," Haney said. "There are situations where it's incredibly frustrating to me that we'll have youth come in the parish and they show up at a detention center because they've been arrested and they have an ankle monitor put on for an offense they committed somewhere else."

So starting with the UK. We are taking the EU in general and UK specifically carefully. We are taking it one step at a time. We started by selling cross-border on Amazon into the UK. Then we supported that with some earned media and PR in the UK, and we received quite a few interesting articles about NIAGEN and ChromaDex there. And then we sought out and made a deal with a very good partner in the UK. And with that partner, we are doing this 200 store test launch. I don't expect it to be material in terms of the financial impact. But we are seeding the market and growing awareness in the UK, much like we did initially in the US. This is our strategy across the Board. We are also selling cross-border into Germany and Spain, and France. And we are talking to various partners in that region and also working to develop earned media press to build awareness of NIAGEN, of NAD, of cellular metabolism, and energy metabolism in those local countries.

It is not unusual for the UN to stay on after a self-determination claim and referendum. In Timor-Leste, which voted for secession from Indonesia in 1999 and became independent in 2002, the UN took over administration as the new state needed to be built from scratch following an outbreak of massive violence by pro-Indonesian militia and the Indonesian army (S/RES/1272). The mandate the UN Security Council gave to the UN Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) was broad, however, and ‘left several key questions unanswered, including the roadmap leading to self-government, the relationship of the governance and public administration component to the future East Timorese government, and the mechanism for consultation with the East Timorese’ (Martin and Mayer-Riek 2005, 133). Chesterman (2002, 63–4) argues that ‘many of the expatriates working for UNTAET and the 70-odd international NGOs tend to treat the Timorese political system as a _tabula rasa_ ’, an approach that effectively excluded the Timorese from their state-building project.

That's where the Vermont senator scored an upset that lent much-needed credibility to his 2016 primary challenge of Hillary Clinton \u2014 and where President Donald Trump's victory four years was so narrow that Democrats are desperate to show they have the strength to flip it back. The former vice president made a final push there in recent days, rallying autoworkers and touting a fresh round of high-profile endorsements.

On March 9, 2020, James Michael Hannah, who always had a song in his heart and on his lips until Alzheimer's stilled it, went home to heaven where he now sings and dances again.                    Jimmy was born in Baltimore, Md. on December 18, 1965 to Jim and Martha Hannah. His parents quickly rejected the advice to institutionalize Jimmy and instead took him home where love and companionship were a great place for any baby to thrive, but especially one with Downs Syndrome. Jimmy adored his three sisters and they him. His dad, "Big Jim" was his most cherished companion long into adulthood for outings as simple as riding in the truck or as special as an Alabama concert. His mom, Martha, had the right combination of firmness and love coupled with nursing skills to ensure a healthy, balanced childhood.                     Religion and love of God were very important to Jimmy. He loved serving as an altar boy, or, in "Jimmy-ese," the "Holy Boy." Family dinners sometimes grew cold as Jim's graces were long and enthusiastic. He spent as much time reading and copying from his Bible as he did building with blocks, coloring, studying his maps, and reading about the Three Stooges or the great love of his life, Mary Tyler Moore.                     Jimmy moved to West Virginia with his parents when they relocated to what his dad, a son of the Shenandoah Valley, called "the country." Before coming to live in the "Blue House", Jimmy lived at the Vineyard Home in Purgitsville. Together with other residents and dedicated volunteers and employees, Jimmy made apple butter, candy, and wine and tended animals. Later Jimmy was known affectionately to some at HCSSC or "Workshop" as "Hat Boy" as he loved wearing a fedora or cowboy hat just like "Big Jim." He will be remembered as one who reminded others it would "be okay" because there was always "Plan A or Plan B" and that in life things were "Easy come; easy go."

MONTGOMERY, Ala. (WSFA) - The Alabama House passed a bill Tuesday that would allow school boards to offer yoga classes in K-12 public schools.Rep. Jeremy Gray, D-Opelika, sponsored the bill that would allow yoga as an elective class in schools. Students are allowed to opt out of the class.“Being an athlete, yoga was introduced to me,” said Gray. “I also taught classes at the local gyms, so I understood the concept of yoga for its physical and mental benefits.”The bill said all poses should have English descriptive names. Chanting, mantras, and namaste greetings are prohibited.Gray said teachers in other classes would be allowed to incorporate yoga in their curriculum.“They call it mindfulness. Movement. You can do things like take deep breaths and count to 10. You can tell your neighbor that you love them," said Gray. "So there’s different aspects of yoga.”Several Republicans and Democrats stood in support of the bill on the House floor. In the past, opposition cited the religious roots of yoga as reasons not to allow it in schools. However, no lawmakers expressed that view on the House floor Tuesday.The bill passed 84-17 Tuesday in the House and now heads to the Senate for consideration.Copyright 2020 WSFA 12 News.

Because she reportedly was driving on a suspended license, officer Todd Wesbecher pulled over the Mayflower woman.


  Helton gave Wesbecher the OK to search her vehicle, the report states. While searching the white Jeep, the officer found a small baggie of suspected methamphetamine, as well as a larger bag of suspected methamphetamine that had approximately 8.3 ounces in it. According to an affidavit, the larger bag was found under the passenger seat and also “had a plastic cup inside, which was used as a ‘scoop.’”


  Helton and the passenger, Lisa Howard, were each arrested on drug trafficking charges and also face other drug-related charges. Online records show the two women appeared on March 4 via video conference before District Judge David L. Reynolds and were ordered to remain behind bars in the Faulkner County Detention Center in lieu of a $100,000 bond.


  Investigator Matthew Holland interviewed both women at the police department prior to having them booked into the county jail, according to an affidavit.


  During questioning, Helton admitted “to delivering methamphetamine” for “Hot- Shot.” According to her statement, she and her “associate,” Corey Shows, were approached by “Hot-Shot” about selling methamphetamine for him.


  After agreeing to sell meth for “Hot-Shot,” Helton said she followed the Wynne man to his motel room, where she saw “a large trash bag filled with marijuana, a large bag containing ecstasy (MDMA) and methamphetamine in the miniature refrigerator.”

Joe Biden was projected to cruise to easy wins in Democratic presidential contests in Missouri and Mississippi on Tuesday, striking an early blow against rival Bernie Sanders on a day when six states made their choices in the race to challenge U.S. President Donald Trump. Biden, the former vice president under Barack Obama and a heavy favorite over Sanders in both states, was projected to win the two states by Edison Research and television networks based on exit polls and early results.                    Polls closed in the two states, along with North Dakota. Biden was powered to the victories by strong support from a broad coalition of groups, including women, African Americans, those aged 45 and older, and all but the very liberal, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research.                    As in earlier states, Biden's support was especially strong among black voters. In Mississippi, where two-thirds of the electorate was African-American, Biden won more than eight of every 10 black voters. Biden, 77, was looking to take a big step toward the nomination to face the Republican Trump in the Nov. 3 election after becoming the front-runner with a series of sweeping wins over Sanders in last week's Super Tuesday contests.                    Sanders, a democratic socialist and U.S. senator from Vermont, hoped an upset win in Michigan on Tuesday would keep his dwindling White House hopes alive. Sanders, 78, won a stunning 2016 upset over Hillary Clinton in Michigan that ensured a long nominating fight - something Biden hopes to avoid this time. Washington and Idaho also held contests on Tuesday. There was no immediate projection for North Dakota, and polls close later in the three other states.                    As fears spread about the coronavirus, voters in Michigan, the biggest prize of the day, said they trusted Biden more than Sanders to handle a major crisis, according to exit polls. The polling in Michigan showed about half of voters trusted Biden in a crisis, compared to one-third who most trusted Sanders, Biden's last viable rival in the race.                    In Washington, the state hit hardest by coronavirus and the second-largest state to vote on Tuesday, eight in 10 voters voiced concern about the outbreak's effects, with a plurality supporting Biden, according to the Edison Research exit polls. Both candidates called off planned rallies in Cleveland, Ohio, on Tuesday due to concerns over the coronavirus outbreak, which has rattled markets and prompted Democrats to criticize the Trump administration's response.                    The campaigns said they were following guidance from Ohio public health officials. Until now, Democratic candidates as well as Trump, 73, have largely continued to hold large-scale events despite the outbreak. A total of 352 of the nearly 4,000 delegates to July's Democratic convention were up for grabs in the six states voting on Tuesday, with Michigan the biggest with 125 delegates.                    Since last week's Super Tuesday romps, Biden has roared into the national lead in polling and delegates, knocked out all remaining viable rivals except Sanders and swept up a wave of endorsements from former contenders such as Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker. A Biden breakthrough in Michigan, along with his big victories in Missouri and Mississippi, could prove too much for Sanders to overcome. By the end of March, about two-thirds of the delegates up for grabs will be allocated.

In that vein, it seems past time for Capitol Hill to give serious considerations to reasonable proposals to allow certain types of legislative work to be done remotely. For example, Reps. Eric Swalwell and Rick Crawford on Monday introduced a bipartisan House resolution that would change House rules to allow lawmakers to attend hearings by means of teleconference and cast certain types of uncontroversial votes remotely. Swalwell first introduced the resolution in 2013, but it has never gained traction. In fact, in 2014, Pelosi dismissed it and a similar idea—proxy voting—as a “slippery slope.” She may or may not be right that in the “regular order” such ideas are not a good idea. But situations of fast-spreading communicable disease may require something different than the regular order; it may be time to give such ideas a second, deeper look.It’s certainly time to stop striking stalwartly fearless leadership poses. Leadership in this situation involves getting used to conference calls and teleconferences—and being seen to do so, to enable others to follow suit.

Both Ethan and Danni were interesting choices for early Sele boots. They weren't voted out because their individual games were all that threatening and not because they weren't well-liked by their tribe mates. Quite the opposite, actually. They both had their feet in the door with many players on their tribe, but at the end of the day their association with the old school alliance and the tribe's fear of going directly after Parvati Shallow and Rob Mariano meant they had to be sacrificed. While neither has shown great promise at challenges so far, they are certainly the most threatening of the five boots in terms of social game. For that reason, both Ethan and Danni could find a path forward for themselves should they re-enter the game, especially if it comes shortly after the merge when the targets will be on the backs of the bigger physical threats.

Technical chart claims that Tecnoglass Inc. (TGLS) would settle between $5.29/share to $5.78/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $4.42 mark, then the market for Tecnoglass Inc. becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $4.04 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -0.87. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

ORLANDO, Fla. -- The 2020 census is off and running for much of America now.


   


  The U.S. Census Bureau made a soft launch of the 2020 census website on Monday, making its form available online. On Thursday, the Census Bureau will begin mailing out notices far and wide.


   


  For the bureau, the once-a-decade head count is akin to running a sprint and marathon at the same time. It takes awhile, but there's plenty of action throughout.


   


  "It is that intense …. counting up to 330 million people in a very diverse, very mobile population, and over 140 million housing units," Stephen Buckner, a senior Census Bureau executive, said during a recent visit to Miami.


   


  The bureau had an official in-person launch in January in Toksook Bay, Alaska. Mail service is spotty and internet connectivity is unreliable in remote Alaska, making door-to-door canvassing the best way to gather responses. The Alaska villages get a head start over the rest of the nation because many residents scatter each spring to subsistence hunting and fishing grounds.


   


  There has been a U.S. census every decade since 1790. The results determine how many congressional seats each state gets and how $1.5 trillion in federal spending is distributed.


   


  The 2020 census is the first in which most people are being encouraged to answer the questions online, though people can still answer the questionnaire by telephone or by mailing back a paper form if they prefer.


   


  The notices mailed out starting this week will include a census ID that matches addresses. People filling out the form via the internet are encouraged to use the ID, but those who answer the questions online before getting their IDs still will be counted.


   


  "The best user experience is provided with a Census ID," the bureau said in a statement Monday evening.


   


  About 80% of households receiving mailings will get notices about how to answer the questions online, and about 20% of households automatically will receive a paper ballot if there are large numbers of seniors in their neighborhood or levels of internet connectivity are low.


   


  Census workers won't begin going door-to-door in earnest until May, when they'll approach homes that haven't responded and ask the questions in person. Bureau officials are monitoring the spread of the novel coronavirus, which could disrupt the door-to-door phase. If there is a major disaster, such as an epidemic, census workers instead can drop off the questionnaires at homes, with the hope that people will respond on their own, according to the bureau's operational plan.


   


  Testifying before a U.S. Senate appropriations subcommittee on Tuesday, U.S. Secretary Wilbur Ross, whose department oversees the Census Bureau, said the emphasis on getting people to respond online is minimizing physical contact that could spread the virus.


   


  "We will just have to play it by ear," Ross said. "We are ready to make responses and we will deal with the situation as it evolves."


   


  This week also poses the first true test of the Census Bureau's new IT systems for capturing online responses. For the past three years, the Government Accountability Office has placed the census on its list of high- risk programs, mainly because it is relying on technology that has not been used before. Last month, the bureau decided to use a backup data-collection system for handling the online responses after officials grew concerned that the primary system would not be able to handle excessive traffic.


   


  The online approach to answering the 2020 census questions causes Democratic U.S. Rep. Karen Bass of California, to worry it will lead to an undercount of blacks and other minorities in hard-to-count communities.


   


  "Having the census online can be a way of continuously undercounting the black population," Bass said last week.


   


  Perhaps the most attention given the 2020 census over the past several years has been to the failed effort by the Trump administration to put a citizenship question on the form. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected those efforts, but some worry that lingering unease may scare off some Hispanics and immigrants from participating.


   


  "It's a challenge every 10 years to get any American to fill out the census. Some people feel you're invading their privacy, as though its intrusive. Some people are fearful of giving the government more information," said U.S. Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas. "But every 10 years, that challenge has been especially tough in minority communities, who sometimes are more disconnected from government than other communities."

But black voters like the ones who pushed Biden to big victories in South Carolina, and then in Virginia, Alabama and North Carolina, aren’t The Establishment, and it would be a mistake to characterize them as moderate, or even, as certain pundits maintain, somewhat conservative. Rather than placing these votes along a straight continuum between the left and the right, it would be better to think about black voters in their own particular contexts.

Cardinal George Pell's last-chance appeal against his child sex abuse convictions opened in Australia's top court Wednesday, with his fate now in the hands of the country's most senior judges.


  The 78-year-old, who is serving a six-year sentence for sexually assaulting two choirboys in the 1990s, was not present for the two-day High Court hearing in Canberra, where his lawyers will mount a final bid to clear his name.


  But supporters gathered outside the High Court building, waving Australian flags and carrying signs that read "Cardinal Pell is innocent forever" and "keep the faith Cardinal Pell".


  In December 2018, a jury found the former Vatican treasurer, who once helped elect popes, guilty on five counts of abusing the 13-year-old choirboys at a Melbourne cathedral when he was archbishop of the city.


  Pell is the highest-ranking Catholic Church official ever convicted of child sex crimes.


  He was sentenced in March 2019 and lost a first appeal in August, a decision that saw a three-judge panel split in a 2-1 verdict.


  The case pitted the cleric against a former choirboy victim now in his 30s, whom two of the judges found to be "very compelling" and someone who "was clearly not a liar, was not a fantasist and was a witness of truth".


  The third judge, however, found the man's account "contained discrepancies" and there was a "significant possibility" Pell did not commit the offences.


  In court submissions, Pell's legal team argued the majority judges applied an "erroneous judicial method" that required the cleric "to establish actual innocence as opposed to merely pointing to doubt".


  They also argue there was insufficient time for Pell to have molested the boys, that the cathedral was a "hive of activity" so others would have noticed, and that it was physically impossible for him to have pulled apart his cumbersome robes to commit the assaults.


  In response, the prosecution called the grounds for appeal "problematic", saying the argument "glosses over evidence" that supports the victim's account.


  The case relied solely on the testimony of Pell's surviving victim, as the other -- who is not known ever to have spoken of the abuse -- died of a drug overdose in 2014. Neither man can be identified for legal reasons.


  University of Melbourne law professor Jeremy Gans said it was difficult to predict the outcome of the closely watched appeal, being heard by a full bench of seven justices.


  The judges could quash the appeal immediately, or wait several months to hand down their ruling.


  Gans said the high court could also decide that the appeal court judges erred by viewing video evidence from the original trial and send the case back to them.


  "The only big development is they've said they're interested in whether the Court of Appeal did the right thing watching video," he told AFP.


  "That wasn't on the table but the High Court has now potentially put it on the table," he said.


  If that did occur, it would drag out an already lengthy process even further -- an outcome the father of the dead victim is eager to avoid.


  "This process continues to take a toll on his physical and mental health," his lawyer Lisa Flynn said Tuesday.


  "If the High Court allows George Pell to walk free from jail, our client says he will lose all faith in our legal system," she added.

Joe Biden took an early lead over rival Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential contest in Michigan on Tuesday and was projected to capture Missouri and Mississippi as six states made their choices in the race to challenge U.S. President Donald Trump. The race in Michigan was too close to call as the last polls closed in the state, television networks and Edison Research said, but Biden led Sanders by 53% to 42% with 26% of precincts reporting in the state, the day's biggest prize.                    Biden, the former vice president under Barack Obama, had been a heavy favorite over Sanders in Mississippi and Missouri and was projected to win easily based on exit polls and early results. Polls also closed in North Dakota with no early results. The polls close later in Washington and Idaho.                    Biden, 77, was looking to take a big step toward the nomination to face the Republican Trump in the Nov. 3 election after becoming the front-runner with a series of sweeping wins over Sanders in last week's Super Tuesday contests. Sanders, a democratic socialist and U.S. senator from Vermont, hoped an upset win in Michigan would keep his dwindling White House hopes alive. Sanders, 78, won a stunning upset over Hillary Clinton in Michigan in 2016 that ensured a long nominating fight - something Biden hopes to avoid this time.                    A total of 352 of the nearly 4,000 delegates to July's Democratic convention were up for grabs in the six states voting on Tuesday, with Michigan the biggest with 125 delegates. A Biden breakthrough in Michigan, along with his big victories in Missouri and Mississippi, could prove too much for Sanders to overcome. By the end of March, about two-thirds of the delegates will be allocated.                    Biden was powered to the early victories on Tuesday by strong support from a broad coalition of groups, including women, African Americans, those aged 45 and older, and all but the very liberal, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research. As in earlier states, Biden's support was especially strong among black voters. In Mississippi, where two-thirds of the electorate was African-American, Biden won more than eight of every 10 black voters.                    Washington and Idaho also held contests on Tuesday. There was no immediate projection for North Dakota, and polls close later in the three other states. As fears spread about the coronavirus, voters in Michigan said they trusted Biden more than Sanders to handle a major crisis, according to exit polls.                    The polling in Michigan showed about half of voters more trusted Biden in a crisis, compared to one-third who more trusted Sanders, Biden's last viable rival in the race. In Washington, the state hit hardest by coronavirus and the second-largest state to vote on Tuesday, eight in 10 voters voiced concern about the outbreak's effects, with a plurality supporting Biden, according to the Edison Research exit polls.                    Both candidates called off planned rallies in Cleveland, Ohio, on Tuesday due to concerns over the coronavirus outbreak, which has rattled markets and prompted Democrats to criticize the Trump administration's response. The campaigns said they were following guidance from Ohio public health officials. Until now, Democratic candidates as well as Trump, 73, have largely continued to hold large-scale events despite the outbreak.                    Since last week's Super Tuesday romps, Biden has roared into the national lead in polling and delegates, knocked out all remaining viable rivals except Sanders and swept up a wave of endorsements from former contenders such as Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker. Biden, who has touted the Obama administration's decision to bail out the auto industry, made a morning campaign stop at Detroit's first new auto assembly plant in decades, owned by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.                    "Unions built the country," Biden shouted through a bullhorn. "You're the best damn workers in the world." But his visit was marred by a clash with one worker who suggested he planned to confiscate Americans' guns. Biden, whose propensity to veer off script occasionally causes self-inflicted wounds, snapped at the worker using an obscenity.                    Sanders has attacked Biden for supporting international trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement, which is unpopular among many of Michigan's workers who say it has cost the state jobs. As Biden left the plant, video showed some workers chanting, "Trump!"

The warning came as Newsom announced an update to the painstaking process of disembarking more than 2,000 passengers from a cruise ship struck by the coronavirus and moving them to military bases around the U.S. for a two-week quarantine. The Grand Princess docked in the Port of Oakland Monday after being forced to idle for days off the coast while authorities scrambled to find a suitable port and plan to move the passengers into safe quarantine sites. While at sea, tests on people who showed symptoms of illness confirmed 21 contracted the coronavirus.

With the costs of solar and wind power plummeting, and with massive technological advances in batteries, electric vehicles, and other technologies to shift from fossil fuels, the pace of decarbonisation will continue to advance, and the shrinkage of the fossil-fuel industry will accelerate. Lobbyists will do their best to slow this decline, but they will not reverse it; the climate crisis is too grave to ignore. It’s long past time for our universities, pension funds, and indeed asset managers and bankers generally to recognize that the students are spot on. The fossil-fuel industry is on the way out, and divestment meets both the ethical and the practical investment test. Indeed, in our dire climate emergency, ethics and good investment practice are the same.

By fabricating ancient origins for racism, Vegter is trying to let liberalism off the hook for its historical crimes against African people and indigenous people in the Americas. The historical reality is not just that African slavery, and the invention of racism, happened at the same time as the birth of liberalism. As the Italian historian Domenico Losurdo shows, “the rise of liberalism and the spread of racial chattel slavery are the product of a twin birth”. Losurdo is a highly respected historian, published in English by Verso Books, arguably the leading serious press in the English-speaking world today. The _Financial Times_ described his book _Liberalism: A counter-history_ as “a brilliant exercise in unmasking liberal pretensions, surveying over three centuries with magisterial command of the sources”.

However, if the stock price goes below the $0.51 mark, then the market for Innovate Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $0.48 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -0.03. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

Yeah, maybe I'll take the last one first, since that's pretty straightforward I think. I mean, yes, we need to review the kind of the overall design and assumptions that we're making for the Phase 3 trial before we start.

But as I mentioned, we've been parallel processing the start up of that study and are well under way to get that Phase 3 up and running in that Q3 timeframe.

Just about 15 years ago, most everyone knew the Dixon Schwabl Marketing and Advertising Agency as the perennial pick on those great-places-to-work lists and at times as a fun place to work -- who doesn't know about the slide in the middle of the Perinton office and the ice cream Thursdays?                                    Business-wise, the firm was not only one of the more successful marketing and advertising firms but also was one of the more successful businesses in the area, period.                                    So who's thinking about retirement and finding replacement leaders at that point in time?                                    CEO Lauren Dixon, who founded the company in 1987, and company President Mike Schwabl -- that's who.                                    Even today, the Canandaigua wife and husband are still going strong as they begin easing out of the day-to-day operations of their business by the end of 2020.                                    But back in 2006, they had begun the process of creating a succession plan -- determining who would run the company when they decided to pass along the baton.                                    "Mike and I were like, 'What? Why 15 years?'" Dixon recounted recently. "It seems like an awfully long time."                                    But they were sold after hearing the story about a company that failed miserably because its owner waited too long and tried to transition the business the year he was retiring.                                    So Dixon and Schwabl would begin work on a succession plan, which included writing down the characteristics, morals and values they wanted to see in the people who would succeed them.                                    They realized early on that if they wanted to see a company that resembled the one they and their team had built, they couldn't sell to an outside private equity firm -- but they had to spell out what they wanted to see and plan for it, Schwabl said.                                    "I don't think I could have gotten over the guilt of feeling like we abandoned the people who helped us get to where we are today," Schwabl said. "They built this place alongside us and they should benefit from it."                                    Hopefully, he added, having this success plan in place accomplishes that desire.                                    According to Kristina Stamatis, a partner at Mengel Metzger Barr -- the Rochester firm with a Canandaigua office handling the succession planning for Dixon Schwabl -- identifying the need to begin a plan several years out and putting ideas to paper is only the first step.                                    "We like to do this fairly early, before you walk out the door," Stamatis said. "It's a gradual process but pro-active."                                    Also on the agenda: Gather a team of trusted advisers and determine what the business is worth. Tax consequences also must be considered as you address the company's next steps.                                    Determine who will take over and then how to begin transfer of ownership and for how long.                                    "There are so many different approaches to take," Stamatis said. "There are a lot of moving parts."                                    And when the transition begins to happen, let clients know what is happening and know you support the changes. Be a guide, but know when to step back and support the transition, Stamatis said.                                    In 2015, Dixon and Schwabl shared the news with longtime employees Kim Allen, who is managing partner of communications, and Jessica Savage, managing partner of accounting services, that they were chosen to succeed them as CEO and president, respectively. A year later, the news was shared with employees.                                    "We both thought in our heart of hearts that they were ready," Dixon said. "We couldn't have left if we didn't think they were so ready. I'm excited to see what they're going to do and how they're going to do it. I'm confident they're going to take this company to a whole new level than we ever thought possible."                                    Dixon and Schwabl felt that because family members also are involved in the business, there are a lot of balls to balance. So it's not just finding successors, but also the next level of successors and ensuring they, too, are the right fit, Schwabl said.                                    And that will be the job of Allen and Savage, to mentor them and bring them along.                                    "They're up to the challenge," Dixon said.                                    Having that plan in place also makes the fact that they're going to be leaving the day-to-day operations a bit less scary, Dixon said.                                    The two will still own the company but serve as co-chairpersons of the board. Both plan to still work on community and special projects.                                    "It's not like at the end of 2020 we're going to hit the dusty trail," Dixon said. "We'll be here. We're just going to work in a different way."                                    For instance, last year they started an office in Buffalo, where Schwabl is from, and they want to build on that.                                    Dixon also is interested in taking the culture-building, team-building program, Companies Are People, Too, to the national level. Schwabl, in addition to saying he wants to learn how to play hockey, plans to continue working on documentary films, mentioning a recent video produced for St. Mary's School in Canandaigua.                                    "We made a career of telling people's stories," Schwabl said. "I still see myself doing that in retirement."                                    Because this has been in the works for so long, Dixon said she and Schwabl are ready and the employees are ready. And, she said, she believes everyone is excited for a new adventure.                                    Excitement, instead of trepidation, is another benefit of preparation for the future.                                    "You want your business to continue," Stamatis said. "You want your legacy to continue."
