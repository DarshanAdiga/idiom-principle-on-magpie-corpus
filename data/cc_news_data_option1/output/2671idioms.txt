A day late and a dollar short. That just about describes my life to a T. Well, I am an overachiever and usually I am more than a day late and far more than a dollar short, but it gets the point across.
 In any case, I sat down to put pen to paper for this column and realized that the Fourth of July column I was about to write would be a bit late, but I also feel like the message is one that we all need in these turbulent times. No, I am not going to touch even remotely any of the current hot topics, but I do want to remind us, myself included, just how good we have it.
 The times we live in and the problems we are facing are difficult, to say the least, and some might say they are unprecedented. It is easy to get caught up in all of that and forget about the good things we are all blessed with.

 But, it seems, some evaded duties worth crores of rupee by classifying their products under a lower-taxed tariff heading.
 The Central Economic Intelligence Bureau (CEIB), which comes under the Department of Revenue, in a recent communication to the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) has said some manufacturers of alcohol-based sanitisers are resorting to "non-payment" or "evasion" of Central GST and State GST by adopting wrong classification. They were paying 12 per cent GST instead of the 18 per cent, it said.
 Following the CEIB letter, the DGGI prepared a list of 62 manufacturers and suppliers of sanitisers for analysis.
 The DGGI has asked the CGST and the Customs Excise zones officials to look into the cases of evasion by sugar mills and distilleries and plug the leakages. The DGGI zonal units are looking into the instances of evasion by established brands.

 What he saw in Arkansas was another crime thriller that is a comment on the inequities of the American Dream and a debunking of the cinematic fiction of honourable thieves.
 Organised crime in the South is not; it’s simply, “a loose affiliation of deadbeats and scumbags.”
 Hemsworth is a low level dealer who gets an an accidental promotion and has to work with Duke under Malkovich, whose overacting ought to have been criminal enough to attract unwanted police attention. They are part of a crime syndicate headed up by the mysterious Frog, an individual nobody knows the identity of.

“This discussion stemmed from a football journalist quoting from a ‘letter’ which the League has sent to clubs, and particularly highlighted the line ‘we’re all seriously hoping we will be able to get back to competitive football in October’.
 “We thought it might be useful, before this story takes on a life of its own, to clarify exactly what we know about the longed for return of our non-league game.
 “The ‘letter’ is in fact just one of the regular Newsletters sent to all clubs by our chairman Nick Robinson and covers a wide range of issues.
 “He and we very much hope that we will be back on the pitch this year, and there is some reason for optimism that we will return sooner rather than later, but there are many factors which will govern that and they are all outside our control.
 “The key word in the sentence quoted is “hoping” – for all of Nick’s discussions with the FA, and there have been many, we really don’t have any certainty yet. What we do know is that the League programme will not start behind closed doors.
 “Decisions on the return of our game will be made by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.
 “We’ve been led to believe that they’ll make them soon, but we are entirely at their mercy. The FA will then take the information provided by Government and present it to the League in a format which will be workable for us and our member clubs, and at that point we will share it with everyone involved so that we can all get on with planning our comeback.”

(AP) - A two-year audit of Facebook’s civil rights record found “serious setbacks” that have marred the social network’s progress on matters such as hate speech, misinformation and bias.Facebook hired the audit’s leader, former American Civil Liberties Union executive Laura Murphy, in May 2018 to assess its performance on vital social issues. Its 100-page report released Wednesday outlines a “seesaw of progress and setbacks” at the company on everything from bias in Facebook’s algorithms to its content moderation, advertising practices and treatment of voter suppression.The audit recommends that Facebook build a “civil rights infrastructure” into every aspect of the company, as well as a “stronger interpretation” of existing voter suppression policies and more concrete action on algorithmic bias. Those suggestions are not binding, and there is no formal system in place to hold Facebook accountable for any of the audit’s findings.“While the audit process has been meaningful, and has led to some significant improvements in the platform, we have also watched the company make painful decisions over the last nine months with real world consequences that are serious setbacks for civil rights,” the audit report states.Those include Facebook's decision to exempt politicians from fact-checking, even when President Donald Trump posted false information about voting by mail. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has cited a commitment to free speech as a reason for allowing such posts to remain on the platform, even though the company has rules in place against voter suppression it could have used to take down — or at least add warning labels to — Trump's posts.Last month, Facebook announced it would begin&nbsp;labeling rule-breaking posts&nbsp;— even from politicians — going forward. But it is not clear if Trump's previous controversial posts would have gotten the alert. The problem, critics have long said, is not so much about Facebook's rules as how it enforces them.“When you elevate free expression as your highest value, other values take a back seat,” Murphy told The Associated Press. The politician exemption, she said, “elevates the speech of people who are already powerful and disadvantages people who are not.”More than 900 companies have joined an advertising boycott of Facebook to protest its handling of hate speech and misinformation.Civil rights leaders who met virtually with Zuckerberg and other Facebook leaders Tuesday expressed skepticism that recommendations from the audit would ever be implemented, noting that past suggestions in previous reports had gone overlooked.“What we get is recommendations that they end up not implementing,” said Rashad Robinson, the executive director of Color for Change, one of several civil rights nonprofits leading an organized boycott of Facebook advertising.Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, said in a Facebook newsroom post that the company has a long way to go, but is making progress.“This audit has been a deep analysis of how we can strengthen and advance civil rights at every level of our company — but it is the beginning of the journey, not the end,” she wrote. “What has become increasingly clear is that we have a long way to go.

It turns out, however, if your last name is Gabel, sugarbeets are in your blood. In 1976, instinct took over and Leroy and Sydney leased 40 acres of farmland from Leroy’s father, exchanging their labor for the use of his machinery. The couple kept their nose to the grindstone and were eventually able to purchase their own equipment.
 Looking back over his 48-year tenure as a sugarbeet farmer, Leroy notes mechanization has had a huge impact on the industry. Leroy’s forefathers in Russia would have harvested the root crop by hand using a beet knife. His great-grandfather and grandfather would have seen the first wave of technology as horse-drawn equipment lessened some of the work. Single-row diggers made harvesting easier for Leroy’s father and Leroy is thankful for the six-row digger he has gotten to use.
 Leroy and Sydney both believe in advocating for their industry. Leroy has served on several boards over the years and currently sits on the Yellowstone County Soil Conservation District Board. The couple have been huge supporters of 4-H and FFA throughout the years, as well.
 They have experienced agriculture hardships, just like the generations before them have, as well. Raising sugarbeets isn’t always such a sweet deal, but still, the Gabels continue to persevere.
 “There is opportunity, even in the bad times. Hard work will always prevail,” Leroy says.
 Those words rang true when the Gabels left the old Country and they still ring true today, especially during these unprecedented times.

The BBC investigations revealed that Senegal's forests are being plundered at an alarming rate to support this trade.
 In Senegal it is illegal to fell or export a rosewood tree and yet we saw evidence of this happening in broad daylight.
 "It's The Gambia that has to stop the export of rosewood. They make good speeches, good promises, they say: 'We are going to stop', but in reality it is not true," said Haidar el Ali, a former Senegalese minister of environment, told the BBC.
 The Gambia's current government has also banned the export of pterocarpus erinaceus.
 Under the country's Forestry Act of 2018, importation from another country is only legal if it goes through an official port of entry. But all the depots we discovered have been active since Mr Barrow's government has been in power.
 The BBC also obtained footage showing truckloads of rosewood logs driving towards The Gambian capital Banjul earlier this year.
 The government, however, denied the allegations contained in the BBC Africa Eye investigation.
