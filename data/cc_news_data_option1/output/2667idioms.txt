Because our mentalities are so configured and devoted towards the warped, we see things and people that haunt and horrify, where the truth of the matter is that there are none. For even the esteemed jurists of the CCJ have come under fire; they are leaned on, in a most unbecoming manner, to go the coalition’s way. But because our political leaders, their supporters, and most other citizens are so unswervingly suspicious, even now there is some sentiment that underhanded conspiracy is in the works, and that it will result in electoral injustice.

US Deputy Secretary of State and North Korea envoy Stephen Biegun on Wednesday poured cold water on reports Washington had sought a meeting with Pyongyang officials, with nuclear discussions at a standstill.
 Biegun is on a four-day trip to Seoul and Tokyo to discuss North Korea's denuclearisation.
 The visit triggered speculation in the South that Washington was trying to rekindle diplomacy with Pyongyang ahead of the US presidential election in November -- even though the North has repeatedly said it had no interest in talks.
 "I've seen some press comments that the North Koreans are not prepared to meet with me on this visit," Biegun told reporters after talks with his South Korean counterpart.
 "It's somewhat strange because we did not request a visit with North Koreans," he said, adding: "Let me absolutely be clear, we did not request a visit."
 Talks over Pyongyang's nuclear arsenal have been stalled since a Hanoi summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un collapsed in early 2019 over what the North would be willing to give up in exchange for sanctions relief.
 Kim declared in December an end to moratoriums on nuclear and ballistic missile tests, and Pyongyang has repeatedly said it has no intention to continue talks unless Washington drops what it describes as "hostile" policies toward the North.
 Biegun also suggested last month that another meeting between Trump and Kim was unlikely, although he held out hope for progress in nuclear negotiations.
 The US envoy said Wednesday that the North Koreans "will find us ready" at any time to return to talks.
 Rumours surrounding the possibility of another summit swirled last week after former US national security advisor John Bolton reportedly said Trump might pursue another meeting with Kim in October if it would help his re-election chances.
 But hours before Biegun arrived in Seoul on Tuesday, the North again ruled out the possibility of resuming talks, saying Pyongyang had "no intention to sit face to face with the United States".
 The North's state media reported that leader Kim paid respects to his grandfather and predecessor Kim Il Sung at his Kumsusan Palace of the Sun mausoleum on Wednesday, the 26th anniversary of his death.

Charity Adams, executive director of the Cairo Community Foundation, described the cruise night as “an awareness evening.” It was designed “just to bring people out, bring people together and celebrate Go Big Give.”
 The Vault walk-up window and the Cairo Bowl and Watering Hole were open for refreshments. People who presented a receipt showing that they donated $20 or more to Cairo nonprofits received a free lemonade from the Vault and a food deal from the Cairo Bowl and Watering Hole.
 During the day, three Cairo nonprofits were positioned outside the Vault.
 “We’re just delighted today,” Adams said. “We have seen some remarkable gifts come in. We really are proud of the fact that people are supporting our community with those gifts.”
 In addition to the Cairo Community Foundation, the nonprofits near the Vault were the All Belong to Christ Daycare and Preschool and New Hope Christian School. The Centura Educational Foundation was positioned at the corner of Highways 2 and 11.
 The Cairo Community Foundation provides support. “But it’s truly the people in the community that do the work,” Adams said. “We have lots of volunteers that are leading some very big projects.”
 Those projects include the community’s veterans memorial, youth summer camps and new bathrooms and possibly showers at the north ballfield. In addition, the tennis courts will be turned into pickleball courts.
 The Centura Educational Foundation was raising funds for the renovation of the preschool and community facilities project at Centura School.
 The All Belong to Christ Daycare and Preschool served a homemade lasagna dinner from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.
 The New Hope Christian School, which is beyond capacity, is planning a new building. “We’re just outgrowing our school, which is a good problem to have,” said Jenny Reynolds, a New Hope mom and volunteer.
 The K-8 school is currently in two buildings. In addition to its main school, Apfel Funeral Home provides space to New Hope Christian.
 The $350,000 project will include three new classrooms and a multipurpose room. Before Go Big Give, supporters had raised $247,000. New Hope doesn’t want to go into debt to build the school.
 The use of the Apfel Funeral Home space “has been wonderful,” Reynolds said. But school supporters would like “to have our kids in one building,” give them a place to “get away from their desks to eat lunch” and a place to play when it’s cold outside.

AUD/USD stays depressed after taking a U-turn from monthly top of 0.6998. A return to lockdown in Melbourne, over three million cases in the US portray the coronavirus resurgence. RBA's economic worries join US dollar recovery to snap the aussie pair's six-day winning streak. No major data at home or from China highlights virus headlines, risk catalysts as the key. AUD/USD kick-starts Wednesday's trading session by struggling to extend the latest recovery moves from 0.6938 while taking rounds to 0.6950. The quote snapped a multi-day run-up the previous day while reversing from 0.6998. However, its following recovery moves from 0.6921 failed to last longer than 0.6979. The coronavirus (COVID-19) resurgence in top-tier global economies, including Australia, recalls the fear trades and dragged the risk barometer the previous day. Also portraying the sentiment was the US dollar index (DXY) which bounced off a two-week low amid upbeat data and safe-haven demand. Furthermore, RBA's grim economic outlook added weakness into the AUD/USD pair on Tuesday. Pandemic plays it hard… Be it a six-week lockdown in Melbourne and surrounding cities or record-breaking virus figures from the US, crossing three million mark, global economies have recently been hit by the pandemic's resurgence. Additionally, Tokyo marked over 100 cases for the fifth day in a row whereas situations in India are also worrisome. On the contrary, Beijing registered zero cases while also announcing a third trial of the vaccine in Brazil. However, the US health official Dr. Fauci has poured cold water on the face of expectations that any cure can stop the pandemic. Elsewhere, the US- China tussle remains on the table with the recent announcement from US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stating visa restrictions for some Chinese officials over Tibet. Furthermore, the dragon nation keeps its hard stand against American and the UK when it comes to opposing the ban on Huawei and fighting against the Hong Kong security law. Amid all these plays, Wall Street bulls catch a breather after the previous day's stellar performance while the US 10-year Treasury yields also revisited sub-0.65% area, down 4.4 basis points (bps). It should also be noted that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) announced no change to its record low interest rate of 0.25% and earlier announced Quantitative Easing (QE) during the July month's monetary policy meeting. However, the central bank cited economic fears, due to the deadly disease, while also showing readiness to keep the policies easy for the time being. On the other hand, upbeat US JOLTS Job Openings, 5.397M versus 4.85M expected, offered additional support to the greenback. Looking forward, a light economic calendar highlights the virus headlines and Sino-American news as the key catalysts. Technical analysis Tuesday's bearish spinning top signals the traders' indecision but the pair's sustained trading above key SMAs, the 21-day SMA level around 0.6900 being the nearest support, keeps buyers hopeful. Though, 0.7000 threshold becomes important to watch for fresh long positions.

Kristina Vlcek, a Chapman community member and business owner, said it would be good to use the gym and cafeteria portion of the school building as a community center. She said the remaining portion of the building is “the harder side of things” and questioned if the two sides could be partitioned off.
 “I think it would be really cool to just let the community be able to use the gym, possibly having a little weight room and things like that,” Kristina Vlcek said.
 “Then, we can continue to have the community Thanksgiving and all those things we used to have in the past.”
 Chapman resident Francis McCulla, who serves as the custodian at Chapman School, said weddings and receptions could be held at the building if the village board chooses to buy it. He said since the Chapman School building is no longer operating as a school, alcohol would be allowed at these events.
 “We could even have a band up on the stage and rent it out for that,” McCulla said.
 “I also know Grand Island Central Catholic is constantly having their gym rented out by traveling teams. We will have nets and basketball hoops. You could rent the gym out to a traveling team.”
 Killin said that if the village were to rent out the gym and/or cafeteria space, it would need to look at it as a business that would be profitable to the village as there would be costs to heat and cool the building.
 The village board is expected to continue discussions on the Chapman School building at its upcoming meetings.

It was the second year in a row that Go Big Give set a $1 million goal.
 At 10:56 p.m., Go Big Give had raised $970,042 for 137 nonprofit organizations in Hall, Hamilton, Howard and Merrick counties.
 During the evening, Benson, Wanitschke and other individuals were stationed at Go Big Give headquarters in the Harmony Building downtown.
 With a few hours to go, Benson said that COVID-19 possibly played a role in donations because people are “being furloughed or having to put money towards other things.”
 But at the same time, she said, a lot of nonprofit organizations aren’t able to raise funds and do other activities.
 Go Big Give “is a really good way for people to still give to them and hopefully keep their doors open for the year to still do great work,” said Benson, who is director of community engagement for Heartland United Way.
 This year’s Go Big Give was moved from May 2 to Tuesday because of the pandemic.
 The annual event is organized by the Greater Grand Island Community Foundation and Heartland United Way.
 Some of the Go Big Give activities moved online this year.

CYPREMORT POINT — An Abbeville fisherwoman didn’t quit, a Jeanerette angler kept a good thing going and a Denver offshore fisherman and skipper did the best he could 145 miles from here in the Gulf of Mexico on a trying holiday weekend for all who fished the 67th annual Iberia Rod & Gun Club Saltwater Fishing Rodeo.
 One good, sunny, sultry hot summer day on Saturday, the Fourth of July, was sandwiched by rotten, stormy weather on the first day Friday and again on the third and final day Sunday. The weather conditions, plus in all likelihood fallout from coronavirus pandemic restrictions and concerns, combined to make it a challenging experience for fishing rodeo officials and fishing rodeo participants.
 About three dozen smaller boats and half-a-dozen or so big boats answered the challenge, even if it meant fishing one or two days of the three-day event at Cypremort Point.
 Angelic Broussard of Abbeville persevered and fished all three days on her way to claiming the Inside Division’s Best All-Around Fisher(wo)man title while fishing with her husband, Michael Robideaux. Broussard stuck at least one fish on the leaderboard each day.
 Brock Pellerin of Jeanerette, past fishing rodeo chairman with a little more time on his hands, guided the Donna Sue, a 21-foot Gravois hull owned by Jimmy Gravois and named after his wife, to the Boat Captain’s Award in the Inside Division. The boat led wire-to-wire and was led by his wife, Stephanie, who finished with two fish on the leaderboard when the scales closed at 1 p.m. on a soggy Sunday.
 Ryan Dearman of Denver, formerly of Lafayette, left Thursday night in the Aorta B Fishin in an effort to defend his 2019 Boat Captain’s Award in the Offshore Division. Dearman and his six-man crew went far south and east to the Constitution, Kerr McGee’s floating oil rig in Green Canyon, and to a Helix Energy Solutions structure in that area of the Gulf.
 Storms drove the big boat in Friday evening and the skipper and crew weighed on the Fourth of July. For the second year in a row, Dearman’s boat boasted the Offshore Division Best All-Around Fisherman, Michael Duhon of Lafayette. Duhon’s cousin, Jordan Duhon of Lafayette, won that title in 2019.
 It apparently was about as normal a major fishing rodeo as could be. A free supper of red beans, sausage and rice paid for by Gerrit “T-Blu” Landry’s Gotta Have Faith Charters and cooked by Gerard Olivier with the help of Clint Derouen, was served as scheduled Saturday. Another free supper sponsored by Natalie Broussard, an Iberia Parish Coucilwoman vying for a district judge’s position in the upcoming election, was cooked by Pellerin on Sunday, which gave him just two of the three days to win his Boat Captain’s Award.
 Brittany Pool and the RugaRouxs played live music as scheduled in front of a large crowd from 6-9 p.m. Saturday under the pavilion along Quintana Canal. However, because of the rainy conditions and a light attendance for the awards presentation, the Bad Boys didn’t play as scheduled from 3-6 p.m. Sunday.
 Broussard, who has been fishing this event since 2012, finished with two fish on the final leaderboard on her way to winning the Inside Division Boat Captain’s Award with 539 points to turn back runner-up Hunter Romero, 469, and Stephanie Pellerin, 380. The champ had first- and second-place croakers (.79 and .78 pounds).
 “I’m excited. It’s the first time I ever won that big trophy over there,” she said before the awards presentation, pointing over her shoulder.
 The 61-year-old angler said the couple was hoping IR&GC officials would have the fishing rodeo. Robideaux and Broussard jumped at the chance.
 “We both love to fish. We’re diehard. We were fishing in the pouring down rain (Sunday). That’s what got my second-place croaker, fishing in the rain.”
 Pellerin, limited to two days of fishing, enjoyed every minute of the quest to win the Boat Captain’s Award. He fished with his wife and Karl Prados.
 “Ah, man, it’s awesome, awesome. We struggled, struggled. … We thought we struggled,” he said.
 The Pellerins and Prados put one of three drum and two “slot” redfish on the board Friday. The drum was a 24.90-pounder caught by Stephanie while both reds were caught by Prados.
 The woman on board also accounted for a flounder the second day that finished third to go along with her winning drum.
 “I was happy she was able to enjoy herself. My wife really doesn’t get to fish much but she grew up fishing this rodeo. Usually she can only fish one day but she was able to fish two,” Pellerin said.
 There was a story behind the clutch flounder. After her cast resulted in a backlash, she reeled out the slack and set the hook on the 1.21-pounder.
 Her husband was proud of the accomplishment.
 “People don’t realize in this Inside Division, they’ve got some animals fishing this rodeo. You’ve really got to fish this rodeo to win. It’s really an accomplishment to win,” he said.
 Dearman, who moved to Colorado five years ago from Lafayette, was able to get away on vacation and return to Acadiana. The 32-year-old medical device engineer said it has become tradition the past 12 years to fish the IR&GC fishing rodeo.
 “I look forward to it all year. I’m always looking forward to the next rodeo,” he said.
 His crew included the Duhons, Kevin Carter, Carter Kauffman and Jonathon Foreman, all of Lafayette, and Chris Landry of Ville Platte.
 That team scored perhaps the biggest triumph in fishing rodeo history last Fourth of July when it unseated Sea Mistress, a local boat that had a stranglehold on Boat Captain’s Awards since 2011. The Aorta B Fishin’s defense of the title, however, was dampened by the weather and a low turnout, especially locally, this past weekend.
 The Offshore Division categories were half empty. Still, Aorta B Fishin finished seven of the 14 fish when the scales closed Sunday.
 Michael Duhon had first-place bonita (10.25 pounds) and lemonfish (20 pounds), second-place lemonfish (19.75 pounds) and third-place mangrove snapper (4.60 pounds).
 Dearman accounted for a first-place barracuda (6.40 pounds).

“Though we’d originally planned to release the game one month earlier on August 28, finalizing everything in time for that launch date has become increasingly challenging due to the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, and the last thing we want to do is compromise the quality of the experience,” Hangar 13 tweeted.

Thoroughly looking forward to this. Will be in Galle for the first few days of that test match and then have tickets to day 3 at Lords for the West Indies.      Don't think this will be Jimmy's swansong though, he's mentioned several times that he wants to go to the Ashes at the end of next year so think we still have a few more summers in him yet.         I'm a bit bored of playing Australia every year now, I know it's a money maker but every 2 years is more than enough.

Mortgage rates have been extremely volatile lately, due to the effect of COVID-19 on the U.S. economy. Rates took a dive recently as the Fed announced low-interest rates across the board for the next two years. But rates could easily go back up if there's another big surge of mortgage applications or if the economy starts to strengthen again.
