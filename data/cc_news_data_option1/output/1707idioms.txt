In late March, Musk replied to a Twitter user who asked for help for Louisiana's hospitals, which she said didn't have access to N95 masks, the respirator masks intended for healthcare workers.
 "We'll try to get & deliver as many as possible," Musk said. "N95 masks are a pain to wear btw. Less onerous masks are better most of the time."
 It's not clear who Musk was encouraging to use "less onerous masks," but if worn correctly, N95 masks can block out at least 95% of small airborne particles and are recommended for frontline medical workers dealing with COVID-19 patients by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
 While Musk seemed to say Tesla would try to send a shipment of them to Louisiana hospitals, he also seemed to be encouraging switching to a looser- fitting mask like surgical masks, which do not protect healthy people from acquiring the illness. (Surgical masks are typically used by surgeons to prevent spreading their own germs to patients.)
 The CDC has since started advising that everyone wear some sort of cloth face covering when they go out in public to the grocery store or to pick up necessities.

Throughout the coronavirus pandemic in the US, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has been outspoken about his thoughts on everything from ventilator shortages to possible treatments to the severity of the virus overall.
 Now, Musk has gone a step further, calling US shelter-in-place orders "fascist" during a brief, expletive-laden rant during a conference call following Tesla's first-quarter earnings report on Wednesday.
 Musk has a history of speaking out during times of crisis. In 2018, for example, Musk offered to build a "kid-size" submarine to rescue 12 boys and their soccer coach stuck in a flooded cave in Thailand. When a British diver called Musk's actions a "PR stunt," Musk called the diver a "pedo guy" in a since-deleted tweet. (The comment sparked a defamation lawsuit, but Musk has since been cleared).
 He's also frequently shared his thoughts on everything from Tesla short- sellers to the media, and has landed in hot water over erratic tweets like his "funding secured" fiasco in 2018.

TALLAHASSEE -- Curtis Bryant registered to vote in September, thanks to a Florida constitutional amendment aimed at restoring voting rights to felons who have completed the terms of their sentences.
   
 But the 39-year-old father of three has yet to cast a ballot. He's afraid that voting might put him back behind bars, Bryant told a federal judge on Thursday.
   
 Bryant is one of the plaintiffs in a high-stakes trial in a challenge to a Florida law designed to carry out the constitutional amendment.
   
 The law, approved by the Republican-controlled Legislature last year, requires felons like Bryant who are no longer incarcerated to pay court-ordered "legal financial obligations" -- fees, fines, costs and restitution -- to be eligible to vote.
   
 Voting-rights groups that filed the lawsuit maintain that making voting rights contingent upon finances is an unconstitutional "poll tax," while Gov. Ron DeSantis and his administration assert that the law implements the language of the constitutional amendment. The trial, being conducted through videoconference because of the coronavirus, started Monday and will continue Friday.
   
 Bryant, a onetime crack dealer whose last conviction was in 2007, owes more than $10,000 in fees, fines and court costs, he told U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle during Thursday's testimony.
   
 The Orlando resident said he pays a collection agency $30 each month toward his court-ordered financial obligations, but it will take him years to erase the debt.
   
 Bryant, who said he lives paycheck-to-paycheck, said he did not vote in two municipal elections in Orange County because he feared he could be prosecuted for violating the law.
   
 "I can't afford any more charges and neither do I want any more charges," he said.
   
 Bryant said he joined the lawsuit as a plaintiff because "I think it's my time to vote," adding that he wants to vote, in part, to be a role model for his young son.
   
 "I wanted him to be a part of that, to see that his dad has come a long way, even though he doesn't know the person that I used to be," Bryant said.
   
 Bryant said he sought reassurance from state and local elections officials that he would not face prosecution if he voted, since he had outstanding legal financial obligations, but his efforts were futile.
   
 Bryant said he wants to vote in the fall elections, like "a regular person."
   
 "It's time for me to be heard. It's time for people to see the change in me. People can change, and live a different life, do better, become an example, a mentor, all of that. I believe I have accomplished that," he said.
   
 The outcome of the trial could have a significant impact on this year's presidential election in Florida, a critical swing state in national elections with a long history of close margins.
   
 More than 700,000 Floridians who were convicted of felonies -- dubbed "returning citizens" by proponents of what appeared as Amendment 4 on the November 2018 ballot -- have outstanding financial obligations but are eligible to vote otherwise, according to research performed by University of Florida political science professor Daniel Smith.
   
 In a preliminary injunction issued in October, Hinkle ruled the state cannot deny the right to vote to felons who are "genuinely unable" to pay financial obligations associated with their convictions. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the injunction, which applied only to the 17 named plaintiffs in the case. Hinkle this month granted class certification to plaintiffs, adding potentially hundreds of thousands of felons to the lawsuit.
   
 Hinkle's October ruling also ordered DeSantis' administration to come up with a process in which felons could try to prove they are unable to pay financial obligations and should be able to vote.
   
 The Republican governor's administration is fiercely defending the law, despite a series of decisions pointing toward a final decision by Hinkle in favor of the plaintiffs.
   
 In addition to Bryant's testimony Thursday, California Institute of Technology professor Morgan Kousser spoke at length about research he conducted regarding the 2019 legislation (SB 7066) and the history of felon disenfranchisement in Florida and elsewhere.
   
 The Florida Legislature "was aiming at a bill that had maximal disenfranchisement result" when crafting the law, Kousser, who specializes in "racially polarized voting," wrote in a 128-page report prepared for the plaintiffs.
   
 Florida legislators were repeatedly warned that requiring payment of fees, fines and restitution for felons to vote would have a disproportionately negative impact on black Floridians, who comprise about 20% of felons in the state, Kousser said.
   
 While questioning Kousser on Thursday, Leah Alden, a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, played numerous clips of lawmakers discussing the bill during the 2019 legislative session, prompting a scolding from Hinkle. The judge said the excerpts were unnecessary.
   
 Following the judge's admonition, Alden played a lengthy segment of Sen. Perry Thurston, a black Democrat from Fort Lauderdale, directly linking the Senate bill to Florida's ugly history of preventing African-Americans from participating in elections.
   
 At the end of the video, Hinkle announced he would give the defendants 10 minutes longer than the plaintiffs for closing arguments and would continue to dock time if the plaintiffs continued to ignore his warnings.
   
 Kousser testified that he believes partisanship and race are "inextricably intertwined" in Florida and the United States and that race is "completely imbued" in the struggle about felon disenfranchisement.
   
 "I don't think it can be separated. I think that would be another world. That would not be the world that we live in. That would be Sweden's history, Norway's history, something like that. That would not be Florida's history or America's history," he said.

COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on global smartphone market with shipments falling 13 per cent to 272 million units in March 2020 quarter, according to research firm Canalys. A report by Counterpoint Research also indicated a similar scenario stating that this is the first time since March 2014 quarter that the global smartphone shipments have fallen below 300 million units in a quarter.Canalys, in its report, pointed that the smartphone market had entered 2020 in good health, having just recorded two consecutive quarters of growth, but demand for new devices has been "crushed". Canalys Senior Analyst Ben Stanton said that in February, when the coronavirus was centered on China, vendors were mainly concerned about how to build enough smartphones to meet global demand."But in March, the situation flipped on its head. Smartphone manufacturing has now recovered, but as half the world entered lockdown, sales plummeted. Poor business results, employee redundancies and furloughs are causing a great deal of anxiety and uncertainty," he added. Stanton noted that smartphones are still a necessity for most people, and device availability in online channels has enabled those who need to replace a broken or lost phone to do so.But many customers who would have bought a new smartphone as a luxury have delayed that purchase, he said. Canalys said Samsung led the global tally with 21.9 per cent market share in March quarter, followed by Huawei (18 per cent), Apple (13.6 per cent), Xiaomi (11.1 per cent) and vivo (8.9 per cent).According to Counterpoint Research, the fall in first quarter was mainly driven by a 27 per cent year-on-year shipment decline in China, the initial epicentre of the pandemic. The disruption in China also impacted the supply side of handsets and components for some OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), which in turn, affected global shipments.In the long run, this could lead to OEMs diversifying their supply chain across regions, and this could be a silver lining for countries like India and Vietnam, it added. "Consumers, under these uncertain times, are likely to withhold making many significant discretionary purchases. This means the replacement cycles are likely to become longer," Tarun Pathak, Associate Director at Counterpoint Research, said."Lockdowns in most parts of the world will be lifted in a staggered way, which will mean it could take time before the retail activity completely resumes," he noted. He added that users staying at home, however, are engaging on their smartphone more than ever and this provides opportunities for services like mobile gaming and OTT services."This will likely lead to operators being able to upsell to larger data packages with higher ARPUs," he noted. Counterpoint expects the entry-level segment to be hit the most, especially in emerging economies, driven by impact on people's income in the unorganised labour sector and higher offline purchase tendency."The mid segment will continue to drive volumes. The premium segment is least likely to be directly affected by the economic meltdown. As the consumers would adjust to the new normal, the sales in the segment are likely to rebound," it said. According to Counterpoint's report, Samsung led the global tally with 20 per cent market share in March quarter. Huawei had 17 per cent share, followed by Apple (14 per cent), Xiaomi (10 per cent), Oppo (8 per cent) and vivo (7 per cent).Lenovo Group, realme, LG and Tecno each cornered 2 per cent share in the March quarter, it added..

The Savannah Bananas plan to play this season, and in front of spectators.
   
 The baseball team in the Coastal Plain League announced Wednesday it has pushed opening day from May 28 to July 1, and the regular-season finale from Aug. 3 to Sept. 3 followed by potential playoff games.
   
 The season is contingent on local, state and federal measures ending shelter- at-home restrictions because of the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 "We made this decision now because of the conversations we've been having as a league with owners and watching everything from a local, state and federal level," Bananas co-owner Jesse Cole said after a news conference at Grayson Stadium.
   
 "Building trust, building transparency with the fan base is so important," Cole continued. "Everyone is saying, 'We don't know. We don't know.' We need some certainty. We need that. This is as certain as we can get if by going by what we are being told as far as the safety we can provide for our fans. It's going to look different in the ballpark. But I think fans are willing to have that opportunity just to be able to get back out and have some fun."
   
 The Bananas needed to get a green light from the league as well as local government, as the city of Savannah owns Grayson Stadium.
   
 Savannah Mayor Van Johnson, who spoke at the news conference, said the July 1 start date seems "reasonable" given the current direction of the state opening back up with two more months to go.
   
 "Hopefully, prayerfully, based on the science, (on) July 1, the Banana nation will be back in full effect," he said at the podium.
   
 He said indicators are the rate of positive cases of the coronavirus, testing availability and the assessments of health professionals locally and nationally.
   
 "If the science says we can go through with this, I'm all for it," Johnson said after the news conference.
   
 The Bananas will still schedule 30 home dates. The seating capacity will be reduced by about 50% to about 2,000 -- down from about 4,100 -- unless social distancing guidelines are loosened, with groups of fans separated by at least two to four seats in the same row, and no spectators sitting directly in front of or behind others.
   
 "It's going to be a tough year. But the alternative is even worse than that," team president Jared Orton said of having no baseball season.
   
 Chat Howard, a season-ticket holder since the Bananas' debut in 2016, would not have been shocked if this league, as so many others in sports worldwide, had canceled the 2020 season.
   
 "It's nice to go in with low expectations and be pleasantly surprised," said Howard, 47, who has four season tickets and attends with family members. "I'm excited about it. The Bananas games are always a nice escape from reality. We're looking forward to it. I think it's a tough year for everyone. We need that escape. We need to be able to kick back, drink a beer and watch baseball at this point."
   
 Summer nights at the ballpark are part of what Savannah needs to get back to what Johnson called "operating in our new normal."
   
 "Our sports team is a part of that," he said. "It's a way of getting back out, getting people focused on positive things instead of the whole negative thing that we've been mired in since March."
   
 A tough ticket
   
 Because of the reduced seating, no single-game tickets will be sold this season, with the Bananas expecting to return to normal operations in 2021, which would be their sixth season in the collegiate summer league.
   
 The Bananas already were a tough ticket, with games sold out for entire seasons and a waiting list over 10,000, Orton said. The about 400 season- ticket holders will keep their tickets but their seats may change depending on the game.
   
 Those who already purchased general-seating tickets, such as for group outings and hospitality decks, were called by the team and informed of the new limitations.
   
 "We basically called them, you'll need to reduce your capacity by half just so we didn't have to say, you get to come out but then your group doesn't get to come out," Orton said. "If we can reduce everyone by half -- and everyone's been really happy to do that -- I think we'll allow everyone that wanted to come out the opportunity to come."
   
 Team officials said they are looking into live streaming of Bananas games, as well as possibly setting up a watch party in a neighboring field at Daffin Park on game nights.
   
 The game dates are set but opponents are to be determined as the CPL works out the logistics for the 15 teams in Georgia, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Expect more games for the Bananas against the teams closest to Savannah such as the Macon Bacon and the Lexington County Blowfish to reduce the time players are on the road.
   
 The Bananas, consisting of college baseball players and coaches, are to arrive in Savannah one to two weeks ahead of opening day. They will need the preparation as the college season was canceled in March because of the pandemic. The roster will be expanded to 40 players, with up to 35 active on game days, to help limit the wear and tear on the athletes in a compressed schedule.
   
 The Savannah Bananas office at Grayson Stadium will reopen Monday.

 "If somebody wants to stay in their house, that's great and they should be able to," he said. "But to say they cannot leave their house and that they will be arrested if they do, that's fascist. That is not democratic -- this is not freedom. Give people back their goddamn freedom."

This is due to internal influences such as free radicals, which are produced during inflammatory processes and cellular respiration, and external ones, such as cosmic background radiation or X-rays in the course of medical diagnostic measures. DNA strand breaks can lead to cell death or to mutations and thus contribute in the long term to cancer development or the aging process.
