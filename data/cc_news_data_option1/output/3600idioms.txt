A tree ripened peach needs nothing but a place for the juice to drip after your face dives into it. It is like no other fruit, with a complex bouquet of flavors that changes from peach to peach, fine-tuned by the subtle weather patterns that are different each summer. When allowed to properly ripen on a tree, the flavor of a ripe peach is joyfully explosive, which is why the orchard that grows the world's best peaches is often the one closest to your house.      Once you've gotten used to properly ripened peaches, the store-bought alternatives quickly lose their appeal. That disappointment in the available peaches is what inspired Tom and Lynn McCamant, my peach growers here in Montana, to start Forbidden Fruit Orchard, which might literally grow the best peaches in the world. No, really.      I buy their peaches by the boxload, at both Tuesday and Saturday markets in Missoula. Whether I'm enjoying them fresh or preserving them at the peak of freshness for later use, there are few local foods as shockingly special as peaches and decidedly superior to the imported version as peaches, and now is the time to get on it.      For both preserving and cooking, look for free-stone peaches, the flesh of which easily relinquishes the seed. The other category, called clingstone, are fine for eating -- you barely notice a difference. It's impossible to tell from the outside if a peach is free- or clingstone; you have to ask.      I spend the majority of my peach-eating time leaning over the sink, my face plunging repeatedly into juicy, messy peach flesh. But when peaches are in season, we can afford to mess around. Tom's favorite way is diced with heavy cream (40% fat -- the stuff at Costo in the half-gallon cartons).      I used to forever be on the hunt for new ways to preserve my peaches, so as to enjoy their sweet glory through winter. I'd can them in quart jars, spending hours in the steamy kitchen blanching and peeling and sealing bright orange peach halves in syrup, or putting away pints of jam, sometimes with blueberries or huckleberries. I finally settled on peach slices in the dehydrator as my go-to peach storage technique. Each slice is like a drop of sunshine, and they are among the most treasured items in my freezer.      During the deliciously long evenings of summer, when the coals are still warm, I've been laying peach halves on the grill, fuzzy-sides down. Sometimes I'll add pieces of chopped ham and pickled peppers to the spot where the pit used to be, and top it with cheese. When the cheese melts, I'll sometimes drizzle balsamic vinegar or reduction. The blend of fatty, fruity and savory flavors has the wide ranging complexity of bacon-wrapped cheese-stuffed fig.      I asked Tom if he'd ever tried grilling peaches, and he admitted that he had not. But he told me about a dish called peach sambal. By the time Lynn sent me the recipe I had already gotten involved with another peach sambal recipe which I'd met online. It calls for a spicy Indonesian red pepper and garlic paste called sambal oelek, which is available in most Asian grocery aisles. It also has lots of turmeric.      I've been making it with chicken, marinating whole quarters in fresh garlic, lemon, turmeric and other flavorings, along with crushed peaches, and then grilling or broiling the chicken. The balance between the turmeric, peach and chile paste is otherworldly. Only available in this world for a short, peachy time.      Peach Sambal with Chicken   Lots of people want to eat turmeric these days, as it is thought to reduce inflammation in joints and elsewhere. It's the main component of curry powder, and accordingly makes this dish taste curry-like. You can substitute curry powder of your choice for the turmeric.   Serves 4   3 pounds chicken pieces or quarters   ½ cup fresh lemon juice   ¼ cup sambal oelek (or less, depending on your spice tolerance)   ¼ cup oyster or fish sauce   2 tablespoons sesame oil   ¼ cup olive oil   3 teaspoons turmeric or curry powder   4 extra ripe peaches, cut into 1/8ths (peeled or not)   ½ cup heavy cream or coconut milk   2 tablespoons soy sauce   Salt and pepper to taste      Add lemon juice, sambal oelek, oyster sauce and sesame oil to a small mixing bowl and whisk together. Rub the chicken with olive oil and add the rest of the oil to the sauce. Rub the chicken pieces with turmeric. Pour the marinade over the chicken in a large mixing bowl.      Squeeze the peaches and add them to the bowl, and mix it all together with your hands, squeezing the juice from the peaches as you mix. Let sit for at least three hours, covered in the fridge; preferably overnight.      Grill the chicken -- or broil, if you don't have a grill available. Let it cook until the skin blackens and blisters.      While it cooks, add the remaining sauce to a pan along with the heavy cream or coconut milk, and bring it to a simmer. Season with soy sauce and black pepper.      When the chicken is done, pour the sauce over the chicken and serve. Enjoy the glorious combination of blackened, blistered skin and sweet, tangy, quietly complex, decidedly peachy sauce.      And if you have room for more, throw a few peach halves on the embers of summer.

"I never before knew the full value of trees. My house is entirely embosomed in high plane-trees, with good grass below; and under them I breakfast, dine, write, read, and receive my company"   \- Thomas Jefferson, 1793      Due to staying home with the pandemic the past six months, I have done some major work in the garden. I had not realized how some plants needed a good pruning and a few plants had even outgrown their space and needed to be moved. I had shrubs with a lot of dead wood that needed to be taken out and I could not believe I did not notice this before. I got out old photos of areas in the garden and was amazed at how the garden had slowly changed.      As I have been working, I would have to remind myself to follow some basic principles of design that have helped me over the years. I started out as a collector and realized years ago, I needed order to my garden and to have some "bones" or structure in some places where things were lacking.      Some of the things I try to remember are not to make it too much of a "hodge- podge" of plant material. Variety is important, but do not overdo it. Balance, proportion and unity are important. You need to think about a garden as an extension of your home and think about how you decorate a room. You use some of these same ideas when making a room in the garden.      You need different shapes, sizes, texture and form. If the entire yard were all the same, it would not be very interesting. It is good to balance things in the garden. If you have something on one side of a path, repeat it to give some balance on the other side.      If you are starting from scratch to landscape an area or just making some little changes, you start with trees. This could be trees that are in place now or the trees that you want to consider adding. They could also be borrowed trees that overhang your property from a neighbor's garden. Trees are the main landscaping feature. Start with letting the trees you have or are considering planting be the first thing to guide your landscape.      Trees set the stage and give you different options when planning. You can use them to have dappled shade, woodland shade or have deep shade if you want to create a woodland garden. Trees can help you divide areas into rooms.      The second thing to consider is the "bones" of the garden. Good gardens have good bones and winter is a good time to see this. The greenery that catches your eye or architectural elements like walls, fences, patios, pathways or arbors are the solid elements of a garden. Make sure you have enough greenery to give your garden an attractive look in the winter months.      The third thing is to make sure your garden has some unity, consistency and repetition. The garden needs to flow or have some cohesive factor to hold it together. If you have azaleas in one garden area or room, put another one here or there to tie the garden together. Repetition helps keep the garden pulled together. Repeat plants, colors, shapes and textures in different areas.      If color is going to be used, make sure the colors work together. Color adds a dimension of life and interest to the landscape. I believe artists create some of the most beautiful gardens because they understand color. They know how to use different hues and shades together. Whether you are considering creating a garden with just shades of green or with a mass of color, it is important to use color in a harmonizing way.      I have a bad habit of buying a plant in a garden center that catches my eye and then trying to find a spot for it. You should think about what you need and then buy a plant. Have a reason for purchasing the item for your garden. Is the color right? Bright colors like reds, oranges and yellows make objects seem closer to you whereas cooler colors like greens, blues and pastels seem to move away from you or seem farther away.      Be sure not to forget green. You can have a wonderful all green garden. Green is calming and gives you time to pause and rest. You can create an area of all green using different textures and shapes and sizes. Many Japanese gardens are mainly green with just a touch of color during each season.      Think about edging or borders. These are functional elements as well as decorative. They give the garden some definition. It keeps plants from encroaching and it lets you know which way to go. Brick, cobblestone, boxwood and split bamboo are some of the edgings you can use. You can just use mulch to tie the garden together and make a neat edge for the plants. This helps define your space and let visitors know which way to go.      Designing a garden can take time. You can plant trees first and then work on the different shrubs you want to plant next. Everything does not have to be done at once. Plants can be expensive, especially if you plant larger sizes. Take your time and you will get the feel you want. Be sure to take photographs too. I often print photos of an area on copy paper and draw on them. Trying to see what needs to go where.   Create a garden that fits your lifestyle and your needs at the time. Remember, you can always change things as your needs change. Today you might need places for children to play and later you might want a place to entertain and relax. You can plant that tree now that you will want to have as shade later when you have more time to relax and enjoy the garden.

Community members contributed more than $410,000 to the fund during the months of March, April and May.
 This fund has given direct assistance to more than 300 Chaffee County households and 28 non-profit organizations.
 “As donations have slowed and applications continue to come through, the current fund un-allocated balance will dwindle to $0 by early October if not sooner,” the foundation wrote in an email.
 The foundation board is retaining a balance in the fund, cognizant that this is in the best interest of the community, ensuring the collective ability to respond to COVID-19 and other disasters or emergencies that honor emergency needs, the foundation wrote.
 The foundation coordinates with Chaffee County Department of Human Services and Public Health.
 Individuals in need of asssistance can continue applying to the department of human services by calling 719-530-2500 or online from at chaffeecommunity.org/erf.
 The foundation is asking community members to consider ERF donations this fall, and the foundation will continue to reassess its ability to re-open individual assistance applications based on the available resources as well as community needs.
 The foundation continues its other emergency response fund work focused on building capacity of food access and youth-serving organizations.
 Joseph Teipel, foundation executive director says “We are incredibly hopeful for the future and thankful to the Chaffee community for stepping up to help those in need due to this pandemic. We remain committed to serving this community and ensuring it has the resources it needs far into the future.”
