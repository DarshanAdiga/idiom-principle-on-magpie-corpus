GARDNER - Local moviegoers will have to wait a little longer before seeing any new films on the big screen.
 In response to the ongoing COVID pandemic, Hollywood has removed most of its new releases, including James Bond and the sequel to "Top Gun," from this year's schedule and have planned to open them sometime in 2021. The lack of new movies has caused the Regal theater chain to temporarily close all of its 536 locations across the country, and has pushed local movie theater, Gardner Cinemas, to find new strategies to get through the year with i.r. private screening and take out.
 Gardner Cinemas co-owner Chris Daigle has hit upon a successful formula to stay open while keeping local audiences in the habit of going to the movies by offering private screenings of classic movies as well as curbside concession sales.
 "We put a list (of movies) out there that is generated mostly by requests that we've gotten," Daigle said, adding that screenings of movies such as "Jurassic Park" and "Back to the Future" had proven to be very popular for private groups that want to rent the theater.
 The capacity for the shows is limited to 25, but Daigle said most of the screenings averaged about 10 or 12 people. "People are with their own families or their own friends, so they feel comfortable, which is great for us. We've had a bunch of couples come in to just watch a movie by themselves."
 The private screenings mean the theater can tailor their available titles in accordance with the season. With Halloween right around the corner, Daigle said he would be offering the horror classic "Scream" after receiving several requests for the title. Movies available this month at Gardner Cinemas include "Hocus Pocus," "Shrek," "Gremlins," and "The Empire Strikes Back."
 "If I know I can get a few bookings out of (a movie), I can at least break even on paying the licensing fee, so I'll bring it in and offer it to everybody else," Daigle said. "We're just trying to scrape and claw as best as we can until we get to the other side of this, whenever that is."
 Daigle said one of the main factors in decided which requests to honor was whether or not a movie had a broad appeal that would bring in others to the theater. But he said if a title was available for licensing, he would do his best to accommodate all requests.
 Community support for the screenings and curbside popcorn sales had been overwhelming, Daigle said.
 "The feedback we hear and just the kindness we see, it's just been tremendous," he said, adding that other theaters had tried to emulate his strategy but had not found much success. "Other places just couldn't make it work, and I think it's just a function of our community that we've gotten so much support. We have a lot of regulars who come here every single week."
 The success of the private screenings and concession sales meant the theater might even be able to bring back some of its employees to work regular hours, Daigle said. Up until now, he said, all theater operations were being handled by members of his family and those of co-owner, David Worthley.
 "That's the difference between a family-run operation and a chain, because with a chain you'd have to bring in staff," he said. "But for us, the two families that own (the theater), we're just doing whatever we can to get out of this with the least amount of debt as we can."
 When will it go back to normal?
 According to Daigle, one of the only new big screen offerings still on this year's schedule is Disney's "Soul," which is slated to open in December. But he said that all signs indicate that that movie, too, will be pushed back until next year.
 "So that really leaves nothing to play that's really of any significance that's new from now until the end of November," Daigle explained, adding that "Wonder Woman" was still scheduled to open this Christmas. He compared the situation currently faced by the movie theater industry to the classic Chicken and the Egg conundrum. "Theaters have to be open for Hollywood to release new product, but Hollywood has to release new product for theaters to be open."
 Daigle said several theaters in the area opened last month as a sort of test run and showed the big-budget sci-fi action movie "Tenet" to bring in audiences. But, he said, turnout for the film was lackluster and most theaters, including Cinema World in Fitchburg, shut its doors again after a few weeks.
 "They're closing because you lose more money by opening than you do by staying closed," Daigle explained. "So a lot of theaters are going into hibernation, as they call it, because once you open up the doors for a regular schedule, you're turning on the heat or the air-conditioners for 12 hours a day for every auditorium, you have to pay staff for everybody to be there for 80 or 90 hours a week, and then to pay licensing fees to show new films becomes exorbitant as well."
 Another movie that Hollywood hoped might draw audiences back into the theater was Disney's "Mulan," but the studio decided to release it on Disney-Plus instead, Daigle said.
 "None of that helped," Daigle added.

MARSHFIELD - The 2019 Marshfield High girls soccer team made a decent run to get into the postseason, only to be ousted after a tight competitive, game, 2-0 by Bishop Feehan. The Rams' disappointment at that loss was assuaged a bit when the Shamrocks (23-0-1) went on to win the Division 1 state championship.
 But there won't be much chance of building off the pride of a close battle with the state champs, because the bulk of that 2019 team's core graduated. How much soccer talent that 2019 class contained might be seen by noting that players from that group now play for the University of Rhode Island, University of Massachusetts, Bryant University, and Salve Regina.
 It's not like the cupboard is bare but the 2020 Rams will have a few veterans, and many more players either joining varsity for the first time, or seeing their first substantial minutes at the top level. Coach Dominic Centorino welcomed a stunning 71 candidates to the opening of practice this fall, so the varsity, JVs and freshman teams will all be fully stocked. And the Patriot League 'bubble' schedule is a bit unusual, in a good way for a young team, as five of the Rams' first six games are at home. They started the season Friday with a 6-0 loss to Hingham.
 "We lost a really strong senior core to graduation," said Centorino. "I would say at least three of them were just stellar athletes, the kind that are very hard to replace. This year's team is going to have to have a whole new identity of its own. We have some carryover, in returning players, but the new rules and everything make it all initially a bit overwhelming. I think our starting later this year has all the girls itching to get out there and play soccer, but it also leaves us a little behind on team bonding. Ultimately this season will be about the girls having fun, and bonding with their teammates, and we're just hoping to emphasize that, while playing good, competitive soccer."
 Marshfield has a couple of veteran captains in seniors Sam McGregor and Julie Alcaro, and the latter has a real desire to get back into action. Alcaro tore up her knee and missed all of her junior season.
 "They are a good pair of players to build around, and they are helping the other girls learn what it takes," said Centorino. "We kept as many players as we could this fall, so we have 29 players on our varsity team, and it is very senior-heavy, with 15 seniors. So I think that class will play a big role here, and Sam and Julie are excellent leaders."
 A couple of other veterans will play major roles for the new-look Rams, in juniors Riley Drosopoulos, a defender, and Bridgette Barrowman, an offensive- minded midfielder.
 "Riley is an outstanding back and we're lucky to have her," said Centorino, "while Bridgette is a junior who's basically been a starter since her freshman year. Those are two really important cogs for us."
 Marshfield High's reboot had to begin in net, where the 2019 team had standout netminder Kate McNeill.
 "We'll have senior Stella Scholfield and sophomore Sydney Sheehan playing goalkeeper for us," said Centorino. "They have both looked good so far. We also have a freshman goalie playing on the JVs - it's always good to have a couple goalies in the system, and after graduating Kate we had to replenish that position."
 Some other key performers come from all the classes.
 "We're looking for a big season from senior Laney Zaslaw, who scored a hat trick against Cohasset last year," noted Centorino. "And Laney has her kid sister, sophomore Sammy Zaslaw, a midfielder also on the team. We have two sets of sisters, with Sam McGregor's sophomore sister Maddie, a defender and midfielder, joining us, so that's always a good thing."
 "Mya D'Antonio is another young player with lots of potential, a sophomore forward who came up as a freshman last year," said Centorino. "And then we have junior Nadia Kiziuk, a very skilled midfielder. Sydney McCabe is another fine midfielder player, a junior, as is forward Sara Weijkus, and they've done well."
 "A couple of seniors we're looking to are forward Celine LeDoux and midfielder Gwyn O'Sullivan, and they are certainly in the mix too," said Centorino.
 When you get to the more specific roles, it isn't quite as clear who might emerge as the Rams scoring threats.
 "Last year we shared the wealth, and no one person scored a lot of goals," said Centorino. "I suspect it may be that way again. We have a lot of forwards this year, and we'll try and rotate them all in. One thing that helps there is the quarters format, instead of just playing halves like we did before. Four periods will help break it up and help us manage everyone's minutes better."
 The new pandemic MIAA rules changes are also likely to boost offense. There are no throw-ins but rather kick-ins, no heading the ball, no slide tackles, and minimal shoulder to shoulder contact allowed. Most observers would suggest it will make playing defense even more difficult.
 "We are expecting there will be penalties and a lot of indirect kicks for contact fouls," said Centorino. "And with teams unable to form defensive walls, those set plays become even more important. I think we are expecting a big season from Julie Alcaro, who has been itching to play for over a year, and did a lot of work to recover from her knee injury. We also expect to get some scoring from Bridgette Barrowman out of the midfield, as well as Laney Zaslaw, and Syndey McCabe."
 The Rams have studied the new rules and played two pre-season scrimmages, with referees to help them adjust.
 "Initially we all had some officials do a Zoom meeting to explain the new rules, and how they would be interpreted," Centorino explained. "My first impression was that this could be a high-scoring season for everyone, and from what we've seen it will be, but not absurdly so. I also believe the boys game is much more physical and faster than our game, so it may not be as big an adjustment for us. The silver lining, for us coaches, is that the key to playing with this new rulebook is stressing possession. We have to be more deliberate and patient with how we progress the ball down the field. And those direct free kicks with no wall will be big plays."
 "Our defenders have had two scrimmages with game officials to help us adjust," Centorino added. "The officials we had took the time to explain the calls they made, and those scrimmages - against Pembroke and Silver Lake - really helped us. If you kick the ball in the air, for example, it's a re-start. We have to play within the confines of the new rules, and find a way to be successful. But none of us wants a whistle every two minutes, or to ruin the flow of the game. We are hoping for consistency in enforcing the rules, and we know the officials' job is hard. But the main goal, is for everyone involved to have some fun playing soccer, and hopefully developing their skills, while enjoying all the social and emotional benefits of being part of a team"
 After the Rams' opening game, the state lifted restrictions on crowd sizes, so they anticipate being able to have up to 250 fans for each remaining home game. All the players and coaches were anxious to get going, and they have had to basically shrug off any misgivings about getting a late start and a compressed season. But once again, Marshfield becoming a full-fledged member of the Patriot League this fall has eased the way, and provided a competitive 11-game season.
 "There was a time we didn't know if this season would happen," Centorino admitted. "Finally they gave us a date and a structure, and we got to work. We do miss having more pre-season time, but we have 11 girls who play year-round, which helps. Every other team is in the same boat as far as limited practice, and I think we miss the opportunity for team bonding most of all. I have to give Bill Battis, our athletic director, a lot of thanks for all he's done, because he's been awesome, and brings so much credibility to our program. Our tryouts went well, the team looks good so far, and everyone is in agreement - it's great to be back."

The safe delivery of vaccines for mass immunisation against COVID-19 is a massive challenge and India will need to significantly ramp up its cold chain facilities, say experts as the world&amp;rsquo;s second most populous nation moves into the next stage of management of the disease and looks towards a preventive. With most frontrunner vaccine candidates likely to require extra cold&amp;rsquo; storage, the private sector could also be roped in for effective delivery of a preventive when it is available, suggest several experts and industry insiders.Some vaccine frontrunners are in advanced stages of trial and could hit the market by early next year, making the task of securing last mile connectivity and ensuring that nothing goes wrong before the shot is administered more urgent. Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said earlier this week that the government expects to receive and utilise 400-500 million vaccine doses for COVID-19, and cover approximately 20-25 crore people by July 2021. The Centre has also reportedly directed states to make a robust plan for vaccine storage and distribution by October 15.Most if not all the current frontrunners require extremely stringent cold chains, making them immensely challenging for India to implement, said Satyajit Rath from New Delhi&amp;rsquo;s National Institute of Immunology (NII). The immunologist noted that some COVID-19 vaccines will need storage temperatures that simply cannot be realistically managed in any large-scale Indian campaign.He said the real problems will arise once vaccines are ready to go into the market. Vaccine candidates by Moderna and Pfizer will require stringent standards for refrigeration that may hamper how they are distributed to millions of people across India&amp;rsquo;s length and breadth, according to scientists. Unlike drugs, virtually all vaccines need to be transported at cold temperatures, usually between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius, said Raghavan Varadarajan, professor at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bengaluru.The necessity is to keep the vaccine product cold, either refrigerated or frozen. This is a constraint especially with large numbers of doses, Varadarajan told PTI, explaining the particular problems of India that has a population of 1.3 billion, second only to China. Many vaccines lose potency when exposed to higher temperatures, he said, and re-cooling does not help.Thus we need what is called the cold chain of handling before use, said Varadarajan whose team at IISc is working on a warm vaccine that can be stored for over a month at 37 degrees Celsius, and needs no cold chain for storage. PawanexhKohli, the founding CEO of India&amp;rsquo;s National Centre for Cold-Chain Development (NCCD), agreed that protocols will require COVID-19 vaccines to be kept between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius, while in transport and storage until delivery. The Moderna vaccine candidate is shipped in minus 20 degrees Celsius and held at 2-4 degrees for seven days. The Pfizer (vaccine) that requires minus 70 degrees temperatures, Kohli, honorary professor of post-harvest Logistics at the University of Birmingham in the UK, told PTI.Both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines use a synthetic version of genetic material from part of the coronavirus. The genetic material called messenger RNA (mRNA) then prompts the cells to make a tiny piece of the virus, which the immune system recognises as foreign. If the person is later exposed to the real virus, the immune system will attack it.Noting that RNA vaccines have never been used on humans, Vardarajan said it is possible high temperatures can affect these structures and thus affect the efficacy of the formulation.

I ragazzi di coach Raho affronteranno i ravennati in casa il 23 gennaio 2021 alle 18 e ricambieranno la visita alla penultima partita in programma il 24 aprile sempre alla stessa ora prima di chiudere la regular season una settimana piu tardi al PalaRaschi contro lo Stadium Mirandola in quello che potrebbe essere un potenziale big match da piani alti.

Accedono alla seconda fase le prime due classificate di ciascuno dei dieci gironi (in totale venti squadre): le prime si sfideranno tra andata e ritorno piu eventuale golden set in caso di parita e le cinque vincenti saranno promosse in Serie A3. Le perdenti, al contrario, rientreranno in gioco con le cinque seconde che si sono aggiudicate i rimanenti confronti e da li (la migliore si qualifica direttamente all'atto finale) si giungera, attraverso le semifinali in gara secca, a un concentramento a tre in campo neutro da dove uscira il nome della sesta e ultima promossa in categoria superiore.

The safe delivery of vaccines for mass immunisation against COVID-19 is a massive challenge and India will need to significantly ramp up its cold chain facilities, say experts as the world's second most populous nation moves into the next stage of management of the disease and looks towards a preventive. With most frontrunner vaccine candidates likely to require extra cold' storage, the private sector could also be roped in for effective delivery of a preventive when it is available, suggest several experts and industry insiders.
 Some vaccine frontrunners are in advanced stages of trial and could hit the market by early next year, making the task of securing last mile connectivity and ensuring that nothing goes wrong before the shot is administered more urgent. Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said earlier this week that the government expects to receive and utilise 400-500 million vaccine doses for COVID-19, and cover approximately 20-25 crore people by July 2021. The Centre has also reportedly directed states to make a robust plan for vaccine storage and distribution by October 15.
 Most if not all the current frontrunners require extremely stringent cold chains, making them immensely challenging for India to implement, said Satyajit Rath from New Delhi's National Institute of Immunology (NII). The immunologist noted that some COVID-19 vaccines will need storage temperatures that simply cannot be realistically managed in any large-scale Indian campaign.
 He said the real problems will arise once vaccines are ready to go into the market. Vaccine candidates by Moderna and Pfizer will require stringent standards for refrigeration that may hamper how they are distributed to millions of people across India's length and breadth, according to scientists. Unlike drugs, virtually all vaccines need to be transported at cold temperatures, usually between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius, said Raghavan Varadarajan, professor at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bengaluru.
 The necessity is to keep the vaccine product cold, either refrigerated or frozen. This is a constraint especially with large numbers of doses, Varadarajan told PTI, explaining the particular problems of India that has a population of 1.3 billion, second only to China. Many vaccines lose potency when exposed to higher temperatures, he said, and re-cooling does not help.
 Thus we need what is called the cold chain of handling before use, said Varadarajan whose team at IISc is working on a warm vaccine that can be stored for over a month at 37 degrees Celsius, and needs no cold chain for storage. PawanexhKohli, the founding CEO of India's National Centre for Cold-Chain Development (NCCD), agreed that protocols will require COVID-19 vaccines to be kept between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius, while in transport and storage until delivery. The Moderna vaccine candidate is shipped in minus 20 degrees Celsius and held at 2-4 degrees for seven days. The Pfizer (vaccine) that requires minus 70 degrees temperatures, Kohli, honorary professor of post-harvest Logistics at the University of Birmingham in the UK, told PTI.
 Both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines use a synthetic version of genetic material from part of the coronavirus. The genetic material called messenger RNA (mRNA) then prompts the cells to make a tiny piece of the virus, which the immune system recognises as foreign. If the person is later exposed to the real virus, the immune system will attack it.
 Noting that RNA vaccines have never been used on humans, Vardarajan said it is possible high temperatures can affect these structures and thus affect the efficacy of the formulation. While a bulk of the vaccines will be distributed through the Centre's Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) mechanism, experts also suggest that the government rope in private cold chain operators.
 The vast scale of India's UIP is supported by more than 27,000 functional cold chain points of which 750 (3 per cent) are located at the district level and above. The rest are located below the district level, according to the government's comprehensive multi-year UIP plan for 2018-22. This includes 76,000 cold chain 'equipment', 2.5 million health workers, and 55,000 cold chain staff, the plan report said.
 Cold chain logistics involves many moving parts, including cold storage facilities that store products waiting to be transported, cooling systemsto keep it at an appropriate temperature during all aspects of the supply chain such as storing and transporting.Gel packsare alsooften used for medical and pharmaceutical shipments. Approximately 390 million doses are administered annually at nine million sessions held across the country to immunise 26 million children and 30 million pregnant women, it said.

In 1994, the fishery had a nine-day season and was managed with traditional commercial fishing licenses. In 2001, it transitioned to a catch share management system, with a set quota divided among fishermen and a season that now lasted seven months. Pfeiffer crunched data pulled from fishing records with information from the National Weather Service. She tracked high wind days — where fishermen would face rough waves and stormy conditions.
