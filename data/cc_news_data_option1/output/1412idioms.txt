Jimba is not the only student to try to reason with her school's administration. Students across the country have argued — and organized around the idea — that universities should grant them leniency when it comes to grades for this semester as the stress and uncertainty of the pandemic has made it difficult to focus on or prioritize their studies. "I spent my entire spring break trying to advocate for students most vulnerable to economic, mental and physical harm during this pandemic," said Charlie Jones, a junior at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie who is a co creator of the "Nobody Fails VC" campaign arguing for a Universal Pass at the school.
 Students at Simmons College in Boston, Cornell University and several other colleges have created petitions and contacted their administration to argue why it is unethical to allow a student to fail or stress about their GPA during a global pandemic, and students at Yale University successfully convinced the administration to switch to a Universal Pass grading system for the spring 2020 semester.
 Other schools have held back on changing grading policies because they're worried about accreditation issues if they remove grades for the semester. That's despite the fact that some colleges, such as Brown University, have been entirely grade-optional for decades.
 "Schools do not jeopardize their accreditation status if they changed their grading system in light of COVID-19," confirmed Sonny Ramaswamy, who leads the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities, a regional accreditation agency. "We have had a number of our institutions switch from a letter grade to a pass/fail option, which we have approved, in line with the guidance from the US Department of Education. We only require that if the institution switches to a pass/fail system or give all students an A grade only, they must apply it fairly and equitably to all students."
 While the majority of students seem to be vouching for a universal pass-fail policy, there is also a significant number of students who would prefer to be graded as usual. Some students who are interested in graduate school, for example, might be hoping to boost their GPA this semester, especially as programs like Harvard Medical School have announced that although they will accept pass-fail grading for spring 2020 coursework, they would prefer letter grades if students were given that option at their particular school.
 No matter what grading policy a college adopts, said Diego Gomez, a student at Amherst College, it is imperative that schools are understanding towards student's needs and get their input before moving forward. "Any time I think about it, I cannot believe my schoolwork is being assessed and graded during a pandemic," he said. "Having the chance to get good grades, in my view, should not be one of the reasons I am working to keep myself and my family healthy right now."

“Some runners are using running as a way to relieve stress right now,” she said. “You can do little laps in a balcony or stairs or a little yard.”
 Fears of infection and the need for social distancing have also spurred new rules of etiquette, especially as concerns grow over how much of a distance from other runners is considered safe.
 Some runners are wearing a Buff, a versatile tubular garment popular in the sport, to cover their mouth and nose. Others wear masks and gloves, and think twice about where and when to clear their throats or spit during long runs.
 And others are practicing the “coronavirus swerve,” giving people a wide berth on streets, sidewalks and trails.
 Michael Wardian, 45, an elite ultramarathon runner who lives in Arlington, Va., said he no longer goes on group runs or meets with a personal trainer as part of his routine.
 “It has completely changed,” he said.
 His strenuous off-road runs have been transformed. “Even my secret hidden trials are overrun with people now, because everyone has found the outside,” Mr. Wardian said. “Places where I would go for solitude are not as conducive for that.”
 Rob Tidwell, 49, of King George, Va., and his family have also reassessed the tracts of wilderness they once plied, giving up their forest and Shenandoah mountain routes and sticking instead to their neighborhood, which has become the more remote spot.
 “People are flocking to the parks and trails are getting closed,” he said. “The last time we went out of our neighborhood to the park, it was packed with people.”
 For Anna Carlsson, 34, a long distance runner, the opposite is true. Her favorite wilderness spots have been abandoned as visitors stopped traveling to her village of Abisko, Sweden, near the Arctic Circle.
 Ms. Carlsson said she would normally not be putting in miles near Abisko at this time of year. But with marathons canceled, she saw no need to trek south for her usual spring training.
 Instead, she is making do with the slippery mountain tracks carved out by snowmobiles, or sprinting across the frozen surface of Lake Tornetrask.
 “A lot of tourists are usually here at this time of year because of the northern lights,” she said. “But right now it is super quiet.”
 But Ms. Carlsson and others are still finding a way to be competitive, as races crop up online to replace the isolation-averse contests on public streets, where spectators press against barricades and runners move in dense packs.
 Ms. Carlsson was one of more than 2,413 people in 56 countries who took part in a virtual race, the Quarantine Backyard Ultra, this month, distant in geography but united online from their living rooms, backyards and neighborhood streets.
 In Dubai, a Russian man ran around his living room for 20 hours. A Canadian, Matt Shepard, wanted to avoid frostbite so he ran part of the race inside a coffee shop in Valleyview, Alberta, that had been closed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Greg Armstrong, of Lebanon, Tenn., had to pause on his treadmill at one point to remove a snake from his house.
 The goal was to complete 4.17 miles at any pace in each of 63 consecutive hours of running, or a total of just over 262 miles. The overall winner would be “the last person standing,” said Stephanie Gillis-Paulgaard, an organizer.
 At 9 a.m. on April 4, Mr. Wardian, the runner from Virginia, set off on a loop of less than a half-mile around his house. As he passed again and again, his neighbors rang bells and cheered from a distance.
 It was a close finish. On April 6 at 11:31 p.m., Mr. Wardian won after a Czech competitor on a treadmill, Radek Brunner, was disqualified on a technicality after he began his 63rd hour too late after the starting bell, Ms. Gillis- Paulgaard said.
 “At the end it was down to me and one incredible athlete,” Mr. Wardian said in a video message on Twitter. “Radek was pushing me beyond anything I think both of us had ever done in the past.”
 The prize? A plaque bearing a gold-painted toilet roll, a comic nod to one of the items most hoarded by pandemic shoppers.

Yet many universities have been hesitant to make changes to their grading system for the semester despite how drastically students' lives have changed in light of the pandemic. Some schools put the power in their students' hands: Colby College in Maine, the University of California Davis and the University of Vermont, where van Arsdale attends, have given students the option between taking a course for a grade or taking a class pass-fail.
 "Our goal was to give students as much flexibility and choice as possible and allow our students to focus on learning and doing their best work knowing that they have control over how they are evaluated," explained Margaret McFadden, who oversaw the changes to the college's grading system for the semester.
 Other schools have made all courses pass-fail, including a handful of Ivy League schools like Yale University and Columbia University.
 "I live in a cramped apartment with my family where most of my work must be completed on my mattress or on the floor," said Miskiyat Jimba, a senior at Amherst College. "My ability to complete coursework at home is drastically different than what I was capable of at school. " Amherst College has extended their pass-fail deadline amid coronavirus, but Jimba and her friends said they reached out to the Provost and Dean of Faculty to advocate for more drastic changes.

On top of that, Dutton said in March that questions about Ruiz's candidacy had first been flagged for him a few weeks before the election after an anonymous letter was sent to his law office, pointing out inconsistencies between Ruiz and a "Natasha Nicole Demming." Attached to the letter was a copy of a Harris County voter registration record for Demming, which included an address and phone number that matched the paperwork Ruiz filed with the local party. Ruiz, on that paperwork, listed her full name as "Natasha Demming Ruiz" and her ballot name as "Natasha Ruiz," and listed her occupation as a teacher.

Soldiers' emotional well-being can be tested when deployed to a war zone — especially if it's their first experience.
 The name Rumi is a play off one of the nearby towns. Koontz says that at the beginning the dog was curious though a bit skittish — the way abused dogs behave.
 Animals are frowned upon on U.S. military bases. They can bring disease or cause problems with security — especially their barking. But Koontz's higher- ups gave her the green light to keep Rumi. She started feeding her every morning after overnight shifts as a fire support officer.
 "She kind of struck a chord with me that she's just this adorable sweet dog in a war zone," Koontz says. "And she's cold and wet and alone."
 Koontz is assigned to the 21st Infantry Division based in Alaska. Her deployment in Syria ends in May, though the current coronavirus pandemic may delay her return home. She felt it would be cruel to get Rumi used to being around people only to abandon her again.

After the cold and dreary months of winter, I am always eager for spring and to decorate for the Easter season. For me, celebrating Easter and the joys of spring go hand in hand.      Once you make the decision to set a formal or informal table, then the fun can begin. We've become a disposable society where paper plates, cups and napkins are the norm for family gatherings. Consider using the opportunity to take out the fine china, crystal and flatware. If you don't own fine china, but would like to start your own collection, visit estate sales or antique malls. While you're searching for these goodies, keep your eyes open for ceramic bunnies, chicks and lambs. Vintage tablecloths, napkins and candle holders are often found for great prices.      For a semi-formal place setting, I have often used wicker chargers. Dollar stores offer so many unique items to "fill in the gaps" on the table. Consider small vine bird's nests, tiny Easter eggs to fill small baskets at each place setting and holiday-themed salt and pepper shakers. Fresh flowers are always appropriate to herald the arrival of spring!      For fun and informal meals, vibrant Fiestaware plates always bring compliments from my guests. If you don't want to purchase an entire set of dishes, neighborhood yard sales and estate sales are your friends. The best part of using Fiestaware (besides its bright colors) is the ease of mixing and matching. I've used pink, purple, robin's egg blue, green, orange and yellow all together for an Easter egg color-themed table.      If room allows, have a separate "kids' table." Children love the bright colors and, again, the dollar stores are a treasure trove of goodies for setting the perfect table for your youngest guests. Vinyl tablecloths that can be easily cleaned are perfect for the inevitable spills and drips. Melamine plates are suitable for the kids, along with plastic cups or glasses. Consider filling a large basket with plastic Easter eggs as your centerpiece. If time allows before the meal, let the kids decorate their own boiled and dyed egg to use as their place setting marker.      Don't forget about the serving pieces. Silver trays, vintage egg plates for stuffed eggs, cabbage shaped bowls for coleslaw and platters with a carrot motif all contribute to the beauty of your Easter table. Plan ahead and visit your local hobby or department stores the days after Easter. You'll find great bargains for next spring's family table.
