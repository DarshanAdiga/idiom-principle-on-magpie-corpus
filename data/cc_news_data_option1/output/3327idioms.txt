Forewarned is forearmed, so here are a few thoughts on what some of the main themes might be. Bear in mind that these will not be your grandfather’s smears and swiftboat attacks. We need to expect that the “best” of these will be truly state-of-the-art national intelligence service disinformation, likely to feature credible-seeming “witnesses” or “victims” (paid-off or blackmailed, of course), absolutely believable deep-fake videos and photos, and a trove of very convincing looking forged documents.

Rather than recount every way in which _A Boy and His Dog_ differs from its source material (and there are many), at this juncture the final scene of the film must be discussed.55 After Vic and Quilla June return to the surface (which is identified as Phoenix, Arizona, in the film, thereby permitting Jones’s liberal use of western genre film motifs), they find Blood starving near the Topeka dropshaft. As in the novella and its graphic novel adaptation, Quilla June demands that Vic leave his starving friend: “If you love me, you’ll go!” Fade out. As the light of dawn breaks through the clouds, we see the smoking remains of a spit. Vic and Blood walk off into the horizon, leaving a smoldering campfire behind them. Quilla June’s wedding gown has been used to dress Blood’s injuries. This visual is effective, and Jones could have ended at this point, but instead he resurrects the lines he wrote in his previous draft; this time, however, the effect is not saccharine, but rather horrific. As they walk further away into the sunset, we hear Vic ask Blood if he’s had enough to eat. Blood replies that Vic might have to cook up more if they walk the whole day. Vic, rationalizing his actions, says, “Oh, Hell, it wasn’t my fault she picked me to get all wet-brained over.” Blood, trailing behind as the shot freezes, responds, “Well, I’d say she had marvelous judgment, Albert, if not [laughter] particularly good taste!” Both Blood and Vic begin giggling and laughing as Tim McIntire’s upbeat guitar and piano music (which sounds similar to John Prine or Leon Redbone) fades in and the credits roll.

At the end of the day, though, customers really just love getting a great deal. Signing up for a business’s text message marketing is the best way to get exclusive coupon codes that aren’t available to anyone else. In fact, the vast majority of customers that sign up for any business’s text messages cite that coupons and discounts were the primary reason that they opted in in the first place. This is especially true when the sales offered are flash sales or sales only available to, say, the first 100 people in the store.

“Exree Loe had a pick that ended a two-minute end of game situation. I have been impressed with him — he has shown improvement. He has gotten his weight up where it needs to be. He has been one of our best special teams players for the last two years. Akheem Mesidor continues to show he is ready to go, and he will be in our rotation when we start off Sept. 12.
 “Naim Muhammad played some special teams last year, and he had maybe the play of the day on a pick in the red zone. Taurus Simmons had a sack and was very active. His best football is down the road but he showed out today. And Dylan Tonkery is fitting the run better. He’s more comfortable.”
 Offensively, a mix of familiar and new names made Brown’s A-list.
 “Leddie Brown was really good today. For us to improve offensively he has to be a guy that is consistent for us. I thought he was patient today and finished runs. He made guys miss and broke tackles, which has been a point of emphasis.
 “Bryce Ford-Wheaton has had really good days except for one. He has talent, he has the size, he has the speed, he just needs to put it together. He had some big plays today and went for 100 yards. I think it’s just growth by him. He handled the pandemic pretty well. I’m not sure the confidence was always there. He had the game winner against Kansas State, and he made some other nice plays, and you started seeing signs of him getting confident. You can see that continuing to happen in camp this year. He has made plays, and you can see him gaining confidence. I’m not surprised, I knew it was going to happen, I just didn’t know when.”
 “Reese Smith had his best day as a Mountaineer. He had five catches today, I think, and several of those were on third down. And then Graeson (Malashevich), he competes. I love the way he plays. He’s one of our best perimeter blockers. He has a future here.”
 On special teams, Evan Staley might be edging ahead in the placekicking competition.
 “Outside of one day, he’s had a nice fall camp to this point, and (Dante) Bonamico keeps showing up.”
 While Brown is enthusiastic about the early showing of freshman quarterback Garrett Greene, he said the race for the starting spot against Eastern Kentucky is still a two-man race between Jarret Doege and Austin Kendall — for now. He doesn’t rule out the possibility of Greene making it a more crowded field in the future.
 “It’s probably too early to say, but I am fired up about Garrett Greene. I like the way he plays and the way he carries himself. The way he competes is special. You know about future bets — he’s a guy you take a future bet on. As far as who is going to start the opener, it’s a two-man race for now. Could he be a factor if he continues to grow? Yes.”
 While the NCAA’s ruling to give all current players in fall sports an extra year of eligibility will cause more roster planning down the road, Brown notes that is does have some impact for this year.
 “Now they don’t have to worry about the eligibility piece,” he said of his players and their peace of mind. “There are some roster things we will have to figure out, but that’s for another day. For right now this frees them up to play. For this season, it makes more guys available to you, probably on special teams, and now you aren’t worried about which four games you are going to play in. There’s a lot of strategy (in a regular year) of when you are going to play your four games.
 “Take Sean Martin, for example. He’s a guy that if we had normal rules, we probably would have redshirted him and been choosy about where he would play his four games. Now we can play him and bring him along, and by the end of the year he will be a solid contributor for us, and we don’t have to worry about that four game limit.”

The Swadeshi Jagran Manch, for the second time in less than 15 days, has demanded a complete ban on Glyphosate, which it holds largely responsible for causing cancer. The RSS backed body cited findings of pesticide expert Chuck Benbrook to reiterate that demand on Saturday. Benbrook claims that the wide usage of Glyphosate has even contaminated dust particles that one breathes. SJM's Ashwani Mahajan urged Agriculture and farmer welfare minister Narendra Singh Tomar to impose a complete ban on it.      "Right now Cancer cases are now on the rise across india. In the US, companies that used Glyphosate had to face legal consequences and settle matters at hundreds of millions of dollars. Next, I will write to the Prime Minister about it, if our demands are not met with," Mahajan told IANS. This is the second time in the last 15 days alone that the Singh backed organization has championed the cause. Earlier on August 7, the SJM had urged Tomar's ministry to withdraw its notification on a restricted use of the herbicide.      There are already more than 1 lakh 93 thousands signatories who have signed a petition drafted by Mahajan and addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, demanding the same.      Mahajan blamed it on the 'corporate greed" which allows glyphosate to contaminate the soil and water and cause Cancer. However, he added, it is incumbent upon the government to act, if the companies fail to self restrict.

The Paris Accord on Global Warming, repudiated by the Trump administration shortly after it took power, though long on promise and short on real solutions, was nevertheless a highly visible step in the right direction. Now ask a very practical question: What are the chances that the United States’ withdrawal from even that largely symbolic international accord makes the world more promotive of our well-being? Manifestly nil. And going further, is there any doubt that the answer to that question matters? No. It’s just one of the reasons that America’s leadership role among nations is in serious jeopardy.

The U.S. has the highest per capita CO2 emission rate in the world.

The NSW premier is confident in the processes in place at the state's quarantine hotels after two security guards tested positive to COVID-19.
 Of the four new COVID-19 cases confirmed on Sunday, one is a hotel security guard who was previously reported as a case on Saturday.
 He worked at the Marriott Hotel in Sydney and tested positive after a week- long testing blitz on contacts after another security guard tested positive on August 14.
 NSW Health on Sunday said contact tracing is underway as they investigate the source of his infection and potential links to the other infected security guard.
 Premier Gladys Berejiklian said a recent audit of the state's hotel quarantine system gave her confidence the processes in place are good.
 But, she noted mistakes will be made.
 "You might have good processes but that doesn't mean people remember to do the right thing all of the time," she told reporters on Sunday.
 "When the first guard tested positive of course it was a concern but it's also surprising it had not occurred until now given we've had 48,000 people come through that system."
 Ms Berejiklian also flagged she won't be increasing the cap on international arrivals into NSW at this stage.
 "We are still having the burden for the nation in terms of people we are welcoming and I don't want to see those numbers go up at this stage," she said.
 The newly-diagnosed security guard is the sole person among the first ill guard's 700 contacts to return a COVID-positive test.
 NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said the two guards worked the same shift on August 3, while the newly-diagnosed guard also worked at Sheraton Grand Hyatt Park hotel on the night of August 16.
 He was asymptomatic at the time of his shifts.
 The guard who originally tested positive also worked across a number of venues after he was exposed.
 The premier noted the state continues to be on a knife-edge in terms of community transmission and that she is most concerned about cases with no known source.
 She also reiterated to HSC students that Year 12 formals and graduation ceremonies could go ahead in term four after the exams.
 It follows an announcement earlier in the week to ban the events with Ms Berejiklian on Sunday saying the health advice is only in place until the end of HSC exams.
 "We don't want to risk the HSC getting disrupted," she said.
 "We're hoping in term four all of those activities can be conducted in a COVID safe way."
 NSW Labor health spokesman Ryan Park says the coalition government needs to learn from Victoria's mistakes in relation to quarantine hotels.
 The opposition wants hotel guards to be given full-time positions within the quarantine system, to help contain the virus should more guards be exposed.
 "Securing our quarantine hotels shouldn't be a part-time job," he said in a statement.
 Labor is also pushing for guards to be subject to testing, like the police.
 The other cases reported on Sunday included two travellers in hotel quarantine and one linked to the Apollo Restaurant cluster in Potts Point.

Nope. I'm not comparing you or any other business owner to a gangster. Absolutely not. But I will highlight one aspect of his personality.
 Bugsy Siegel saw a casino in the middle of the desert. He was a visionary. People thought he was wackadoodle, but then they didn't when the Flamingo was built and Sinatra began headlining. From tumbleweeds to today, the iconic Las Vegas Strip spans over four miles. An acre of land costs about four million dollars, and for trivia buffs, at its 2007 peak, an acre was $40 million. Bugsy landed an idea in the 3-D world that changed history, that's pretty visionary, point being, you and everyone else are, too, in varying degrees. Some use their prowess to imagine a Nitro Cold Brew. Boom. Done. Others expand perception to envision a casino, a woman on Mars, or a multibillion-dollar empire. So, let's look at two, of several, fundamental tenets of a visionary. Then decide for yourself what you and ole Bugs have in common.
 1\. Vision architect. Like an architect, seeing the vision in your mind's eye is step one. Of course, there's a lot more that happens after the vision but imagination is primo. It's a shame it took a back seat to logic because logic is basically the implementation arm for imagination, which by the way is thinking in pictures. The "picture" acts like an architectural blueprint for the conscious and subconscious mind to concretize the vision. What logical action steps would even be necessary without first a vision? Own your vision. Smell it. Taste it. See it. Feel it. If you run into a snag, consider Bugsy and the architect who'll refine the picture literally, metaphorically and imaginatively until it materializes. It's what a visionary does.
 2\. Energetic commitment. Having a vision is one thing, commitment to the vision, no matter what, is another. I'm not talking about bull-dog commitment, force can have a reverse effect. What I mean is this. There's a corresponding feeling when you imagine your vision. That feeling is energy. Committing to that vision-energy in spite of difficulties melts obstacles like the sun on an ice cube. As for the opinions of others, consider them. Remember though, most will innocently impose their limits upon you just like they did to Bugsy. The visionary journey has its highs and lows. At times you'll feel like you're floating untethered. But belief is the mindset that materializes your vision. In your alone time, live the energy of the vision. It's essential.
 So, you have zero interest in building a casino in the middle of a desert but as a business owner I'd bet you're unswervingly committed to your particular vision. Like Bugsy's, it could change the course of history. But maybe the only thing you have in common with Bugs is that you refine your vision and stay committed to it when the chips are down and against all odds. And most would say, that's a sure bet.

The red zone is identified as core-based statistical areas, known as CBSAs, and counties, that during the last week reported new cases above 100 per 100,000 population and a viral lab test positivity rate 10%, data in the report states.
 "The White House Coronavirus Task Force issues weekly reports to governors about the current state of the COVID-19 pandemic, but doesn't make those reports public, keeping county-level data and advice to states out of sight," the Center of Public Integrity report states, adding that the nonprofit is gathering weekly reports for all 50 states.
 McAlester Mayor John Browne said he saw the report Friday.
 "At this time we are not looking at putting any additional restrictions on," Browne said.
 He said Gov. Kevin Stitt has committed to releasing the weekly reports from the White House and Browne said the city will continue to monitor reports from the Oklahoma State Department of Health — which as of Friday, had Pittsburg County ranked below the red zone, in the orange zone.
 "We will continue to monitor the report and the number of cases and deaths, Browne said.

Deemed essential workers during the pandemic, The Inquirer staff has worked at full tilt throughout the coronavirus shutdown and reopening. The stay-at-home order put our business and all local businesses in financial turmoil. Our local advertising revenue sources had to shut their doors and yet, we still had to print the weekly newspaper and operate our digital news site. So we partnered with the COVID-19 Local News Fund, which was launched in April to support independent news organizations hit by the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Through the Local Media Association, a 501(c)(3) foundation, we’ve raised over $36,000 in tax-deductible donations from more than 270 donors. We asked and you responded generously, and many of you wrote heartfelt notes of encouragement. For this, we’re profoundly thankful.
 But our economic pain continues. Many of our local businesses and organizations are suffering their own financial hardships and have pulled back their advertising significantly. And there are others who, somewhat by a stroke of luck, are doing so well that they don’t think they need to advertise in their local newspaper.
 What’s not going to continue though, is the ability to make tax-deductible contributions to us. The COVID-19 Local Media Fund will be shutting down on Thursday, Aug. 27. So if you’ve been thinking about making a tax-deductible donation to The Inquirer — or would like to give again — you need to do so quickly.

Again, Biden’s website provides proof of intent, stating that “the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face.”

Finally, let me say that it may seem reasonable to consider a new effort to address problems associated with climate change, even as a pandemic rages, as quixotic. The burden of bringing climate change under sustainable control falls to us who are alive now on the only planet we have, because the lion’s share of damage has occurred on our watch. On the other hand, who says it’s impossible to deal with more than one problem at a time? We certainly did so during World War II. We continue with highway construction, with the nation’s political life, and with all manner of effort to make money to keep our individual boats afloat. Global warming and its attendant problems are arguably the most proximate threats to all life the world faces, and time is our enemy. When confronted with increasingly stark choices, it’s evident there is no time like the present. So kudos to Ken Griffin and Scott Padgett for keeping their eyes on the ball. Someone has to.

The whole Nation was held back. No more campaigning on policy. Rather than working on solving our problems, the national discourse was limited to beliefs and opinions, simple arsed answers, and conspiracy theories. Discourse only when beliefs and opinions were given more weight than facts; than scientific expertise. In consequence of politicians bestowing their blessing on those beliefs and opinions in exchange for the holders' votes; we are, to date, incapable of dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Though in great part due to a lack of leadership, itself a consequence of the Southern Strategy, this is in great part also to do with large portions of the citizenry who do not believe in science, in the facts. Control of the COVID-19 pandemic is not possible as long as individual states refuse to follow the advice of scientific experts. How in the hell could any Governor of a State in the United States of America in the 21st Century go against the best scientific advice? What did they expect would happen? This is a consequence of Republican politicians making all those pilgrimages to Liberty University, Bob Jones University, Oral Roberts University, …; giving credence to anti-scientific, anti-intellectual beliefs; pandering to, according power to, right-wing Evangelical Christian sects in order to win their votes. We should have become more enlightened in these 50+ years that have passed by since Republicans initiated their Southern Strategy. Instead, we have been held back by southern Republican Politicians and Christian Right/Evangelical Christians. In tandem with the Republican Party, they have taken the Nation backward. I think that was William and Clarence that I just saw walking toward that old courthouse.

The national COVID-19 death toll has topped 500, with many new fatalities again coming from the aged care sector in virus-hit Victoria.
 A further 11 deaths in Victorian aged care facilities were reported on Sunday out of a total of 17.
 It takes the state's toll to 415 and the national total to 502.
 Federal Labor on Monday will keep the heat on the Morrison government over its handling of the aged care sector during the coronavirus pandemic when parliament sits for the first time for 10 weeks.
 Opposition health spokesman Chris Bowen says the number of deaths in aged care homes during the crisis has been heartbreaking.
 "At every test for the federal government they've failed when it comes to aged care," Mr Bowen told Sky News' Sunday Agenda program.
 "It's a clear federal government responsibility.There's no shared responsibility for aged care despite Scott Morrison's spin - it's their job."
 Defending the government's approach to the crisis, Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said aged care was a vulnerable sector in the pandemic.
 "If you have got a jurisdiction like Victoria where there is a massive outbreak ... the aged care sector inevitably is particularly exposed," Senator Cormann told reporters on Sunday.
 He said the government had put more than $1 billion in place to support the sector during the pandemic.
 "But in the end, in the face of this sort of pandemic, there is a practical limit to how effective that sadly can be in the context of a virus like this," Senator Cormann said.
 Victoria also reported 208 new infections on Sunday, the first time above the 200 mark in three days.
 Victorian chief health officer Brett Sutton said although the daily case numbers were "jumping around", he expected they were on a downward trajectory.
 "We're not going to see 300 and 400 again (cases) in Victoria under my watch at least," he told reporters on Sunday.
 NSW recorded four new cases, including a hotel security guard who worked at Sydney's Marriott Hotel.
 NSW Health on Sunday said contact tracing was underway as they investigated the source of his infection and potential links to the other infected security guards.
 Queensland recorded just two new cases that were linked to the Brisbane Youth Detention Centre, with a total of nine cases now associated with that cluster after a worker was diagnosed with the virus on Wednesday.
 "The results overnight are encouraging but of course we're not out of the woods yet," Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk told reporters.
 Western Australia recorded one new case, an interstate traveller who had returned from overseas and tested positive while in hotel quarantine.

Authorities are confident Victoria's second wave of COVID-19 is on a downward trajectory as the state's chief health officer insists daily case numbers of up to 400 won't happen again on his watch.
 Victoria on Sunday recorded 17 more COVID-19 deaths with 11 linked to aged care outbreaks and 208 new cases.
 The national death toll is now 502 while state fatalities have reached 415.
 Premier Daniel Andrews noted metropolitan Melbourne was halfway through its stage four restrictions while regional Victoria was at the halfway mark of its stage three protocols.
 He said the next few weeks would be challenging but urged people suffering lockdown fatigue to "stay the course".
 "If we let our fatigue get the better of us the only victor is the virus because it will spread more easily," he told reporters on Sunday.
 "The strategy is working. We can be rightfully hopeful about what the next phase will be but we just have to get there.
 "This is a very stubborn thing and it won't go away easily."
 Mr Andrews said the weekend's bad weather was an "absolute blessing" and hoped it meant more people stayed at home.
 He also flagged it was too early to predict if the Melbourne Cup would go ahead or what Christmas this year would look like.
 The premier also confirmed he would contest the state election in 2022, saying there was a lot more that needed to be done.
 His comment followed speculation he might step down after the pandemic was over.
 Chief health officer Brett Sutton said although the daily case numbers were "jumping around", he expected they were on a downward trajectory.
 The state on Saturday recorded a second consecutive day of fresh coronavirus cases below 200, prompting Professor Sutton to predict numbers could dip below 150 next week even though Sunday's outcome was 208.
 "We're not going to see 300 and 400 (cases) again in Victoria under my watch, at least," he told reporters on Sunday.
 "We're applying a strategy that is driving cases down."
 He said restrictions would not be lifted in full until community transmission was eradicated.
 It comes as the Melbourne set of The Masked Singer was shut down because several crew members tested positive for coronavirus.
 "The entire production team, including the masked singers, the host and panellists are now in self-isolation," the Network Ten program posted on Twitter late on Saturday night.
 The reality show hosted by Osher Gunsberg involves masked celebrities competing against each other in a singing competition.
 The panellists include Dannii Minogue and comedian Dave Hughes.
 Prof Sutton said a "number of staff" had tested positive but insisted it did not necessarily mean there had been a breach of any guidelines.
 Melbourne residents still have about another three weeks of stage four restrictions, including an overnight curfew, ahead of them before they are revised on September 13.
 Regional Victorians are under slightly less onerous level three restrictions for the same period.
 Prof Sutton said people must expect to continue wearing protective masks long after stage four restrictions ease in metropolitan Melbourne.
 There are 3920 COVID-19 cases with an unknown source in Victoria and 536 active cases in healthcare workers.
 Meanwhile, hearings for state's inquiry into the failed hotel quarantine program resume on Monday with more testimony from hotel security staff.
 The inquiry last week heard poor-performing security guards were moved between the quarantine hotels, while returned travellers feared catching the coronavirus during their stay.

At the time Lawrence was very much regarded as a one-club man but he was an astute appointment.
 He had been in charge of Charlton Athletic for nine years, having earned the nickname Houdini for winning promotion and keeping the Addicks in the top flight for four seasons, usually with last gasp escape acts.
 Lennie had operated on a shoestring throughout his time at Charlton. Therefore he was perfectly suited to joining a club like Boro which was still building financial foundations.
 Even so, Boro rolled out the chequebook for Lawrence and what money he spent, he spent well.
 The big swoop was a double deal with Watford for their duo Willie Falconer and Paul Wilkinson.
 Falconer was a tough Scottish midfielder, who also scored a few goals, and joined Boro from the Hornets at the same time as fellow midfield man Trevor Putney moved in the opposite direction.
 Wilkinson, who had won a League Championship winner's medal while with Everton, was a strong attack leader who had a good eye for goal.
 Arguably Lawrence’s biggest “signing” that summer was in convincing want-away Alan Kernaghan to stay on at the club.
 The future Irish international had felt surplus to requirements at the Boro and, following a successful loan spell with Lawrence’s Charlton, was all set to complete a switch to the Addicks.
 Nobody was more surprised that Kernaghan to see Lawrence turn up at Ayresome. It took all of Lawrence’s power of persuasion to get the player to agree to stay on.
 Lawrence’s man management was one of his key strengths. He was not a typical football man, having worked as a teacher before moving into football on a full-time basis.
 He was a great thinker about the game. His abilities in this area have led to him retaining advisory posts with clubs up until this very day.
 Lennie managed to clear muddled heads in the dressing room during the summer of 1991. The new-look Boro came out with a positive approach in a bid to step up on the previous season’s play offs appearances.
 The team suffered a couple of early hiccups, but then hit top gear by winning seven and drawing one of eight consecutive games.
 It left Boro among promotion pacesetters which was where they were to stay for the remainder of the campaign.

 Another unusual case came when a Pauls Valley man who had minutes earlier broken into a local residence was found naked from the waist down.
 Local police believe Richie Richardson, 45, was under the influence of some type of illegal drug when he broke into a South McClure residence during the morning of Aug. 14.
 The report of an intruder led police to Richardson as walked into a nearby field. He claimed to have no memory of why he was half dressed and how he got to the site.
 Officers report Richardson was holding pornographic DVDs as he continued to claim he was unaware of what he was doing and what had happened.
 Two women at the residence, a grandmother and her granddaughter, both made 911 calls after one of them found Richardson crawling outside her bedroom door.
 When she started screaming about what he wanted or who he was the woman said Richardson never answered while just remaining still, “staring through” her.
 Officers later found the damage where Richardson had forced his way in through a back door. They also saw broken glass from a pipe used to smoke methamphetamine, along with a sex toy and lubricants where Richardson had been in the house.

When Donald Trump promised to bring back king coal in West Virginia, he was speaking not to coal miners but to the grandsons and granddaughters of coal miners nostalgic for halcyon ( _Matewan, Harlan County_ ) days that never were while thinking about the price of coal, preservation of wealth, and campaign donations from the mine owners. Truth be, he wanted their vote; didn't care about the environment; was far too lazy to think it through; couldn't have cared less about the miners 'long lost' jobs. Long lost, indeed. In 2016, coal mines employed 50K miners, about the same as in 1970 – 50 years earlier. During that period, production was up almost 300%. The 50K employed was down from an all-time peak of 863K in 1923. In the period from 1923 to 1970, production was up about 25%. Automation happened. The jobs were gone and they ain't coming back ( _Thanks, Hazel Dickens_ ). Today, coal mining in West Virginia provides less than 5% of the State's jobs. In 2016, Trump carried the State by a 40% margin. By the bye, Trump who purloined 'Make America Great Again' from Reagan, and 'Law and Order' from Nixon; won all the Ex-Confederate States except Virginia and, no doubt, all the votes of any surviving George Wallace supporters. Trump out Wallaced Wallace. Brought it all forward, he did, and added Reality TV and Professional Wrestling for the Con of it. Sought and received help from Russia for good measure. A platform to build a dream on. An estimated 83% of white Evangelicals voted for Trump in 2016. 51 years after the Civil Rights Legislation was passed, the Republican Party had found its bottom.

 # Des Moines County 99 to begin construction on water line replacement. Asks citizens to limit unnecessary water use.
 The Hawk Eye
 The Burlington Municipal Waterworks will begin replacement of one of the two 30 inch water mains Monday that deliver drinking water and fire protection to City of Burlington, Des Moines County and reaching into a couple of the surrounding counties.
 Construction should last about 6 weeks.
 Burlington Waterworks seeks cooperation from the public to limit unnecessary water usage due to the limited flow capacity during this construction. High temperatures are expected for the foreseeable future and it is important to be able to meet the needs for general drinking and household water needs along with water for fire protection.

Following the success of his novella, Ellison began receiving bids for a film version. His first offer came from producers at Universal Studios, who offered Ellison a sum of money “in the very, very high six figures.”32 However, they also wanted to animate Blood’s mouth to indicate when he was “speaking,” a la Mr. Ed, so Ellison refused the offer, as he did with two or three other studios. L. Q. Jones, who up to that point had been most famous as one of Sam Peckinpah’s character actors, convinced Ellison that he could direct and produce the film, and so the rights were sold, inexpensively, and Ellison began working on the screenplay. However, after writing the first nine pages or so, Ellison hit a writer’s block and handed the script to Jones for completion.33 Jones wrote the script in a year, and in 1974 the film went into production on a shoestring budget; Ellison had no hand in Jones’s script and was never present during production, although he did participate in post- production to eliminate scenes that annoyed him. Before we examine a certain scene in the final cut and the reactions it provoked, a little-known early draft of _A Boy and His Dog_ , entitled _Rover Blood_ , warrants attention, as it demonstrates how radically different Ellison’s novella could have become after it left his hands.
