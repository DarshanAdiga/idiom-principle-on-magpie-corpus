The only option left - and one not yet seriously considered by the Trump administration - is to fall back on cooperation with other great powers, not least with Washington's many allies, such as the U.K., France and Germany, who are still anxious for American global leadership.

 A storm system will soak the northeastern United States and bring another dose of winter weather that will bring accumulating snow to parts of the region.
 _For the latest on the storm and a complete local forecast, check out our media partner WCVB._
 The first half and last half of this dynamic storm will be like night and day in terms of weather and precipitation type for many locations.
 Precipitation will begin as rainfall with mild conditions entrenched across much of the Northeast.
 The second half of the storm will be the colder and wintry part and responsible for some snow away from the coastal mid-Atlantic and southeastern New England.
 It's possible that precipitation may hold off until the storm is ready to bring all snow to northern New England later this weekend, according to AccuWeather meteorologists.
 There is likely to be little if any accumulating snowfall from Washington, D.C., to New York City and Boston, but the northern part of this swath is likely to at least have some snow mixing in at the end of the storm during Saturday night and Sunday.
 Because the storm is now expected to remain weak and move at a rapid pace, there is less of a chance that accumulating snow occurs on non-paved surfaces in the northern suburbs of New York City. However, that potential still exists to the north and west of Boston.
 \"How much snow accumulates will depend on how quickly colder air sweeps in and causes rain to become mixed with and change to snow,\" AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Brett Anderson said.
 Roads and the lowest part of the atmosphere will be warm until cold air catches up during the latter part of the storm, and the lingering mild conditions can be a limiting factor in the amount of snowfall accumulation.
 Around Washington, D.C., the storm is expected to only bring plain rain. However, around Boston, it may snow at a steady, heavy rate for a few hours and increase the chance of some snow sticking to the roads. A few inches may accumulate on roadways well to the north and west of Boston.
 Meanwhile, over the Appalachians, a change from rain to snow is highly likely, and it will occur from southwest to northeast. This changeover to snow will occur during the day Saturday and then continue Saturday night over the mountains in Tennessee, western North Carolina, West Virginia, northwestern Virginia, western Maryland and western Pennsylvania.
 Accumulating snow is also possible in the mountains of north-central and northeastern Pennsylvania and is highly likely in western, central and northern New York and New England during Saturday night and Sunday.
 A general coating to 3 inches of snow is likely over the central and southern Appalachians. Heavier snow is likely at elevations above 1,800 feet over the West Virginia, western Maryland and south-central Pennsylvania mountains.
 Snowfall of 3-6 inches is likely with an AccuWeather Local StormMax™ of 8 inches from western and northern New York to western Maine.
 Rain is likely to just end over southeastern Virginia Saturday night.
 Enough chilly air will stick around the Northeast to allow for additional rounds of wintry precipitation into next week, but true Arctic air will not follow the storm.
 One weak storm is likely to spread flurries and perhaps a snow squall from Sunday night to Monday near and north of Interstate 80 before a larger storm has the potential to bring more snow or rain changing to snow to the Northeast from Tuesday night to Wednesday.
 Even though true Arctic air will not follow the storm during the middle of next week, strong winds could squeeze out every ounce of frigid conditions in terms of how it feels. AccuWeather RealFeel® Temperatures are likely to plunge into the teens, single digits and below zero degrees Fahrenheit in the region from Wednesday to Thursday.

CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (WRAL/CNN) - NASA had its first blood clot case in space. There was no protocol, so they contacted a University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill doctor for his expertise."So I picked up the phone and NASA was on the phone and said it was urgent,” said Dr. Stephan Moll.As a kid, Moll wanted to be an astronaut, so he was a little moon-eyed."It was surprising. It was an honor. I was curious to see where that would lead,” he said.It would lead to the International Space Station, where an astronaut had a blood clot.Moll is a star when it comes to his blood clot expertise, having been published in medical journals.For privacy reasons, the astronaut was not identified, but the clot was found in the jugular vein.This was the first blood clot case in space, and NASA had no protocol.“All the decisions that had to be made were best guesses,” said Moll.The doctor couldn’t help but ask if NASA would send him to the station to examine the patient himself.“So I should really be taken up there,” he said, fishing for an invite. “And their response was, we’ll see what we can do and we’ll get back to you.”Moll remained earthbound while consulting a team of NASA doctors. If the clot weren't treated, it could spread to the lungs or brain and become far more serious.The typical treatment on earth is blood thinners, but how would they work in zero gravity?“I needed to weigh the risk-benefit of starting a blood thinner or not using a blood thinner,” Moll said.He and the team agreed to put the astronaut on blood thinners with Moll directing the dosage. The space station had only a limited supply, but the treatment worked.Moll even had a phone call from his patient."My wife picked up and it was the International Space Station, and she handed the phone to me and saying there is someone from outer space who wants to talk to you,” said Dr. Moll.It was enough to make a well-grounded doctor feel on top of the world.The astronaut is now back here on Earth and is doing well.Copyright 2020 WRAL via CNN.

WASHINGTON -- Democratic presidential contenders on Friday condemned the air strike that killed Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani, saying President Donald Trump's decision was reckless and could lead the United States to another war in the Middle East.
 "President Trump just tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox," said former Vice President Joe Biden. His campaign released a 30-second online ad that portrayed Biden as "tested and trusted around the world" against Trump's "erratic, unstable" presidency.
 "We're on the brink of yet another war in the Middle East," said liberal U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren. "We're not here by accident. We're here because a reckless president, his allies and his administration have spent years pushing us here."
 The overnight killing of Soleimani, regarded as the second most powerful figure in Iran, was a dramatic escalation of hostilities in the Middle East between Iran and the United States and its allies.
 A protracted conflict could reshape an election that has so far been dominated by domestic issues, such as healthcare and money in politics, strategists said. While that could be a plus for the leading Democratic candidates such as Biden, who has stressed his foreign policy experience and credentials, lesser- known contenders could have a harder time being heard.
 "The ultimate beneficiary in the Democratic race could be the four candidates in front," said Democratic strategist Steve Elmendorf, referring to Biden, Warren, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana.
 "Nobody behind them will have a chance to reset the race or change things," said Elmendorf, a Buttigieg supporter who served as chief of staff for former House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt.
 The Democratic contenders are set to face voters for the first time in a month, when Iowa kicks off the state-by-state nominating battle on Feb. 3.
 Public opinion polls show Americans in general are opposed to U.S. military interventions overseas. A survey last year by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs found only 27% of Americans believe military interventions make the United States safer, and nearly half said they make the country less safe.
 "There are serious questions about how this decision was made and whether we are prepared for the consequences," said Buttigieg, a former Navy Reserve officer who served in Afghanistan.
 Trump said the strike aimed to disrupt "imminent and sinister attacks" on Americans. His fellow Republicans praised the president for restoring American strength and leadership.
 "At a time when the president is under impeachment by the Democrats, there's nothing wrong with him showing strength and resolve in the face of a foreign threat," said Republican strategist Ron Bonjean, who is close to the White House.
 While the Democrats were united in condemning Trump's decision, there were some distinctions in their responses. Biden and Buttigieg indicated they viewed Soleimani as a security threat who had sowed chaos in the region, whereas Sanders and Warren referred to him more neutrally and called his killing an "assassination."
 Sanders, who has consistently opposed U.S. military intervention overseas, contrasted the strike with his own domestic priorities of universal healthcare, improved infrastructure and steps to combat climate change.
 "We must invest in the needs of the American people, not spend trillions more on endless wars," Sanders said at a campaign event in Anamosa, Iowa.
 Sanders also mentioned his 2002 vote against authorizing war in Iraq, which he frequently uses as a contrast to Biden, the former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who backed the war.
 Tulsi Gabbard, a House member and Army National Guard veteran of the Iraq war who also has opposed U.S. military interventions, said the strike showed "we need to get out of Iraq and Syria now."
 "That is the only way that we're going to prevent ourselves from being dragged into this quagmire, deeper and deeper into a war with Iran," she wrote on Twitter, using the hashtag #WWIII. (Additional reporting by Steve Holland; Editing by Steve Orlofsky and Jonathan Oatis)

With five flights of two dozen Napa Valley Cabernet Franc wines available for the St. Helena Star/Napa Valley Vintners Tasting Panel to assess last month, it was clear that Cabernet Franc is a phenomenon worth attention.
 During the panel discussion, John Skupny, who has been making Cabernet Franc for 26 years under his Lang & Reed label, said, “With the scope of this tasting, it is exciting to see Cabernet Franc become a lead player in the Napa Valley. It is a wine that expresses its own complexities and unique characteristics.”
 Robin Baggett, owner of Alpha Omega Winery, said, “It’s more than a blending wine,” explaining that he makes a Cabernet Franc for which some of his clients are willing to pay top dollar.
 Michael Martin, general manager of Market Restaurant in St. Helena, agreed, saying, “People who like Cabernet Franc and like to geek out [about wine] are willing to pay the price for it. It has a cult following.”
 Alan Viader of Viader Vineyards & Winery, whose family makes a Cabernet Franc under the DARE label, commented, “When it’s done right, it pairs better with food; it’s a little softer” than Cabernet Sauvignon. Alan then discussed the holy grail of Cabernet Franc: its aromatics, spices and a peppery quality. He concluded, “It’s incredible when planted in the right places, and if you don’t over-extract [it] to keep its elegance.”
 Karen Cakebread of Ziata Wines also commented on the wine’s affinity with food, calling Cabernet Franc “a companion on the table with food.”
 The samples tasted by panelists included both 100% and Cabernet Franc- dominated wines.
 Valued for its aromatics and the bright lift it adds to Cabernet Sauvignon in particular, Cabernet Franc is prized in Napa Valley’s sought-after red blends. The grape, however, stands well on its own, with 100% varietal wines showing good tannins for aging; a richly intense color; bright acidity; and a range of red to black fruit flavors, fresh and dried herbs, a touch of violet floral, and toast or sweet baking spices from oak.
 The descriptors may sound similar to many Cabernet Sauvignon wines in the Napa Valley, and that would not be overly surprising given that Cabernet Franc is a parent vine to Cabernet Sauvignon, but the former’s particular virtue is in those beautifully vibrant aromatics.

The New Orleans Saints and the Minnesota Vikings are very familiar with one another.
 When the Saints host the Vikings in an NFL wild-card game Sunday afternoon, it will be the fifth time they have met in the postseason. Minnesota will break a tie with Philadelphia as New Orleans' most frequent playoff opponent.
 "It feels like we've played a handful of games," Saints coach Sean Payton said Wednesday.
 The Saints and Vikings met three times in a stretch of 25 games during the 2017 and 2018 seasons, which included the Vikings' "Minneapolis Miracle" victory in the divisional round after the 2017 season.
 Minnesota won a home game in the 2017 regular season, and New Orleans won a road game in the 2018 season. The teams even met in their 2019 preseason opener back in August.
 Of course the game that stands out most was that 2017 playoff meeting in Minneapolis, in which New Orleans rallied from a 17-0 halftime deficit to take a 24-23 lead with 25 seconds left.
 The Saints seemingly were on their way to Philadelphia for the NFC Championship Game when Case Keenum completed a pass to Stefon Diggs, rookie safety Marcus Williams whiffed on an attempted tackle and Diggs sprinted to a 61-yard touchdown as time expired.
 Minnesota is 3-1 against New Orleans in the playoffs, starting with a 44-10 wild-card victory in the Superdome after the 1987 season in the Saints' first postseason appearance.
 New Orleans' only victory was pretty memorable also, as it prevailed 31-28 in overtime in the NFC Championship Game in the Superdome, en route to the Saints' only Super Bowl after the 2009 season.
 The Saints bounced back from the playoff loss at Minnesota two years ago to go 13-3 and claim the No. 1 seed in the NFC last season. They narrowly missed going to the Super Bowl in an overtime loss at home against the Rams in the NFC Championship Game.
 They almost certainly would have won that game if the officials had called a penalty on a blatant case by pass interference by the Rams late in the fourth quarter. New Orleans put that loss behind it and went 13-3 again this year.
 "I think it says a lot about our group to be able to take some of those unfortunate circumstances and be able to turn that into something positive and use that as fuel, use that as a way to bring us closer together and fight through that adversity to bring out the best in all of us," quarterback Drew Brees said.
 The Saints (13-3) were the first NFL team to qualify for the playoffs this season when they captured a third consecutive NFC South title on Thanksgiving night. They were in position to claim a first-round bye and perhaps the top seed in the NFC.
 But 10 days after clinching, they lost a 48-46 shootout to San Francisco, and both the 49ers and Green Bay won tiebreakers to claim the first-round byes. New Orleans wound up No. 3.
 Minnesota controlled its fate in the NFC North until losing at home to Green Bay in Week 16, as the Packers wrapped up the division title and the Vikings were locked in at No. 6.
 Coach Mike Zimmer rested several key players in the regular-season finale, and Minnesota lost to Chicago to finish 10-6.
 "I don't think anybody believes that we can win this game, so we go in there and we slug it out," said Zimmer, who is 2-2 against New Orleans, including playoffs. "All I really care about is that 53 guys believe.
 "It's important that when you get in games like this, number one, you have to be able to execute. Do what you've been doing all along."
 The Vikings will be bolstered by the return of Pro Bowl running back Dalvin Cook, who missed the last two games because of a shoulder injury.
 "I feel refreshed. I'm going to be ready to go," Cook said. "I'm going to be at full strength. Looking forward to a good football game."
 Cook has rushed for 1,135 yards and 13 touchdowns and caught 53 passes for 519 yards.
 Minnesota linebacker Eric Kendricks (quad) also will return after missing one game. Kendricks tied for the NFL lead among linebackers with 12 pass breakups during the regular season.
 The Vikings will be without cornerbacks Mike Hughes (neck) and Mackensie Alexander (knee). Hughes was placed on injured reserve on Friday.
 For the Saints, cornerback Eli Apple (ankle) and fullback Zach Line (knee) were ruled out Friday. Safety Vonn Bell (knee) returns after a three-game absence.

And Maureen captured the rising sun's rays reaching out over Cohasset Harbor and reflected on its calm waters. What a great way to welcome 2020!

Bryant leaves office when his second term ends Jan. 14. He tweeted Thursday that he will campaign for Hyde-Smith this year "as if the fate of America depended on her single election. If Mike Espy and the liberal Democrats gain the Senate we will take that first step into a thousand years of darkness."

Still, with the average card interest rate at about 17%, carrying a balance on a credit card is expensive. And many people probably added to their balances late in the year. The financial website MagnifyMoney found that just under half of consumers said they had taken on debt this holiday season — an average of $1,325, up 8% from last year — and most won’t be able to pay it off in January. (The online survey of 1,120 consumers was conducted just before Dec. 25.)
 “If you can pay it all off in January, then no problem,” said Dave O’Brien, head of the board of directors of the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors, a trade group for fee-only financial planners. If not, he said, make a plan to pay down the balances — by April, if you can swing it.
 “Make the monthly payments high enough that it hurts,” O’Brien said.
 Mark Wernig, principal at Dowling &amp; Yahnke Wealth Advisors in San Diego and a spokesman for the Certified Financial Planner Board, which oversees standards for financial planners, said he also recommended paying off holiday debt in the first 90 days of the new year. He suggested using a simple paper calendar. That allows people to mark off the dates for payments as well as visualize the goal of finishing by the end of the first quarter.
 “It needs to be confronted,” he said.
 After creating a list of your card balances and their interest rates, Wernig said, try calling the card companies to ask if they’ll lower your rate. They may be agreeable if you have a consistent payment history.
 People with good credit, he said, might also consider consolidating their card debt by taking out a lower-interest personal loan. Similarly, they may consider opening a new credit card with a zero or low introductory interest rate and transferring high-rate balances to the new card. Bear in mind, though, that most balance transfer cards charge a fee of at least 3% of the balance you are moving. And you’ll need to be disciplined, advisers said, to avoid adding new debt onto the old cards.
 Some credit cards, like American Express, offer the option of paying off part of a balance over time for a flat monthly fee, which may save you money and avoid the need to apply for a new credit card. (The option is called Pay It Plan It.)
 When you are ready to start paying off the debt, Wernig said, consider making payments biweekly, rather than monthly, to shrink the balance more quickly and reduce the interest paid.
 If a three-month time frame means the payments are unaffordable, consider a longer-term plan. Perhaps divide the total debt by 12 and pay it off, along with the added interest, over the coming year, said Scott Buttfield, a financial planner in Red Bank, New Jersey.
 Allen Purkiss, a financial planner in Ridgefield, Connecticut, said he occasionally saw clients who owned stock in their investment portfolios but were also carrying credit card debt. His advice to them is to sell some shares and pay down the card debt. No one knows what the market will do in the future, of course. But it may not be reasonable to expect recent double-digit market gains to continue, so using stock to get rid of high-interest card debt makes sense.
 “In the current environment,” he said, “it usually makes sense to lower equity exposure and lower debt.”
 Don’t have any stocks to sell? There are other options. Making extra cash by selling items you no longer need has become easier, with online options like eBay and local Facebook groups, said Cynthia Meyer, a financial planner in Gladstone, New Jersey. Focus on high-quality clothes or children’s toys in good condition, she said — and be realistic about how much people will pay for your used items.
 Scour your card statements for subscriptions and services you don’t really need, O’Brien said. If you have an emergency cash account, he said, it may make sense to use at least part of it to pay off the cards. Or perhaps you have a tax refund coming that can at least partly offset your debt.
