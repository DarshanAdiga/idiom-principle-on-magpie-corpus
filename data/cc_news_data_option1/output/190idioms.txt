The Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Act (總統副總統選舉罷免法) states that anyone who takes a mobile phone or other camera equipment into a polling station faces a sentence of up to one year in prison, or a fine of up to NT$30,000, the Keelung City Election Commission said.
 In Changhua County, it was reported that a person demanded a new ballot after he accidentally left an ink imprint on the ballot beneath the one he stamped.
 The ink pad on site was too wet, he said.
 A squabble ensued, as his request was rejected.
 The special review committee from the Changhua County Election Commission arrived and ruled that the man should be given a new ballot, making him the first person in the nation’s history to be given a second presidential ballot.
 Meanwhile, a longtime fugitive, wanted for a crime allegedly committed four years ago, was caught by police at a polling station in Kaohsiung yesterday.
 The fugitive was spotted when he arrived at the Juy Guang Elementary School to vote, said Tai Chuan-cheng (戴銓成), head of the Zuoying Precinct substation.
 The police officer who spotted the suspect chose to wait until the man had cast his vote before arresting him, Tai said.
 However, when the man was arrested he said that he was not aware that he had been listed as a wanted suspect and had been working odd jobs in several places outside Kaohsiung, Tai said.
 According to the National Police Agency, 49 breaches of electoral laws were reported yesterday, including 17 cases where a mobile phone or other camera equipment was brought to a polling station and 13 cases where ballots were destroyed.

Another session of the General Assembly is upon us. This is an election year and there will be more posturing under the Gold Dome than a prima ballerina in a performance of “Swan Lake.”
 One of the big issues will be how to deal with Gov. Brian Kemp’s call for the Legislature to cut 4% from many program budgets this fiscal year and 6% next year in case of an economic downturn. The cuts would amount to some $500 million.
 While they are at it, someone needs to take a hard look at Georgia’s much- ballyhooed film tax credit. A recently released state audit says what many have thought all along — the economic benefits have been grossly exaggerated, and it is costing We the Unwashed money.
 This may be new news to some, but not to Kennesaw State University economics professor J.C. Bradbury who produced a study last year entitled “The rapid widespread propagation of specious information regarding Georgia’s film industry.” That is economist-speak for saying that Hollywood’s numbers are as inflated as Sean Penn’s ego.
 Dr. Bradbury’s analysis posited that Georgia’s film industry contributes approximately $3 billion to Georgia’s $588 billion GDP, or approximately 0.5% or 1/200th of the state’s economy, a rather small part of our economy.
 I wrote about his study last August and got a lot of mail from readers around the state questioning the wisdom of giving away so much money to an industry group threatening to boycott the state after an anti-abortion bill was passed by the General Assembly and signed into law by Gov. Kemp.
 I am not a big movie fan — I think the last movie I saw was “Lassie Come Home,” starring, uh, Lassie — but I suspect the boycott talk is just so much Hollywood hooey. The film industry is not about to pass up the billions of dollars the state has been doling out to them.
 One response defending the program said I was totally wrong and that I had become “a grumpy old man” (I threatened to sue for libel until my lawyer told me to go look in the mirror and see if a grumpy old man was staring back at me) and that Dr. Bradbury was “clueless.”
 I wonder how he feels now about the state audit that says the economic benefits of the film credits have, in fact, been exaggerated and that the Department of Economic Development has used an inflated multiplier to pump up the numbers as Dr. Bradbury suggested in his report and that most of the wages from productions were paid to non-residents, including high-salaried, out-of- state talent.
 It seems the state currently spends more dollars doling out tax credits to the film industry than it spends on our court system, driver’s license services, Georgia State Patrol, housing juvenile offenders and criminal case investigations combined — services I think we would find more important to our quality of life than an episode of “The Walking Dead.”
 Auditors recommend the General Assembly cap how much money film projects can get from the tax credit. Currently there is no cap. The state audit found millions of dollars of ineligible expenses and inflated numbers by the film companies. And, according to the audit, about 80% of the credits are sold off by film companies that pay little or no taxes in Georgia to people or companies that do owe state taxes.
 The audit says, “The film tax credit results in significant revenue loss for the state by reducing income tax revenue that would have been paid otherwise. The lost revenue includes income taxes owed by tax credit purchasers on activity unrelated to film production.”
 Here is how it works: An entity owing the state $1 million in taxes could purchase that amount in tax credits from a film production company through an intermediary for around $900,000. The buyer purchasing the credits then submits the tax credits to the treasury rather than making a tax payment. Nice, eh?
 No doubt, the Hollywood crowd — assuming they aren’t too busy boycotting the state (Wink! Wink!) — will respond with some slick PR campaign defending the massive giveaways and killing the messengers but in my opinion and that of the state auditors, the state government needs to get this boondoggle under control now.
 Admittedly, I am a grumpy old man and don’t know much about show business, but I think even Lassie would agree that the state’s current film tax credit scheme is a bunch of poop

Original members Ronnie Van Zant, Bob Burns, Allen Collins, Gary Rossington, and Larry Junstrom formed the band in 1964, originally known as My Backyard, the band changed to its famous name in the early 1970s, and became popular in the Jacksonville, FL area, where the original members were from. They signed with Sounds of the South Records in 1972 and released their self-titled disc the following year. The album that featured "Free Bird," arguably the most- recognized single in the Southern Rock genre, has sold more than 2 million units since its release. Later down the road the band recorded iconic tracks "Sweet Home Alabama" and "What's Your Name."

Celie and Nettie are found center stage at the opening of the show, singing and clapping out "Huckleberry Pie" and their deep bond is apparent from the moment their voices combine in sweet sister harmony. The action moves quickly and the songs keep coming with the powerful chorus leading the way. Soon, we find Celie in the throws of a painful labor as she delivers her second child and sings "Somebody Gonna Love You" to the baby girl who is immediately taken from her. Lyttle's voice is exceptional and compelling and she envelops the role of Celie like she's known her forever. To watch her develop the character and grow right along with her was remarkable. Her overbearing and iron-fisted husband Mister, played expertly by Andrew Malone, is a striking contrast to Celie's tender heart. He is indeed a brutal and evil man who seems to take great pleasure in making her life a living hell. Malone is more than convincing in this role, with a big voice, a big whip and a larger than life stage presence, especially in his opening song "Big Dog", a call and response number featuring the men's chorus and some expertly handled chairs doubling as farm equipment. His children, his chores (and his bed) take over Celie's life and her path of misery continues. Mister's blundering son Harpo, Brandon A. Wright, announces that he intends to marry the brazen and outspoken Sophia, played by Chedra Arielle. When Sophia discovers that Harpo's father instructed him to beat her to tame her spirited ways, she turns the tables and strikes back with a resounding "Hell No!" a rousing "I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take it" song that sets Harpo (and anyone else thinking about doing her wrong) straight.

ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — New York has become the 10th state to allow adopted adults unrestricted access to their original birth certificates, a step that will help some people investigate their family histories. A new law effective Wednesday does away with restrictions dating back to the 1930s that required an adoptee to seek a hard-to-get court order to access original birth records. Those rules had originally been intended to protect the privacy of parents who relinquished their children. But attitudes about the rights of adopted individuals have shifted, while social media and DNA technology have made it easier for long-separated relatives to connect. Restrictions in New York and nationwide dated back to a time when many women were coerced or shamed into giving up their babies, according to Joyce Bahr, who gave up her son for adoption in 1966 and now serves as president of the New York Statewide Adoption Reform’s Unsealed Initiative, which pushed for New York's law. “Times were different and we were also led to believe our children would go off and live happily ever after, which was a little far-fetched concept,” she said. Bahr ended up reuniting with her biological son, Ed, when she relocated to New York. She said the two “loved each other right away.” “I can understand that there are some birth mothers who don’t want to be found,” Bahr said. Some Catholic groups, adoption agencies, and some birth mothers and adoptive parents, had opposed lifting the privacy restrictions over fear about traumatizing people — including survivors of rape and incest — who had given up their children. Staten Island resident Joe Pessalano, 58, is one of roughly 600,000 New Yorkers who advocates have estimated will be able to access their birth certificates starting...

Midway through the first act, we meet the drunken and flamboyant singer , Shug Avery, played so beautifully by Sandie Lee. She is Mister's one true love and Celie soon understands why. Her tough exterior hides a heart of gold, especially in her touching rendition of "Too Beautiful for Words", her juke joint romp and stomp song "Push da Button" and her duet with Cecie, "What About Love" at the end of the first act.

The second act is a contrast to the first, in tone, message and color. The opening number "African Homeland" sung by Nettie and Celie gives us a glimpse into Nettie's life thus far while colorful African banners billow over her head . "Miss Celie's Pants" is a ray of sunshine, harmonies and rainbow hues as the woman in the cast celebrate Celie's new business venture. But the pivotal moment in act two is Lyttle's brilliant performance of "I'm Here". Her voice soars in all the right places and had the audience in tears by the end. Other highlights and standouts of the performance came from the church ladies, played by Elizabeth Adabale, Parris Lewis and Shelby A. Sykes, providing the musical narrative in almost a Greek chorus/Pickalittle Ladies sort of way, with spot on harmonies and lyrics that brought the much needed comedy and laughter at just the right moments. Gabriella Rodriguez was simply delightful as Squeak, Harpo's other love interest and another strong willed woman who finds her voice.

“As the work examines ideas that originated within AI, it’s tempting to focus on the flow of ideas from AI to neuroscience. However, we think the results are equally important for AI,” said DeepMind director of neuroscience research Matt Botvinick. “When we’re able to demonstrate that the brain employs algorithms like those we are using in our AI work, it bolsters our confidence that those algorithms will be useful in the long run — that they will scale well to complex real-world problems and interface well with other computational processes. There’s a kind of validation involved: If the brain is doing it, it’s probably a good idea.”
