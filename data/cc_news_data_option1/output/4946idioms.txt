Rooney, the late Pittsburgh Steelers owner, emphasized three traits when hiring a head coach: leadership, communication and character. A head coach must command the room and be able to communicate with a diverse group of people. Gibbs focused on a coach's management ability and how well he or she could evaluate players and staff. When Gibbs arrived in Washington in 1981, he wanted to run a wide-open offense but quickly adjusted to a system that leaned on two-tight end sets after discovering his initial vision wasn't working -- a radical move in the NFL at that time. Being able to put his ego aside and construct a game plan that better suited his personnel was so valuable. He led Washington to an 8-3 finish that season after a 0-5 start, and won his first of three Super Bowls with the team the following season.

Next in the pecking order of general manager responsibilities is establishing the reporting structure -- or who reports to who. During my time as general manager in Washington and Houston, the head coach and I reported directly to the owner. Personally, I would not have taken a GM job unless I had a direct line to the owner because he or she will ultimately decide who is hired and, most important, fired. One immediate decision a new GM may have to make is whether or not to retain members of the current staff.

Lastly, establishing a great working relationship with the head coach is very critical to team success. The head coach must present his vision for what the team looks like on and off the field, and in turn, the GM's job is to get the coach the players to fit the system. This vision must be clear for all parties and discussed in the interview process. Responsibilities on other matters -- including final say on trades, waiver claims and free-agent signings, among other things -- must also be discussed in full.

In linea generale, le funzioni non legislative si sono rivelate quelle più compatibili con il parlamentarismo dell’emergenza. Con queste funzioni, il Parlamento indirizza e controlla l’esecutivo, intervenendo sia prima della decisione dell’esecutivo, per orientarne e vincolarne politicamente l’azione, sia successivamente, per verificare la corrispondenza dell’agire governativo rispetto a determinati parametri politici o legislativi. Durante tutta la durata della crisi, i Parlamenti hanno cercato di compensare con la funzione di indirizzo e controllo la perdita di influenza sul terreno della legislazione. Due fenomeni paralleli hanno contribuito a tale risultato. Da un lato, i procedimenti di controllo sono quelli più congeniali alle nuove regole di distanziamento fisico. Tali meccanismi non si traducono in deliberazioni che richiedono un voto in commissione o in Aula oppure prevedono un numero limitato di votazioni. Il loro obiettivo principale è raccogliere informazioni e orientamenti al fine di sviluppare quello che viene definito il “diritto di critica” del Parlamento rispetto all’operato del Governo. La relativa indipendenza dei meccanismi di controllo dalle procedure di voto spiega perché di solito non sia richiesto un quorum strutturale: è il caso delle interrogazioni e interpellanze, delle audizioni, dell’esame delle relazioni governative, delle indagini conoscitive, delle inchieste.

Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

The space agency gave no reason for landing its latest probe on the Sea of Storms, far from where American and Soviet craft touched down. But the choice might help to shed light on possible sites being studied for a crewed mission.
 Beijing's space plane would be China's version of the American Space Shuttle and the former Soviet Union's short-lived Buran.
 China also has launched its own Beidou network of navigation satellites so the Communist Party's military wing, the People's Liberation Army, doesn't need to rely on the U.S.-run GPS or a rival Russian system.
 Last year, China graduated from "me too" missions copying Soviet and American ventures to scoring its own firsts when it became the first nation to land a probe on the moon's little-explored far side.
 That probe, the Chang'e 4, and its robot rover still are functioning, transmitting to Earth via an orbiter that passes over the moon's far side. China's first moon lander, the Chang'e 3, still is transmitting.
 China's earliest crewed spacecraft, the Shenzhou capsules, were based on Russian technology. Its powerful Long March rockets are, like their Soviet and American predecessors, based on ballistic missiles developed using technology seized from Nazi Germany after World War II.
 China has proceeded more cautiously than the breakneck U.S.-Soviet space race of the 1960s, which was marked by fatalities. China's crewed missions have gone ahead without incident. Some launches of robot vehicles have been delayed by technical problems but those appear to have been resolved.
 China is in a growing space rivalry with Asian neighbors Japan and India, which it sees as strategic competitors. Both have sent their own probes to Mars.
 While Chang'e 5 gathers moon rocks, Japan's space agency just pulled off the even more challenging feat of obtaining samples from an asteroid, Ryugu. The Hayabusa2 mission is due to deliver those to Earth on Saturday.
 As its confidence grows, Beijing's space goals have multiplied.
 It has joined the race to explore Mars, and its Tianwen-1 probe, launched in July carrying a robot rover to search for signs of water, is due to complete its 470-million kilometer (292-million mile) journey in February.
 Plans call for a permanent crewed space station as early as 2022.
 China is excluded from the International Space Station due to U.S. opposition to including Chinese military officers in a venture that otherwise is operated by civilian space agencies.
 Plans also call for an international lunar research base at some point, the deputy director of the Chinese agency's lunar exploration center, Pei Zhaoyu, told reporters last week.
 Despite its successes, the military-run Chinese program is more secretive than those of other governments.
 Yang and other Chinese astronauts made only a handful of brief public appearances following their flights, in contrast to Soviet and American astronauts who were sent on global publicity tours before cheering foreign crowds.
 The agency announced in September its space plane had completed a successful test flight but has yet to release details or even a photo of the craft.

1. A majority of the Falcons' issues are on the defensive side of the ball. The front seven has struggled to hold its own in 2020, so it would make sense to get bigger along the defensive line and at linebacker.    2. Improving the pass rush must be a huge priority. The only proven pass rushers on the roster right now are defensive tackle Grady Jarrett and defensive end Dante Fowler﻿, who is having a down year by his standards. Atlanta must add at least one more rusher at linebacker or defensive end in free agency or the draft.    3. What is the plan at running back? Todd Gurley﻿, who's made his money in the red zone in 2020, and Brian Hill are set to become free agents. Do you bring one or both of them back? Or let them walk? Will they sign a back from what is shaping up to be a decent pool of talent at the position in free agency or look to the draft for help?

1. Do you keep quarterback Matthew Stafford﻿? The veteran didn't address his future in Detroit when asked about it earlier this week, but the question will be addressed one way or another after the season. Though he's not in peak form and will be 33 years old at the start of next season, I would keep him. His arm talent hasn't dropped off and he's a great leader in the locker room.   2. Extend Kenny Golladay﻿, who's in the final year of his rookie deal. He is the Lions' top offensive playmaker right now, having recorded 1,000 yards in 2018 and '19 and a league-leading 11 receiving TDs last season. Though he's battled hamstring and hip injuries that have sidelined him for all but five games this season, the 27-year-old wide receiver still has a lot to offer as a nightmare matchup for most defenders.   3. On defense, adding speed and playmaking ability across the board should be high on the to-do list. There is room for improvement on all three levels of the unit.

For the time being, filming the police in France is still legal, even if an officer argues they've been harmed by being observed. Unfortunately, the proposal isn't completely dead. Article 24 will be revamped but it won't be until early next year. Right now, the bill is too hot to touch. A couple of months in the cooler -- and the onset of cooler weather -- might temper both protesters and belatedly irate lawmakers. If so, it could reappear mostly unchanged, especially if legislators feel the security of the nation is more important than law enforcement accountability.

In questo ambito, non manca infatti una sensazione di diffusa frustrazione per le ricadute politico-istituzionali dell’attività svolta dal Parlamento. Da un lato, il controllo produce risultati politici indiretti e differiti, che dipendono dalla disponibilità dell’esecutivo a recepire gli esiti delle procedure parlamentari. Dall’altro lato, le ragioni dell’emergenza hanno reso più divisiva politicamente anche quella sfera di attività non legislativa che di regola consente maggiori spazi alla cooperazione tra maggioranza e opposizione. Comprendere questi processi e i relativi rischi latenti è il primo passaggio per strutturare un nuovo stile di rapporti tra il potere legislativo e quello esecutivo pienamente coerente con la dimensione dell’ _accountability._ Rispetto a tutte queste trasformazioni, la sfida è grande anche per il nostro Parlamento italiano: la pandemia può essere un forte acceleratore delle riforme che servono per adeguare la strumentazione parlamentare all’esigenza di costruire nuove garanzie ed argini alle decisioni degli esecutivi. In questo senso, la revisione dei regolamenti parlamentari appena avviata da entrambe le Camere può rappresentare una utile finestra per affrontare i nodi della legislazione e del controllo che rimangono irrisolti, partendo dai maxi-emendamenti coperti da questione di fiducia e dal controllo di finanza pubblica.
