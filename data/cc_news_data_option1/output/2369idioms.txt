It's always a challenge to figure out how to begin a movie, to choose what the very first shot should be. That task is handily and appropriately and endearingly accomplished in this documentary about fathers. It opens with 39-year-old video footage of its director - Bryce Dallas Howard - being born, and her dad - Ron Howard - right there in the delivery room, getting it on tape.      For her first time as a feature director - she's previously done shorts and episodic TV - Howard maintains a refreshing approach to her subject, while at the same time playing it relatively safe. The idea was to interview a bunch of dads, in separate sessions, all being asked the same or at least similar questions. For instance, "In simplest terms, what is a father?" Or, "Do you remember the first time you held your baby?" That's the playing it safe part. Even though there's a variety of answers, it's the repetition of those sorts of questions that keeps the film running smoothly on-track.      The refreshing approach is that Howard who, by being in show business, knows a lot of people in show business, fills the film's roster with celebrity dads, among them Judd Apatow, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Conan O'Brien, Will Smith, and her own dad. They each stand in a large empty space, in front of a colorful blank wall, answering the questions being asked by her, off-camera.      She ups the ante and makes the film more accessible by slyly turning those instantly recognizable, familiar men into something like background characters. She keeps cutting back to them as they answer questions, make comments, smile, and laugh and, in a couple of cases, shed a few tears. But she keeps the main focus on a gaggle of everyday, non-celebrity dads from around the world. They also answer questions and make comments. But they're not on a soundstage; they're at home, interacting with their kids, both as they're being interviewed and in a plentiful supply of their own home movies.      There's Glen Henry, who explains how much fun it is as well as how difficult it is to be the father of three kids. There's Robert Selby, a single dad whose son has had major health problems since birth, talking about and showing us how close they are. The same-sex couple of Rob and Reece Scheer discuss the wild ride it's been since they adopted four kids in six months. The most compelling segment, in Tokyo, features Shuichi Sakuma, who became a late-in- life father only after overcoming his own health issues.      These unknown guys are the meat and potatoes of the film, and they provide the most insight to the subject. But Howard's structure has things regularly jump back to the well-known folks for some candid frosting on the cake: Judd Apatow admits that upon finding out his wife was pregnant, he wasn't the least bit prepared for what was to come. Conan O'Brien adds, "We're all making this up as we go. There's no school for this." Neil Patrick Harris brings up that fatherhood has increased his sleep deprivation. Ron Howard, comically and unexpectedly letting a couple of curse words slip out, talks about how wonderful the early years are, "up till about 12." Will Smith is excitable and hilarious. Howard's younger brother Reed, whose wife's due date is a month away, is seen grappling with the installation of a car seat.      These are all deeply caring people. Some of them wonder and worry if they're around their kids enough and even if they're around them too much. Some of the answers are very sweet, but are matched up with an awareness of responsibility. To her credit, Howard has balanced everything to make the film both funny and profound.      "Dads" is available on Apple TV+ starting June 19.      Ed Symkus can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.

Farmers couldn’t go to farms during the lockdown and the way we feed in Nigeria, we don’t have large-scale commercial farming. The normal strategy we adopt as a country in farming is that during the rainy season, we make do with what we receive from the last season, harvest and plant for the next raining season. So we feed hand to mouth. Some of the foods that are being stored for this raining reason were already distributed as part of the palliatives for COVID-19. I am not talking about wheat-based food like semovita or pasta because they are mostly imported and the food processed here. I am talking about foods like rice, yam, cassava base and millet that we have produced a certain amount as volume that was harvested and people are going to feed for all this time until the next harvest season comes. Since we didn’t store more than we need or enough to feed twice our population, we even barely have enough to feed half of the population and we have now started distributing some out in advance. Those who got the palliatives are even small compared to those who did not get and that means the food they could easily have bought from the market few months down the line is already distributed in advance to somebody and if we add the Nigerian factor where people hoard, someone may be making money out of this jamboree and further compound our problems. If we don’t think carefully about moving down, suddenly, we may find prices of food going up or it is either we go to Ghana to import or we will live with some food crisis. Government needs to recognise the challenges faced by farmers to find ways to mitigate the losses they would have. If they were short of grains, they should provide them with grains they need to plant or funds to support them and ensure they stay above water and be able to continue to keep their farms going and hopefully they’ll be able to give us some harvest from the next harvest season.

And when you set the goal when you start with a small sum, you'll see how the market over the long term if you invest in a good business will reward you. If you don't have a clear set goal and you don't focus on fundamentals you focus on the market, you'll get lost in this. You will get lost in what's going on in the market, the ups and downs, the crashes, the pundits that say this will happen or that will happen.

La llave secreta de un hacker es encontrar una vulnerabilidad para aprovecharlo al maximo. Pero, tambien hay hackers eticos que ayudan a descubrir fallas para buscar una solucion, como Chema Alonso, reconocido por evidenciar las brechas en los sistemas de la red.En su blog se publicaron muchas formas en la que tu cuenta de WhatsApp puede ser hackeado, entre ellas esta el mecanismo de registro de cuenta donde se el usuario recibe un codigo en el telefono convirtiendose en un objetivo.Hackeo por buzon de vozAparte de la verificacion de cuenta por correo, existe la autenticacion basada en el numero de telefono. Ahora imagine la situacion en la que el atacante quiere acceder a tu cuenta de WhatsApp. Luego de instalar la aplicacion, tednra que indicar cual es tu numero de telefono de la cuenta que quiere "recuperar" en otro terminal y luego seleccionar uno de los metodos de verificacion.Escenario 1En este escenario llega a tu telefono un SMS que el atacante solicito para el codigo de verificacion del numero. El mensaje advierte que no debes compartir el codigo con nadie, pero los hackers suelen usar metodos para obtenerlo desde ingenieria social hasta metodos mas elaborados. Sin embargo, con las correctas medidas, la verificacion de SMS es mas segura si no caes en trampas. Escenario 2En otra situacion, el codigo de verificacion se envia por SMS y, si al cabo de un minuto, no se ha introducido, la victima podria recibir una llamada a su numero de telefono donde se le indica cual es el codigo de verificacion. Si el hacker dispusiera del telefono de la victima, accederia al codigo facilmente, ya que para contestar una llamada no se necesita desbloquear el telefono.Escenario 3Pero imaginemos que la victima no coge la llamada, automaticamente WhatsApp te deja un mensaje en el buzon de voz, entonces te pueden robar el codigo desde ahi y suele haber dos maneras de acceder al buzon de voz.Haciendo la llamada desde el numero de telefono al buzon de voz, por lo que no ingresas ninguna contraseña.El hacker realiza una llamada a tu buzon de voz desde un telefono distinto, donde se le pedira una contraseña, puede&nbsp;"recurrir a estadisticas sobre la frecuencia de uso de los numero PIN, en donde el 1234 es el mas frecuente, seguido del 1111 y del 0000" , indica la entrada subida por la hacker española Yaiza Rubio.Como proteger tu cuentaPuedes bloquear los numeros de telefono que utiliza WhatsApp para la verificacion, sin embargo, la mejor opcion es desactivar o proteger con un nuevo PIN el acceso remoto a tu buzon de voz, esta gestion puedes realizarlo con tu operadora movil.Te recomendamos&nbsp;METADATA, el podcast de tecnologia de&nbsp;RPP.&nbsp;Noticias, analisis, reseñas, recomendaciones&nbsp;y todo lo que debes saber sobre el&nbsp;mundo tecnologico.
