The government's decision to extend free ration to November could lead to higher procurement by agencies, supporting prices. As prices trade below the MSP of Rs 4,875 per quintal, and the government is taking steps to benefit farmers by raising their field of operations to get better rates, this remains a bullish factor for chana in the long term.

In light of what occurred in the past, what we’re encountering now is almost ridiculous. Political “leadership” denies facts about the nature, transmission, and effects of COVID-19. An economy is being kept afloat based on baseless, unsustainable financial instruments. There is more and more visual evidence of how bad it’s gotten; streets full of closed stores characterize cities large and small. Some will eventually reopen when the virus is considered under control, but name brands like Neiman-Marcus, J.C. Penney, Macy’s, Brooks Brothers, J. Crew and Pier 1 will have gone out of business, or at least into bankruptcy. A total of at least 25,000 stores will be gone.

Republicans have made recapturing the once reliably red state a priority, seeing it as their best chance to pick up a seat in the battle for partisan control of the Senate.
 “We want that seat back. … It’s going to be a battle, but we are going to win the war," Alabama Republican Party chair Terry Lathan said.
 On Tuesday night, Trump tweeted his joy with Tuberville's win, denying Sessions the chance to reclaim the Senate seat he left to join the president's administration. Trump harshly criticized his first attorney general for recusing himself from the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign.
 Trump said Wednesday that Tuberville would be a “great senator"and denounced Jones as “not doing the job.”
 The 100-day race is shaping up to be expensive as well as contentious.
 One Nation, a group aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, has reserved $3.2 million in ad time in Alabama and Club for Growth, a conservative organization focused on economic issues, also has begun airing a $1.3 million ad buy against Jones.

Edwina Webb Cameron, 91, passed away peacefully, in the Hawthorne Woods Assisted Living Facility, Tuesday, July 14, 2020. Richard Cameron, her loving husband of 69 years, was by her side.Born Edwina Brown Webb April 24, 1929, in Dayton, Ohio, Winnie was the youngest of two children born to Howard and Martha Webb.After graduating from Oakwood High School in 1947, Winnie matriculated at Denison University in Granville, Ohio, her proud father's alma mater. She pledged the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, studied sociology, and sang alto in the school choir, where she would soon meet a sophomore tenor named Richard Cameron. Harmonizing in the college choir led to collegiate romance and, following her graduation from Denison in 1951, Dick and Winnie were married in Dayton in June of that same year. The newlyweds moved to Dick's hometown of Washington shortly thereafter and began their married life together.While Dick took his place in the family business, Cameron Coca-Cola, Winnie became a stay-at-home mom who rarely stayed at home, so involved was she in the lives of her children. Perennial home-room mother, Cub Scout den leader, and chauffeur to her five active, athletic children, it was not uncommon for Winnie to make the rounds to East Washington Grade School, the Washington Park baseball fields, the Elmhurst Swim Club, and the LeMoyne Center in the few hours between the end of school and dinner time. Setting a superb example for her four sons and one daughter, Winnie created a loving family environment and encouraged her children to develop their individual talents and interests. Her devotion to and love of family spanned a lifetime. The first of 12 grandchildren arrived in 1982; the first of nine great-grandchildren hit the ground running in 2012, and number 10 is due to arrive in the fall of 2020.Deeply involved in the life of her community, Winnie served as president of the Washington Hospital Ladies Auxiliary and was a long-time member of the Board of Trustees for Washington and Jefferson College. As a member of the college's property and grounds committee, Winnie was instrumental in making decisions that positively changed the landscape of the college and the surrounding community. In October 1997, W&amp;J recognized her contributions with the Distinguished Service Award. In May 2000, Winnie received an honorary doctorate from W&amp;J, the college's highest honor.Mrs. Cameron is survived by her husband, Richard R. Cameron; and her five children, Richard (Diana Gonzlez-Cameron) Cameron of Chicago, Ill., William (Susan Martinelli) Cameron, James (Nancy) Cameron, Steve (Diane) Cameron and Lynn (Alex) Pentecost, all of Washington. Winnie's 12 grandchildren and nine great- grandchildren stand as her most profound legacy.Deceased is a brother, Howard Webb Jr., of Carbondale, Ill.All funeral arrangements and burial in the Washington Cemetery are private and under the direction of the Warco-Falvo Funeral Home, Inc., Wilson at East Katherine Avenues, Washington, S. Timothy Warco, supervisor / director, Susan Falvo Warco, director, S. Timothy Warco II, director.In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made in Mrs. Cameron's memory to either the Washington Hospital or Washington and Jefferson College.Condolences may be expressed at www.WarcoFalvoFuneralHome.com.
