A sequence of images taken by one of the monitoring cameras on board the European-Japanese BepiColombo mission to Mercury, as the spacecraft made a close approach of Venus on 15 October 2020.


  This sequence of 64 images was captured by Monitoring Camera 2 onboard the Mercury Transfer Module from 40 minutes before until 15 minutes after closest approach of 10 720 km from Venus. The images were taken every 52 seconds. The camera provides black-and-white snapshots in 1024 x 1024 pixel resolution.


  In these images, Venus appears in the top right behind the Mercury Planetary Orbiter’s magnetometer boom and moves across the field of view towards the spacecraft’s medium gain antenna. The shape of the terminator – the boundary between the fully illuminated planet (day) and the fully shadowed area (night) – clearly changes, showing that the spacecraft’s path curves around from the dayside to the nightside.


  The images have been lightly processed to enhance the brightness and contrast. The illuminated disk of Venus is so bright that it is saturated in these images, even using the shortest possible camera exposure time. At the planet’s terminator, some very faint structures are visible, but these appear to be due to ghosting in the camera optics rather than features in the atmosphere of Venus. There is also some horizontal striping in the images due to effects in the electronics.


  The gravity assist manoeuvre was the first at Venus and the second of nine flybys overall, which help steer the spacecraft on course for Mercury.  During its seven-year cruise to the smallest and innermost planet of the Solar System, BepiColombo makes one flyby at Earth, two at Venus and six at Mercury to brake against the gravitational pull of the Sun in order to enter orbit around Mercury. BepiColombo, which comprises ESA’s Mercury Planetary Orbiter and the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), is scheduled to reach its target orbit around the smallest and innermost planet of the Solar System in 2025.

Prosecutors said they are looking nationwide for Dayvault, who didn't show up for any of the four days of her trial at the Horry County courthouse.


  “There’s an empty seat over there. Somebody messed up," said John Matechen, the father of Dayvault’s boyfriend, who thanked jurors for doing their job and finding Dayvault guilty.


  Dayvault's boyfriend was the father of both children and said he was heartbroken and stunned after finding out what had been going on the past two years.


  “Hopefully with this it will be a little easier for me and my family to get through this. It is by far and away the hardest thing we’ve ever had to deal with. Justice coming to her makes it a little easier to comprehend," Chris Matechen told the judge as he considered Dayvault's sentence.


  John Matechen said the family felt betrayed.


  “We welcomed Alyssa into our lives with open arms. We’re a very trusting family," he said. “People often say how in the heck did you guys not know that she was pregnant? She was really, really good.”


  The trial was livestreamed from the Horry County courthouse by WMBF-TV.

BROCKTON - Unbeknownst to Brockton taxpayers, city funds were used last year to foot the bill for a private funeral.


  Under former mayor Moises Rodrigues, $6,640 in Brockton tax dollars went to pay for a private funeral arrangement for a 61-year-old man from Cape Verde, who was fatally struck by a police cruiser while crossing Main Street outside of the Morabeza Club in August 2019, according to public records recently obtained by The Enterprise, after receiving an anonymous tip about the situation. The costs were quietly paid out of the Finance Department budget, with a September 2019 purchase order that was signed by the city's chief financial officer, Troy Clarkson, in response to an invoice from Funerarias Multi Culturel, the funeral home owned by Board of Health member George Fiske.


  Rodrigues also authorized a $9,999 payment for another funeral later last year, just a dollar under the $10,000 threshold that would by law require a public procurement process. This was for a 75-year-old woman, also of Cape Verdean descent, who was fatally struck by a police cruiser in December 2019.


  However, the second funeral payment was stopped after current Mayor Robert Sullivan took office in January, asking the Law Department to determine the legality of the taxpayer-funded expense, as a potential misappropriation of public funds. As a result, the David Russell Funeral Home in Brockton was left shortchanged, expecting a payment from the city, after telling the family of the 75-year-old that the city offered to cover funeral costs.


  Scroll to the bottom of the story to view copies of the purchase orders and an invoice for the funerals paid for by Brockton taxpayers.


  Rodrigues, who was re-elected and returned to his former office as a councilor-at-large this year, after being appointed as mayor to fill the unexpired term of Bill Carpenter following his July 2019 death, said it was an "appropriate" response by the city to pay for the funerals, staving off potential lawsuits. Rodrigues noted that these events took place in a year marked by Black Lives Matter protests and a $5 million settlement agreed to by the city after getting sued successfully by a former city job applicant named Russell Lopes over allegations of employment discrimination. Rodrigues said the 61-year-old man, named Antonio Tavares, was Black. And so was the 75-year- old woman, Maria Graca, he said.


  However, there was never any wrongdoing ascribed to the Brockton police officers involved with the fatal crash, they did not face any charges, and Rodrigues said he didn't get any agreements from the families of the deceased not to sue the city in the future. Brockton City Solicitor Megan Bridges confirmed that the city never faced a threat of a lawsuit or reached any settlements with the Tavares or Graca families. The Enterprise reached out last week to the Brockton Police Department, which referred questions about investigations into the fatal crashes to the Plymouth County District Attorney's Office. The DA's office said it would look into the matter, but did not confirm whether the crashes are still under investigation, or provide any other information.


  "I wanted to be proactive and do the right thing, to bury a guy one of our cruisers killed, and to fend off any possibility of any legal action against the city," said Rodrigues, who was the first Cape Verdean mayor of the city of Brockton, reached by phone earlier this week. "We were trying to settle wrongdoing over a Black man killed by a police car. ... Did you hear of a lawsuit being filed against the city? No. You never know when things can end up in court. It depends on the temperature of the country and the way we are doing things."


  This situation raises the question whether the funeral expense served a lawful and legitimate public purpose. That's what caused current Mayor Robert Sullivan to put a hold on a $9,999 purchase order to the David Russell Funeral Home in January to cover the costs of Graca's funeral services.


  "Under my administration, when I took office, of course I wanted to be open and transparent and do everything above board," said Sullivan, in a statement to the Enterprise. "I wanted the Law Department to look at everything. The secondary payment has been paused. The payment has not been made by the city of Brockton, until I could have it fully reviewed by the Law Department. This (cost authorization) happened before I took office."


  The situation has put funeral home owner David Russell in a bind, after first telling the family of Graca that the city offered to cover funeral expenses.


  Russell declined to comment when asked about the situation last week. However, Russell said before this, the city never offered to cover the cost of another funeral at his business, making it an unusual situation.


  "I'm waiting for an answer for certain things," he said.


  Fiske, the Board of Health Member, whose funeral home was paid out for the funeral of Tavares, said he didn't recall all the details about what happened.


  "I don't know really what happened on that," Fiske said, reached on Wednesday. "I think maybe the city helped with that. It could be. I just don't remember."


  An invoice with a Funerarias Multi Culturel letterhead, which was signed by Fiske on Sept. 6 last year, and a corresponding statement of goods and services details the costs of a full funeral package for the Tavares, including $375 for a limo for the family of the deceased, a silver metal casket, flowers, a cemetery lot and other expenses.


  Asked if it was appropriate for a public official to receive a payment to his business for this reason, Fiske repeated that he was unsure about the specifics of the situation. Fiske asked a reporter to call back later, but when the Enterprise called back again he was busy, and the Enterprise left a message with his son seeking comment for this story.


  "I wouldn't say it's unusual," Fiske said. "Like I said, I can't remember. I'm going to have to look at the file."


  Rodrigues said it was the right thing to do to pay for the funerals.


  "I had heard complaints that the families were very upset," Rodrigues said. "I heard the DA had never reached out to the families to even inform them of what actually had taken place. And no one from the police department reached out to the family to basically even have a conversation with them as to basically what took place. ... These individuals didn't have life insurance for those funerals. Understanding that a Brockton police car actually killed them, I decided as the mayor to pay for the funerals. As mayor, I decided that's what I'd do on behalf of the people in the city to make sure those individuals were buried with the dignity and respect they deserved."


  Rodrigues blamed the anonymous tipster who alerted the Enterprise about the funeral payouts for "opening up a can of worms" and putting the city at legal risk.


  "It shows irresponsibility on something that took place over a year ago," Rodrigues said. "If anyone had a problem with it back in February or March, somewhere back that time, it could have been brought out. This is digging through some stuff one way or another."


  Rodrigues also rejected comparisons to a political controversy involving Carpenter, who authorized the use of city funds for burial suits for two murder victims in the city, along with flower arrangements for nearly 30 Brockton area funerals in fiscal 2016. Carpenter bought flowers from Posh Flowers and Gifts, which is owned by Ward 7 City Councilor Shirley Asack, and he bought the suits with public funds from Tuxedos by Merian, owned by a campaign supporter and a then-commissioner on the Brockton License Commission. Carpenter later refunded the city from his campaign account for $7,850 in flowers, burial suits and other miscellaneous personal expenses, including a Cape Verdean language course he took at Massasoit Community College.


  "To make a comparison between a suit that was bought basically to pander to a community, versus a funeral expenses that occurred because of one of our cars, to me is ludicrous," Rodrigues said. "We were in the middle of discussions on settlements in the Lopes case where the city had wronged a Black man. Here are two Black people hit by police cars, killed in the city of Brockton. I saw this as a way of dealing with those issues and to prevent it from becoming an incendiary, as far as the city is concerned. To me, to compare the two, it's apples and pineapples. I find it ludicrous and insensitive in a way, buying a suit for politics, versus doing the right thing for a person our car killed."

  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's unfortunate passing has turned all of the nation's political eyes, once again, to the United States Supreme Court.


  Understandably, much of the national talk about the 2020 elections is on the appointment of Judge Amy Coney Barrett and her critical role in shaping the nation's highest court. Here in North Carolina, however, we have even more judicial positions that deserve our attention.


  On the North Carolina Supreme Court, there is currently a 6-1 majority of activist, liberal judges and only one, lonely conservative - Justice Paul Newby.


  That imbalance is incredibly unhealthy for our judicial system, but in 2020 things could go from bad to worse. These are the same liberal judges who overturned the will of the people of North Carolina by unilaterally declaring a Constitutional amendment, somehow, unconstitutional in throwing out Voter ID.


  These judges let their own personal political views override the voice of the people. Three Supreme Court seats are on the ballot this year.


  Conservative candidates include Justice Newby as chief justice, Judge Phil Berger Jr., and Tamara Barringer. Similarly, the N.C. Court of Appeals has five seats on the ballot this year. Conservative candidates for those seats include Judge Jeff Carpenter, Judge Fred Gore, Judge Chris Dillon, Judge Jefferson Griffin, and Judge April Wood.


  Each of these judges will bring a wealth of prior judicial experience and balance to the Court of Appeals.


  Here in Gaston County, Donald Rice is the conservative candidate for District Court judge in the only local contested judicial race. As a prosecutor with more than 14 years of experience in the judicial system, Donald has been a great supporter of our law enforcement, while also working with offenders to make sure they get the rehabilitation they need and justice that is fair.


  He is a true public servant that will bring honesty, integrity, and balance to our local court.


  As you can see, 2020 is a crucial year for our court system up and down the ballot. Please be sure to finish your ballot this year - on both sides - and don't forget the judicial races.


  Straight-party ticket voting isn't an option in North Carolina, so be sure to vote for each race individually. For a complete conservative voter guide or to get information on voting times and locations, visit www.finishyourballot.org.


   _Jonathan Fletcher is chairman of the Gaston County Republican Party._

A deep monsoon depression over the west central Bay of Bengal, which weakened as it moved over Telangana, resulted in downpours over several districts in the State, severely affecting the city of Hyderabad as well. On October 13, the monthly average rainfall of Hyderabad for October (103.6 mm according to Skymet) was surpassed on a single day when 192 mm of rain fell. According to the India Meteorological Department, this is the highest rainfall for October recorded in Telangana’s capital since 1903. Such a high intensity downpour in a short span is bound to affect a densely populated urban area, and Hyderabad was no exception. At least 24 people were killed and several localities submerged and isolated following incessant rains and the overflowing of the city’s lakes. Other districts were badly affected too: roads damaged and irrigation tanks breached. The monsoon storm that never became a cyclone, has managed to cross the east (Andhra Pradesh) and west coasts (north Karnataka and Maharashtra) of India. This is rare and a rain-related disaster event that is difficult to plan for. Floods and deluges, like any other disaster, disproportionately affect the poor. Disaster management agencies have managed to limit the impact of the disaster as many of those marooned in submerged areas and flooded houses were rescued. But the extent of the damage and the turmoil show a lack of preparation and disaster mitigation, a problem that plagues most urban centres in the country.


  Much of the damage was due to the overflowing of lakes — in particular, the Hussain Sagar Lake in the middle of the city and the breaching of storm water drains. Construction over lake beds and encroachments of drainage channels have been identified as problems that have exacerbated flooding and inundation in the city in the past (the deluge in August 2000, for example). But the little that has been done to unblock existing storm drains over the last decade has not been enough to handle the requirements of the city, which still depends upon an antiquated sewerage and drainage system. Hyderabad urgently needs to expand and remodel its drainage system. Besides lakes and canals, wetlands and watersheds play a vital role in absorbing excess rainfall, but regrettably, rapid urbanisation in the twin cities has resulted in the loss of a large portion of the wetlands. An analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment in 2016 revealed that 3,245 hectares of water bodies were lost in Hyderabad between 1989 and 2001. In the long term, the effects of flooding due to deluges can only be mitigated if urban planners take into account the hydro-geology of cities and ensure that construction, development and land occupation do not take place in a way that reduces the area of wetlands.

John Dean Brubaker 1930—2020   A man of great heart, John Dean Brubaker's finally faded as he passed away peacefully in his sleep on Tuesday, October 13, 2020, at his home in Rockford, Illinois, surrounded by family and loved ones. He will be missed by all.   Known to everyone as "Jake," he was the fourth son of five born to Helen and Clyde Brubaker of Litchfield, Illinois. After graduating from the University of Arizona in 1953, Jake was stationed outside London as a Lieutenant, following his brothers in service to the United States. He then came to Rockford to pursue his ambitions.   Always clever with machinery, Jake was initially involved in several manufacturing concerns in Rockford, ultimately building Aqua-Aerobic Systems, a highly successful water filtration and treatment systems manufacturer with a world-wide reach.   Jake, a mentor to many both in business and in life, has long been a quiet philanthropist in the Northern Illinois Region. These charitable activities will continue as his legacy.   Jake was proceeded in death by his beloved wife, Mary Brubaker and his talented son, Andrew Brubaker. He is survived by another son, John Fredrick "Fred" Brubaker; a daughter, Cynthia Borcherts; Cynthia's children Erin Beto, Mary Makris and Tommy Breen; Cynthia's grandchildren William and Nolan Beto, Amelia and Walter Makris and Milo and Fiona Breen as well as Fred's daughter, Marybeth Brubaker.   As his grandson observed, Jake will see you all on the other side.

The State Water Transport Department’s (SWTD) fleet of single hull, slow- moving steel vessels that operate from the city to West Kochi and Vypeen will shortly be replaced with modern catamarans that are safer, faster and much more comfortable.
 The new vessels will have fibre-reinforced plastic (FRP) hull, which is popular worldwide. The catamaran (twin hull design) will provide them the much-needed stability. This will prevent frequent visits to the workshop to overcome corrosion that is a bane for steel vessels. They will also cause much less noise pollution and vibration, as compared to the vessels that operate now, said Shaji V. Nair, Director of the department.
 A pair of 100-seater catamaran ferries that were built as per Indian Register of Shipping (IRS) norms will be commissioned in Kochi in November. They will have two engines, to ensure their safety even if an engine develops snag. The vessels will also operate at upto 8 knots (around 15 km/hr) speed (as compared to existing vessels that operate at less than 10 km/hr speed), he added.
 The sole IRS-class vessel which was in operation in Kochi till the pandemic was Vega-120, SWTD’s fast ferry that operated in the Vaikom-Ernakulam-Fort Kochi route. It operated at more than double the speed of existing steel ferries.
 Another four catamaran FRP ferries with more of less similar specifications are being built at another yard in the suburbs of Kochi. One of them will be commissioned in December and a second in January 2021. The other two will follow suit.
 ## Solar tourist boat
 The department would also roll out its first solar-powered tourist boat in Kochi, by December end. “The catamaran vessel will be air-conditioned and have an upper deck for guests to have a sound view of the backwaters. We plan to launch it in December end,” Mr. Nair said.
 It operates two non-AC tourist services in the Alappuzha-Kollam route and in Kuttanad. Close on the heels of launching a water taxi service in Alappuzha on October 15, the department is readying to launch one such vessel in Kochi in November. It too will have solar panels on the roof, to provide energy for the electrical components. Guests will be able to rent out the 10-seater vessel.

England's lower league clubs have rejected the Premier League's offer of a £50 million ($64 million) rescue package aimed at easing the financial fallout from the coronavirus.


  The Premier League had agreed to offer the aid package to clubs in League One and League Two following government calls for top-flight teams to help less wealthy clubs.


  The £50 million deal would have been on top of £27.2 million already advanced by the Premier League to the lower leagues in the form of solidarity payments.


  But EFL chiefs announced on Thursday that the bailout was insufficient and insisted Championship clubs should also be included in any offer.


  The snub comes just 24 hours after Premier League clubs rejected the controversial 'Project Big Picture' plans proposed by Liverpool and Manchester United to drastically change the structure of the English game.


  "The need for continued unity across the membership base was fundamental to discussions across all three divisions, and therefore there was a strong consensus that any rescue package must meet the requirements of all 72 clubs before it can be considered in full," a statement on the EFL website said.


  "The League has been very clear in its discussions of the financial requirements needed to address lost gate receipts in 2019/20 and 2020/21, and while EFL clubs are appreciative that a formal proposal has now been put forward, the conditional offer of £50 million falls some way short of this.


  "The EFL is keen to continue discussions with the Premier League to reach an agreeable solution that will address the short-term financial needs of all of our clubs and allow us the ability to consider the longer-term economic issues in parallel that specifically look to achieve a more sustainable EFL for the future."


  In the Project Big Picture plan, which featured heavy involvement from Football League chairman Rick Parry, lower league teams would have received 25 percent of all future TV deals, plus a £250 million bailout.


  With matches likely to be played behind closed doors well into 2021 because of the pandemic, Preston advisor Peter Ridsdale has warned that some clubs in the lower leagues could fold by Christmas unless they get funding.

And a lot of times we're early in the trend and people don't always necessarily get it. So it doesn't always necessarily translate to dollars at that point. But then you look at it a year away from what we did, and usually, these brands that we work with become part of the culture in some way.

Cancel Thanksgiving? Fauci warns Americans may need to ‘bite the bullet’

We use our opinions and talking points as weapons of war against a dehumanized monster of a party and presidential candidate. We sharpen our tongue, the fierce tool we have to cut and slash our way through the perceived battle. And for us Christians, we’re actually living counter to the way that Jesus created and ushered in for us. Because of the inauguration of the kingdom of God through Jesus we’re given a new way to be human. And because of this new reality, we are to live into God’s vision for the world given through Isaiah: "They shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks” (Isaiah 2.4, NRSV).


  It’s time for us to make God's vision our own to find a new center and inertia from which to live. God is always working to correct our vision and our perception. Jesus, picking up the phrase from the prophets, said, “Whoever has ears, let them hear” (Matthew 13.9-16). From this new center, we are pulled out of the black hole sucking the life out of us to find a new way to live and be in the world as we strive with others to create a more perfect union. We need each other. We are not a collection of individual nomads. We are “the people.” We need each other to help not only hold our government (national, state and local) accountable, but we need those around us who see things differently to gently hold us in check. Without it, we end up living inside echo chambers that form us to be fragile.


  We’re invited to see the light that’s shining from outside the black hole. But we have to hear the gentle, still small voice of God’s kingdom calling us to be examples as salt and light to show the world where true identity comes from, where our wholeness and peace are found. Let it begin with us.

"Honestly, just because like everybody else I'm still trying to prove myself," Jackson told reporters during a videoconference Tuesday. "(Jackson's reaction) wasn't anything too big because I really haven't done anything . . . but it's just nice, honestly."


  Jackson started 10 games last season for Iowa (10-3), missing three contests with a knee injury. That prompted Jackson to decide against entering the 2020 NFL draft and remain at school for his senior season.


  "I'll be honest here, I wanted to leave . . . I want to get paid, honestly," Jackson said, matter-of-factly. "But I had an injury . . . so I decided to come back, and get healthy, have a better year and prove myself to everybody else."


  Jackson was included on the pre-season watch for this year's Outland Trophy, given annually to U.S. college football's top lineman. He's been projected by some as a guard in the NFL.


  "If they want me at guard, I'll play guard," he said. "If they want me to play tackle, I'll play tackle.


  "At the end of the day, I'm just trying to get paid."


  Like all sports leagues and organizations, the Big Ten Conference has been dramatically affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In August, the conference decided against playing football this year, only to have a change of heart and have its teams participate in an eight-game regular season.


  The Big Ten's reversal had no impact upon Jackson because he continued training throughout the process.


  "My whole idea on that was to stay in shape, keep working out," he said. "I didn't want to make any drastic choices just because things could change.


  "I just waited it out a bit, stayed here in Iowa City, trained every day and stayed in shape."


  Jackson has made one drastic change during the pandemic. In March, he switched to veganism to live a healthier lifestyle.


  "Honestly it was a big thing for me because it's not normal to be an offensive lineman and be a vegan," he said. "I got some jokes, which is fine, I enjoy it.


  ""Everybody was on board with it. They've seen how I move better, I'm a lot more capable of doing more things now (because) of my diet. Honestly, it was a good thing for me and the program. It's a big change, but it's a fun change."
