“We use open cell spray foam on all our timber frame constructions,” says Adrian. “Open cell foam is fast becoming Ireland's leading insulation material. It's famed for its air tight qualities and its ability to fill every nook and cranny. It's also designed to breathe. Using open cell spray foam on your timber frame construction is very cost effective, gives the customer great construction values, all with a breathable airtight seal. This will contribute to reducing people's heating bills, increasing the value of their home and creating a warm healthy living environment for their family or business.”

CYNTHIA ANN (HOLMES) OHLEN Blairstown Cynthia Ann (Holmes) Ohlen, 79, of Blairstown, died unexpectedly on Saturday, Nov. 21, 2020, at St. Luke's Hospital in Cedar Rapids. Private memorial services will be held at 10 a.m. Wednesday, Nov. 25, at Grace Lutheran Church in Blairstown with the Rev. Jeff Schanbacher officiating. Interment will be held at Pleasant Hill Cemetery in Blairstown. Because of COVID-19 concerns, the service will be livestreamed on the Grace Lutheran Church Blairstown Facebook page beginning at service time. Cynthia was born July 28, 1941, in Belle Plaine, to Charles and Orpha Augusta (Waterman) Holmes, their only child. Cynthia lived her first few years in Cedar Rapids, until her dad retired from Collins Radio to open a family business in Blairstown. Her parents owned and operated Holmes Sundries on Main Street, where the family lived above the store. She graduated from Blairstown High School in 1959, and shortly after, married her classmate William P. "Bill" Ohlen on June 4, 1960. Cynthia and Bill had three children, Todd, Kim and Julie, who she loved dearly. Later in life, she was blessed with five grandchildren, who all were truly her world. Cynthia enjoyed playing cards and board games with her family and friends, crocheting and music. God gave her the love of music and the gift to play piano and organ. With this gift, she played the organ at Grace Lutheran Church in Blairstown for many years and gave piano lessons to numerous children and adults in the community. For a good portion of Cynthia's career, she worked at the Marengo Printing Press (under several names) in the human resources department. She is survived by her son, Todd Ohlen (Sam Walker) of Naperville, Ill.; her daughters, Kim Ohlen (Tom Martin) of Cedar Rapids and Julie Lynn (Paul) of Victor; and five grandchildren, Colton, Mackenzie, Hunter, Dalton Lynn (Julie) and Megan Ohlen (Todd). She was preceded in death by her parents. Cynthia and her family will forever be grateful to the wonderful community of Blairstown and the great friends who gave of themselves and their time to help her along her journey. So many wonderful women and sometimes husbands who drove her to and from dialysis three times a week without fail. We love and thank you all. We are truly blessed. And a shout-out to River Valley Dialysis in Marengo and all their incredible hard-working and talented women who loved our mom and cared for her. All of you made her time during these days bearable. You are truly our heroes. Online condolences: www.phillipsfuneralhomes.com.

PAULINE FRANCES (MOORE) O'DONNELL Cedar Rapids Polly O'Donnell was born to Forest Moore and Theresa (Bender) Moore on April 3, 1924, in Keswick, Iowa. She dies Nov. 21, 2020. Her father died tragically a few months after she was born and her mother discovered that she was unable to provide for her and brought Polly to her parents who raised her in an outstanding climate of selfless love and devotion to family and God, which she came to model in her own family. Although raised until high school in the Armah community a couple of miles from Deep River, Iowa, she found plenty to keep her busy on the family farm. She moved with her grandparents to Marengo, where she began high school and played basketball at Marengo High School. She met Mell O'Donnell while attending high school and after high school moved to Cedar Rapids and rented a room close to St. Patrick Catholic Church and Quaker Oats, where she went to work. Soon after that, Mell, moved there too. They wed on Feb. 20, 1943, and started a family. They had nine children, six boys and three girls. Home life always had been one of Polly's greatest joys. What the family lacked in material things was never the focal point of home. The simple chores of being a housewife and a mother were performed with the most genuine love imaginable, as if she were setting the stage for a huge production, and all acts of love signified the oneness of our family unit and the great majesty with which she served us! Everything she did was majestic! No task was too great or too small. At about 2:30 p.m. she would begin baking either a "made from scratch" chocolate cake, cherry pie or our cookie favorites. The aroma would waft through the neighborhood as we approached the front door after school. Once home, the boys enjoyed shooting hoops, until the call for supper came. We would see a very tempting well-prepared meal as each of us filed in from outside after some after-school playtime. Mom would send them to wash up, sometimes change their shirts as they had given way to visible grass-stains and comb their hair before coming to the table which began with grace. After supper and dishes were done, we said the family rosary. Then off to the basement to wash another day's laundry and hang it on basement clotheslines to dry overnight. If it were the night of a storm sometime between bedtime and dawn, we would feel drops of holy water sprinkled on our heads during the night by our guardian angel, Our Mom! Polly's survivors include her children, Karen Swindler, Dan O'Donnell, Angie (Tim) Casey, Pat (Kathleen) O'Donnell, Mell (Lori) O'Donnell, Tom (Cheryl) O'Donnell, Tim O'Donnell, Mike (Shelly) O'Donnell and Coleen (Tom) Stevenson; 22 grandkids; 31 great-grandkids; and seven great-great-grandkids. Her husband, Mell; son-in-law, Les Swindler; and granddaughter, Claire Stevenson, preceded her in death A private family funeral Mass will be held at 11 a.m. Saturday, Nov. 28. Friends and extended family are invited to watch the Mass via livestream. Please find the livestream link on Polly's tribute wall and share your support and memories with her family at www.stewartbaxter.com under obituaries. Private family burial will follow at Mount Calvary Cemetery, Cedar Rapids. Arrangements are with Stewart Baxter Funeral & Memorial Services, Cedar Rapids. Donations may be directed to Immaculate Conception Catholic Church, Cedar Rapids.

Though Get Tasty is an almost infinitely replayable mode, it still stings that there’s no single-player campaign. Cake Bash is a game that thrives around couch co-op, and at the time of this review, that’s incredibly infeasible for most people. However, the developers had the foresight to include online play, which is close enough for the time being. Unfortunately, Cake Bash does not currently support cross-console online play, but players still have the option of making friend lobbies or searching for random opponents who also own the game on Nintendo Switch. A fair warning, however: match”caking” as the game so cutely calls it, takes longer than one would expect, so try to group up with some buddies if you can. Connections are pretty stable with online opponents, but I have been the victim of being randomly booted out of lobbies on rare occasions.

India's two-wheeler exports will see sustained growth in the second half of next fiscal after witnessing temporary hurdles in the first half this year due to Covid-19 and weakened crude oil prices, hurting the economies of key exporting destinations, according to ratings agency Ind- Ra.Exports momentum is expected to continue in the remaining part of FY21 and FY22, primarily driven by the exporting countries' lower penetration level, demand for usage as commercial fleet, stability in crude prices, lack of public infrastructure and aversion to public transport amid Covid-19, India Ratings and Research said in a statement.India exports two-wheelers mainly to African, Asian and Latin American countries, constituting 37.5 per cent, 22.9 per cent and 21.4 per cent, respectively, during the first half of FY21, it added."Within this, Nigeria, Colombia, Nepal, Bangladesh and Philippines together accounted for around 50 per cent of the total exports in FY20 (in terms of value)," the rating agency said.Indian original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) will continue to gain traction for their key offering on the back of their strong market position and robust distribution network, it added.Indian two-wheeler manufacturers such as Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor Co will benefit from their exports-focused business model, with almost 49 per cent and 26 per cent, respectively, of their total sales volume in the first half of FY21 coming from exports, it said.However, Indian OEMs face tough competition, particularly from Japanese OEMs that have a strong market share globally. Though Chinese OEMs have a higher market share than Indian OEMs in the global markets, the competition is fragmented and Indian OEMs have superior quality, the agency noted.Ind-Ra said it expects the two-wheeler (2W) exports decline for FY21 to be in line with that of the domestic industry at 18-21 per cent."Since 2W exports only account for 16-18 per cent of the total 2W sales for Indian OEMs, this is not likely to be substantial enough to compensate for the domestic volumes during the same period," it added.2W export volumes are likely to increase by mid-teens in FY22, the ratings agency said.The industry faced temporary hiccups in the first quarter of FY21 due to the Covid-19 spread as well as weakened crude oil prices, hurting the economies of key exporting destinations for India."This coupled with the nationwide lockdown, supply-chain and logistics disruptions impacted export sales significantly," Ind-Ra said.Since then India's 2W exports have moved in line with growth in domestic markets, it added.

Il recupero segnato dall'economia italiana in estate, ricorda Bankitalia, ''è stato superiore a quanto previsto'' e ''indica che la nostra economia conserva una significativa capacità di recupero e conferma l'importanza del sostegno fornito dalla politica economica''. Tuttavia, avverte palazzo Koch, ''la recrudescenza della pandemia osservata nelle ultime settimane e le misure di contenimento adottate dal governo si stanno ripercuotendo sull'economia. Gli indicatori più recenti suggeriscono che in Italia, come nell'area dell'euro, è in corso un indebolimento dell'attività economica''. Nel quarto trimestre, quindi, ''è plausibile si osservi una flessione del pil, anche se più contenuta di quella primaverile. È probabile che il risultato per l'anno risulti comunque in linea con quanto prefigurato in ottobre''. Le prospettive, secondo Bankitalia, ''restano condizionate, oltre che dai progressi nel controllo dei contagi, dalla prontezza ad adattare l'azione di politica economica all'evolversi della situazione''. Le valutazioni fornite un mese fa, circa gli effetti macroeconomici dei programmi del Governo, ''rimangono complessivamente confermate alla luce delle misure in discussione'', afferma Gaiotti. L'impatto espansivo prefigurato in ottobre dal Governo, secondo Bankitalia, ''appare coerente con una composizione degli interventi in cui abbiano ampio spazio il sostegno agli investimenti privati e gli investimenti pubblici''. Tuttavia, avverte via Nazionale, ''la possibilità di ottenere pieni benefici dagli interventi, che si estendano anche al medio termine, dipende dalla effettiva definizione dei progetti di riforma e investimento, dalla misura in cui saranno in grado di dare luogo a una espansione del potenziale di crescita del paese e dalla rapidità con cui saranno attuati''. Ma ''l'impulso esercitato'' dalla legge di bilancio 2021 sarà pari a ''2 punti di pil l'anno'' nel 2021 e nel 2022; mentre per il 2023 scenderà a 1,3 punti, afferma ancora Gaiotti. Le coperture delle misure contenute nel ddl sono ''rappresentate per tre quarti da aumenti di spesa'', aggiunge. Ma ''è indispensabile affiancare alle misure per far fronte agli eventi emergenziali, misure di più ampio respiro per tornare a crescere stabilmente a ritmi sostenuti''. ''Assicurare l'efficacia dei provvedimenti di sostegno alla crescita, di cui si comincia a discutere con questa manovra e poi nel pnr, è forse il requisito più importante'' per una ''discesa progressiva e significativa del debito'', afferma ancora il capo del dipartimento Economia e statistica della Banca d'Italia. E' necessaria ''una riforma organica'' del fisco, che passi da una ''revisione del sistema fiscale, che ricomponga il carico fiscale a beneficio dei fattori produttivi, e tenga conto delle modifiche che hanno interessato il sistema dei trasferimenti sociali'', sottolinea ancora. Si tratta di ''un passo importante, la cui attuazione richiederà particolare cura nel valutare gli effetti distributivi e quelli sulle decisioni di lavoro e di consumo delle famiglie, nonché sulle scelte di investimento delle imprese'', spiega Gaiotti. Quanto all'introduzione del nuovo assegno universale per i figli ''è un istituto importante perché rivolto a tutti i nuclei familiari, incluse diverse categorie di lavoratori autonomi e le famiglie fiscalmente incapienti, oggi escluse dai benefici di molti degli strumenti''. Bankitalia segnala, però, ''l'opportunità di contenere gli effetti di disincentivo all'offerta di lavoro, che potrebbero derivare dall'utilizzo dell'Isee come indicatore per quantificare l'ammontare del beneficio''. Inoltre andrebbe corretta ''la penalizzazione per i figli dei nuclei familiari numerosi beneficiari del Reddito di cittadinanza, con il quale l'assegno sarà congiuntamente erogato''.
