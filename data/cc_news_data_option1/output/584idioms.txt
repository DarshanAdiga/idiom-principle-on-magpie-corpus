In our forecast, put in a similar level for the possibility of it continuing on from Q3 probably -- fairly at the level we experienced in Q3. At the end of the day, the Q4 large claim activity came in just very slightly ahead of that forecast that we incorporated into the Q4 numbers. Yes, the frequency came down some, but the total cost it didn't move very much.

The invasive species Oregon Grape is an evergreen shrub that may reach 4 to 6 feet in height and 3 to 4 feet in width. This shrub has large, pinnately compound leaves with 9 to 13 spiny leaflets. The shrub is multi-stemmed and the bark is corky. Fragrant, yellow flowers appear in winter. Small, black fruits hang in grape-like clusters and mature in May and June. Oregon Grape likes to take root in partial shade and moist soils. This invasive shrub colonizes by seeds that are dispersed by birds and mammals.

With the growth of the electrical & electronics industry across the globe, the demand for materials involved in the manufacturing of electrical & electronics products is also increasing. Increasing demand for Polyphenylene Sulfide (PPS) resins for the manufacturing of switches, connectors, etc. is expected to drive the growth of global Polyphenylene Sulfide market. Along with this, increasing use of Polyphenylene Sulfide resins in the automotive industry is another factor driving the growth of the market. Moreover, rising demand for Polyphenylene Sulfide resins for industrial filtration & filter bags application is expected to boost the demand further. That aside, growing demand for high temperature flame resistant coatings is another factor responsible for growth of global PPS market. However, availability of substitutes such as PEI and PEEK as well as instability of raw materials prices may hamper the growth of the global Polyphenylene Sulfide resins market during the forecast period. Comparatively high cost of Polyphenylene Sulfide resins has significantly affected the growth of this market. Also, Polyphenylene Sulfide resins are relatively more difficult to process due to their higher melting points as well as the fillers required to get desired impact strength and this might weight heavily on the PPS market in the long run.

The restart of business poses a risk of further spreading the virus, but China has little recourse, said Cong Liang, secretary general of the National Development and Reform Commission, the country's main economic planning body.
 “Without the reopening of businesses, in the short term, it will affect the supply of medical material and ... in the long run, it will affect the supply of all kinds of production and life materials and will make the control and prevention efforts on the front line unsustainable. The target of defeating the epidemic will not be reached,” Cong said at a news conference.
 In Hong Kong, authorities evacuated part of an apartment block after cases among its residents raised suspicion the virus may be spreading through the building's plumbing. Three residents in one apartment were confirmed to have the virus days after a resident who lives 10 floors above them.
 During the 2002-03 outbreak of SARS, an illness caused by a related virus, a number of infections in Hong Kong were linked to one building's sewage pipes.
 Hong Kong has confirmed 49 cases in the current outbreak.
 Postal operators in the United States, China, Singapore and elsewhere said the suspension of flights to slow the virus spread was having a major impact on the global flow of letters and parcels.
 The United States Postal Service informed its counterparts around the world on Tuesday that it was “experiencing significant difficulties” in dispatching letters, parcels and express mail to China, including Hong Kong and Macau, because airlines have suspended flights to those destinations.
 It said the USPS said can no longer accept items destined for China “until sufficient transport capacity becomes available.”
 The Universal Postal Union, a U.N. agency for postal co-operation between its 192 member countries, said the flight suspensions would impact mail delivery “for the foreseeable future.”
 The Chinese mail service, China Post, said it was disinfecting postal offices, processing centres and vehicles to ensure the virus doesn't spread via the mail and to protect postal staff.
 The virus does “not survive for long on objects. It is therefore safe to receive postal items from China," China Post said.

She's drawn international attention and ire as an expert witness for the defense in the trials of divisive figures such as OJ Simpson, Ted Bundy, Michael Jackson and, just days ago, Harvey Weinstein.
 But she and her team wanted to look at how weed, used by some 183 million peple worldwide, might affect memory and testimony, too.
 They recruited 64 adults to test the effects of cannabis.
 Half were given a controlled dose of marijuana, while the other half got a placebo.
 All participants were then subjected to two experiments.
 In the first, they were given a list of related words to remember.
 Shortly thereafter they were asked if a certain words were on the original list of 15.
 Those who had used weed were far more likely to falsely recall words as being in their initial set that were not, in fact.
 In the second experiment, each participant wore a virtual reality headset. In one experiences, they committed a crime, and in the other, they were witnesses to a crime - a railway station fight.
 Immediately afterwards, everyone was questioned about what they did and saw.
 People that were high falsely recalled details of the experiences that hadn't occurred or been present at a much higher rates than their sober counterparts did.
 Encouragingly, everyone's recall a week later was imperfect, but about equally so.
 'Our findings show that it would be better for police officers and investigators to postpone the questioning of eyewitnesses and suspects who are under the influence of cannabis until they are sober,' said study co-author, Jan Ramaekers.
 'People under the influence of cannabis should actually be treated as a vulnerable group in a criminal investigation, comparable with children and the elderly.'

While feeling much better, I still wasn’t 100%. He suggested next time I try a hot toddy.
 The hot toddy — the simple hot cocktail consisting of hot water, honey, lemon and brown liquor — like chicken soup, has long been touted as a remedy for the common cold. But when I’m feeling awful, alcohol is the last thing I want to consume. That’s why I had never tried a hot toddy when feeling under the weather — until I got another cold a few months later.
 Before I had another restless night, I decided to give the hot toddy a try.
 My skepticism quickly faded. It seemed to work better than any of the over- the-counter products I had tried. I slept through the night.
 While it was no cure, it temporarily relieved my symptoms, which may make some sense, says Donald Hensrud, a physician in internal medicine who also serves as an associate professor of nutrition and preventive medicine at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science.

 Clayton Holley punished the nets with 23 points to provide the main thrust to the 15th win for the Wesleyan Christian School boys' basketball team.
   
 Levi Harper added 15 points in the 63-52 win Friday against Dove Science.
   
 "We had a big run in the third quarter," veteran WCS head coach Kameron Nettleton said. "We ended up getting up by 20 points. They kind of came back in the fourth. But, we led by 10 or 11 most the quarter."
   
 Rounding out the Mustangs' scoring sheet were Kade Kelley, seven points; Tyler Heck, six points; Parker Francis, four points; Preston Francis, four points; Tyler Orphin, two points; and Daniel Marquez, two points.
   
 In addition to balanced scoring, "we did a good job rebounding as a team," Nettleton said. "Levi and Tyler did a really good job rebounding. We pretty much limited them to one shot."
   
 With a stellar 15-5 mark, the Mustangs finish up the regular season Tuesday against Mingo Valley.
   
 A team-first attitude is the catalyst to the Mustangs' success.
   
 "Really, they've been playing as a group," Nettleton said. "Everyone kind of knows their role and knows what to expect. … They seem to respond to that."
   
 Copan takes 2
   
 With just one more regular season tune-up remaining prior to plunge into the playoffs , the host Copan High School basketball teams sharpened their claws Friday against Foyil High School.
   
 In the boys' game, the Copan Hornets (8-13) whittled out a 56-53 victory -- which halted a nine-game losing streak.
   
 The Lady Hornets (10-11) had a little easier time, slicing to a 52-40 triumph.
   
 Copan closed out its regular season slate Monday night. The Hornets and Lady Hornets travel Friday to Garber for the Class A district playoffs.
   
 Following are summaries of Friday's wins:
   
 Copan girls win, 52-40
   
 Skylar Odum and Carli Barnett scored 14 and 12 points, respectively, to lead the Lady Hornets.
   
 Sarah Gilliland added 11 points, followed by Abbey Davis with seven, Tatum Williams with five and Faith Weatherspoon with three.
   
 Odum accumulated eight steals while Barnett blocked six sots.
   
 Copan pulled away in the third quarter, 16-4, and cruised through the final period.
   
 "A win is always good," Copan head coach Kristy Bryan said. "Our record may not reflect what kind of team we are because we had to play bigger schools."
   
 Copan boys win, 56-53
   
 Correll Record and Tyreek Millien skinned the nets for 18 and 13 points, respectively, to give Copan a one-two punch to keep the Panthers backed up on the ropes.
   
 But, the Hornets also got solid scoring support from the rest of its crew -- Colton Brizendine, eight points, Kolby Mackey, seven points; Boston Mackey, five points; and Wyatt Davis, five points.
   
 "It was kind of a chess match," Copan head coach Kevin Foreman said.. "We were trying to get up and down the floor and they were slowing down a little bit on us and trying to make it a halfcourt game."
   
 Copan hitched a ride on the Momentum Express to go ahead by 10 points, but Foyil scratched back to within four points.
   
 "We hit our free throws late," Foreman said. "Tyreek hit 3-of-4 to salt it away. We played pretty good defense down the stretch. … It was a fun game, it really was. Those close ones are what you live for."
   
 Copan understands what it's like to be on the opposite side of the stomach churners -- the Hornets have endured five single-digit losses.
   
 OUHS girls outlast CV
   
 Delayed offense proved to be too big a detriment Friday night for the Caney Valley High School girls' basketball team.
   
 Oklahoma Union High bolted to a 12-4 lead in the first quarter and went on to win by six, 47-41, to complete a rare season sweep (3-0) of the Caney Valley Lady Trojans.
   
 "After the first quarter our offense showed up," said Lady Trojan head coach Deric Longan. "But, the last time we played them, our offense didn't show up the whole game. We shot the ball well the last three quarters."
   
 Paige Urquhart drained 16 points to paced Caney Valley's attack, followed by Hanna Jones with seven and Joanna Guevara with five. Sammi Gilbreath and Jill Emery added four points apiece. Jade Upton and Gentry Webb contributed three and two points, respectively.
   
 Chesnie Hewitt hammered home 17 points for Oklahoma Union, which remained nearly perfect at 18-1.
   
 But, the Lady Trojans gave a valiant effort to try to hand the Lady Cougars loss No. 2.
   
 "In the fourth quarter, we took a lead briefly but they went on an 8-0 run to end the game," Longan said. "It was kind of like our first meeting, a really close, a really competitive game."
   
 The Lady Trojans have fashioned a winning record (10-9), during what some might label as a rebuilding year.
   
 "The seniors have carried the bulk of the scoring, but our young kids have played pretty well," Longan said. "We have several good juniors who have stepped up and played good minutes."
   
 Caney Valley plays host to Nowata on Tuesday and journeys on Valentine's Day to Dewey.
   
 Oklahoma Union travels Tuesday to Ketchum.
   
 Nowata boys win
   
 One might be able to lock the barn door, but the Chelsea Green Dragons had no clue as to how to shut the door on Barnes.
   
 Dillon Barnes dialed in 27 points -- his career high -- to energize the Nowata Ironmen past Chelsea, 66-51, in boys basketball action Friday at Chelsea.
   
 Barnes' scoring frenzy came on top of a 25-point output against Copan in the previous game.
   
 "Dillon has been real unselfish all year," veteran Nowata head coach Gary Hollingshed said. "He hit a couple of threes and he's been driving the ball well lately and getting inside."
   
 Mark Price added 13 points, followed by Gabe Velasco with eight, to round out Nowata's top three scorers.
   
 "We had a comfortable lead throughout," said Hollingshed, who saw his team improve to 17-3. "We really didn't play as fast as we have all year. We switched up defenses and stuff."
   
 When it comes to defensive prowess and grit, no one outscraps Josiah Clark.
   
 "He's been playing really good on defense," Hollingshed said. "He's able to get a lot of rebounds. Nobody has caused more turnovers than he has caused."
   
 Hollingshed has the Ironmen focusing on rebounding and halfcourt defense as they head into next week's playoffs.
   
 Woodland downs Barnsdall
   
 Points came painfully slow in the first half for Woodland and Barnsdall high schools.
   
 But, the girls' basketball squads combined for 52 points in the final two quarters as Woodland pulled out the 45-39 victory at Barnsdall.
   
 The game had been knotted, 16-16, at halftime.
   
 "We didn't play all that bad except we had some key turnovers late in the game that kind of hurt us," Barnsdall head coach Joe Gilbert said. "Basically, throughout the game we played pretty decent. … We played pretty good defense."
   
 Barnsdall shot better than usual -- approximately 30 percent from the field and 75 percent from the free throw line, the veteran coach said.
   
 Mickey Easley turned in a dynamic effort, with 14 points and six steals, for Barnsdall.
   
 Jaydon Mackey added six rebounds and four points.
   
 Rachel Bennett drained 12 points for Woodland.
   
 "If we could have just kept from turning the ball over late we'd have given ourselves a shot of beating them," Gilbert said. "I'm pretty proud of the way my kids again looked better."

 Cougars put up 105
   
 This season's Oklahoma Union High School's boys basketball has amazed a lot of people.
   
 Even their own head coach.
   
 Following a 40-point eruption in the third period last Friday, Cougar head coach Lee Ott shook his head in amazement.
   
 "By the end of the quarter, Brad (assistant head coach Brad Hall) and I looked at each other and I asked, 'did we just score 40 points in a quarter?" Ott said.
   
 That super-charged stanza helped carry the Cougars (18-1) to a 105-55 victory at home against the Caney Valley Trojans.
   
 This was the second time this season the Cougars -- ranked No. 1 in the state in Class 2A -- scored in triple-digits, and the seventh time they've finished above 90 points.
   
 OKWU drilled 17 three-pointers to account for almost half their points on Friday.
   
 Kohlsyn Gibson led the way with seven treys and 29 points.
   
 Jace Gilmore added 20 points, followed by Kade Hollingshed with 17 and Dillon Ellis with 14.
   
 Ott admitted his team's explosive offensive ability this season cannot be wholly explained with words.
   
 "The whole second half, Brad and I sat down and let them play," he added.
   
 Caney Valley brought plenty of determination into the fight and "they didn't back down," Ott said. "We just answered everything they had."
   
 Heading into the second half, "they did not have the same energy we came out with," Ott said.
   
 The Cougars finish up with three games this week and then play host next week in the district playoffs. Mounds and Barnsdall will round out the district.

Take it or leave it; visiting a country like Vietnam is not always a luxury trip; instead, it is an adventure journey, and as such, you'll always need your backpack. Considering all the walking, hiking, biking, and traveling you will be doing, the last thing you want to forget at home is a thick-strapped backpack to carry all your belongings, including a change of clothes, water bottle, mobile phone, smart gadgets, sunglasses, snacks, and even sunscreen. But that's not even all; it is very unlikely that you'll go through a day – irrespective of the part of Vietnam you choose to explore – in the country without finding a thing or two to purchase, whether for yourself or your loved ones at home and when you finally do, you'll need a place to safely keep them, this is where your backpack comes in handy again.

Recap and analysis of the week in state government
 Joint Rule 10 was made to be broken, or at least danced around.
 The biennial deadline for almost all legislative committees to make recommendations on the hundreds of bills put in their tender care arrived on Wednesday, a wonk-a-palooza for Beacon Hill Kremlinologists giddy at the prospect of trying to read the tea leaves and suss out the agenda for the next six months.
 As rules go, this committee reporting deadline has been one less susceptible to being suspended, or worse, ignored. But that doesn't mean it's hard and fast.
 So while former Gov. Mitt Romney was making history on the Senate floor in Washington, becoming a trivia question answer as the only senator to ever vote to remove a president of his own party, Democratic committee chairs at his former work address were busy preparing extension orders.
 Committees that needed or wanted more time to make a decision on bills simply asked for it. But they had to be specific.
 Rep. Ann-Margaret Ferrante and Sen. Eric Lesser, for instance, filed an order seeking an extension until just Feb. 28 for their Economic Development Committee to make a recommendation on sports betting, breeding optimism for some that the issue could soon move off the back burner.
 On the other hand, the Joint Committee on Labor and Workforce Development - still lacking a House chairman - filed an order to take until June 5 to decide on wage theft legislation.
 But while the clerks were busy processing extension orders, some committees did render verdicts. Hundreds, if not thousands, of bills were referred for further study, effectively killing them off until the next two-year session when they must be refiled and the process starts again.
 Among those for which the bell tolled was Gov. Charlie Baker's often talked about "drugged-driving" bill, which presented a potential roadmap for police to deal with drivers behind the wheel and under the influence of marijuana, but who can't be tested like they can for alcohol impairment.
 Baker has said impaired driving must be addressed before the Legislature considers authorizing social consumption at pot cafes, so maybe legislative Democrats were sending a message on both fronts. It wasn't all bad news for Baker's priority legislation, though.
 The Transportation Committee was one of the few that showed itself to be ready to move forward, at least on the governor's $18 billion bond bill to fund road, bridge and public transit projects across the state for years to come.
 "We're happy to report we stuck to the $18 billion number," Sen. Joseph Boncore said. "I think that was the most critical thing. The bond bill makes crucial investments in future transportation infrastructure projects that every one of our districts needs and it was the Senate's priority to ensure that bond bill remained at the same number as the governor, $18 billion."
 He refused to say it outright, but this was not the first time Boncore strongly hinted that the House had tried to pare back the size of the bond bill, and people in the Senate and the Baker administration have been whispering for weeks about how the House might be trying to shrink the scope of bill as a way to help make their case for more tax revenues for transportation.
 The Transportation Committee also recommended a bill that would allow undocumented immigrants to obtain a standard state driver's license, provided they can show certain documentation to prove their identity. Intended as a public safety measure, it's the first time it has ever advanced from committee, but Baker said he still can't support it, holding to his position from the 2014 campaign and one he has repeated over the years.
 The news on his bond bill came after Baker earlier in the week gave a speech to the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce urging both patience with the MBTA and transit improvements, and then claiming to have none.
 "But it will be disruptive and it will require a certain amount of patience," he said. "I don't have any patience for this. I would like it to all be here by tomorrow. But I've also learned to understand, when you're working on an operating system, it's a little more complicated."
 It might have been a mixed message, but the point was made. To quote Sam Cooke: It's been a long time coming, but a change is going to come.
 The governor demonstrated what he was talking about in that speech later in the week when he announced in Brookline that all five main MBTA lines and parts of the commuter rail will see shutdowns in 2020 to facilitate repair work, including month-long closures on both the Green Line's C and E branches.
 One thing the transportation bond bill won't fund is East-West Rail. Certainly not if it costs $25 billion.
 A report released by MassDOT estimated that extending rail service from Boston to Springfield could cost anywhere from $2 billion to $25 billion. And depending on how it's done, a train could shuttle passengers between the edges of the state in between two to four hours.
 Some advocates, including Sen. Eric Lesser, were left disappointed by the report, believing that it low-balled the potential ridership demand for expanded service and failed to take into full account the positive economic impact it could have.
 The report, however, won't be the last word on East-West Rail, particularly as regional equity figures to feature heavily in a looming transportation revenue debate.
 Speaking of equity, Senate President Karen Spilka and Sen. Julian Cyr used their personal brushes with mental health challenges to make the case for a sweeping mental health care reform bill released last week.
 For Spilka, it was her father who suffered after World War II and wouldn't get help. For Cyr, he said he struggled with depression and anxiety but had trouble getting insurance to pay for the therapy that worked for him.
 While mental health parity has been the law of the health care land since 2000, Spilka and Sen. Cindy Freidman said the reality has been anything but equality in care.
 The bill would, among its many provisions, give the state new ways to enforce parity and tries to remove insurance companies from mental health care decisions that should, senators said, be made between a patient and their doctor.
 The Senate will debate the bill Thursday, the second of three major health care reform bills Spilka said she wants to pass this session following last year's prescription drug cost legislation.
 The House hasn't taken up any health care legislation so far this session, but on Feb. 5 it did debate a request the Cannabis Control Commission has been making for explicit authority to review and enforce host community agreements between municipalities and marijuana businesses.
 The request came amid complaints from some in the cannabis industry that cities and towns were extorting them for concessions on revenue and benefits unallowed by state law.
 There may have been disagreement at some point over whether the legislature had intended to give CCC the authority it sought in the original pot law, but there's no question now where the House stands.
 Another week and still no white smoke on the transportation revenue plan from House leaders, and if they wait much longer they may have a new member here in time to vote.

The month of February means it's time for the Marshfield hockey team to take its next step forward.
 A year ago the Rams played some of the top teams in Eastern Mass to earn the ninth-seed in the Super Eight Hockey Tournament. They defeated eighth-seed St. Mary's of Lynn to get into the double-elimination tournament, but lost their next two games.
 Marshfield, which is playing an independent schedule this year before entering the Patriot League as an official member in the 2020-21 school year has a tough month of February.
 They played Xaverian, which is being considered for the Super Eight and Waltham which is one of the top teams in Div.1 North. The Rams will also face Falmouth, Barnstable and Walpole, both tournament teams.
 There is one hope for the 7-6-4 Rams in the final month of the regular season.
 "Knock on wood, we only need three points to qualify for the tournament," Marshfield Head Coach Dan Connolly said. "Hopefully, our best hockey is ahead of us. We tinkered with some lines, defensive formations and different forechecks during the season to try to get everyone on the same page for the final weeks of the regular season."
 "We are playing well. We have been playing three lines that have been playing well. We lost to Xaverian, 4-2, but it was an even game. We have a good stretch of games coming up."
 Sophomore Nick Souretis scored his eighth goal and senior Griffin Mudge added his seventh goal in the loss to Xaverian.
 Souretis added his ninth goal in the first period of the 5-2 loss to Waltham. Matt Mullaney also scored a goal for the Rams.
 "The shots in the game were even in the game," Connolly said. "They (Xaverian) have one of the better lines in state and Waltham is a tournament-bound team."
 "Griffin and Nick are both playing well as is (senior) Tim Doyle."
 The good thing heading into the final stretch of the season is that the Rams are getting strong play from a young back line.
 Marshfield had graduated heavily from the defensive end last season.
 "Jon Jordan and Charlie Kolar are our only seniors on defense," Connolly said. "We play a junior, two sophomores and a freshman on defense. Our senior goalie Aidan Healy is playing very well.
 "It has been a team effort for us. The forwards are getting back and helping out defensively."
 The Rams traveled to Falmouth Wednesday and have a 3:30 p.m. date at the Hobomock Arena Saturday against Plymouth South. They finish up with Walpole (Feb. 17) and then have two games in the Coach Melchiano Showdown. They play Barnstable on Feb.19 and a team TBA the next day. The tourney pairings will be announced on Feb. 21.
 Connolly likes what he sees from Marshfield's future home in the Patriot League.
 "It is a good competitive league," Connolly said. "There is a lot of balance in the league and you can see that by the amount of ties there has been. They will have a lot of the top teams in the tournament in both Div. 2 and Div.3."

So it's not to say that there won't be changes in the competitive context et cetera.

We introduced a number of alerting features to help our customers understand what they're being charged and when, which had a direct impact. We forecast at that time that 275 would grow to 415. We've seen that flow through. And we feel like there's some modest growth opportunities, which is really just a function of growth from here.

Typically, these receptors are used to graft the specificity of a monoclonal antibody onto a T-cell, with transfer of their coding sequence facilitated by retroviral vectors. The receptors are called chimeric because they are composed of parts from different sources.

TORONTO — Nick Nurse's ability to roll with the roster punches goes back to his D League days, when he rarely knew from one game to the next which players he'd have in uniform.
 And so it wasn't surprising that Nurse met Tuesday's news that Serge Ibaka was sick with a shrug, and a quick adjustment.
 Nurse and the Toronto Raptors have made adjusting on the fly an art form this season, rolling to a franchise-record and league-leading 15 consecutive victories despite being among the league's top five teams in games lost to injuries.
 "We haven't played great all the time (during this streak), but we keep finding a way and that's a heck of a characteristic to have," Nurse said.
 The Raptors beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 137-126 on Monday for their 15th consecutive win. That topped the Calgary Stampeders, who won 14 straight in 2016, for the longest single-season win streak from a major Canadian-based professional team (NBA, NHL, MLB, CFL and MLS).
 The Raptors are 40-14, a franchise record for 54 games despite the mounting injuries and losing superstar Kawhi Leonard and starter Danny Green to free agency in the summer, and go for No. 16 when they play the Nets (24-28) on Wednesday in Brooklyn.
 But don't mention "streak" to the players, who've said it's been tough to avoid with all the social media buzz.
 "Day by day man," Kyle Lowry said after a recent win. "Day by day, game by game, hour by hour, minute by minute. We don't think about no streaks, we just think about the next game."
 Among the players who've missed chunks of this streak: Lowry, Fred VanVleet, Norman Powell, Marc Gasol and Patrick McCaw. Powell (broken finger) and Gasol (hamstring strain) aren't expected to return until after this weekend's all- star break at least.
 Ibaka's absence Monday to illness was unexpected. But the Raptors have mastered the next-man-up game, and so in the absence of its two centres — Ibaka and Gasol — the Raptors started Rondae Hollis-Jefferson who gave up six inches to the Minnesota's Karl-Anthony Towns.
 "We didn't have a whole lot of other options," Nurse said on the last-minute adjustment.
 While the Raptors have been effective at making in-game adjustments, Nurse chalks up much of the win streak to hustle.
 "I think these guys have proven enough that they can win," he said. "We've have a lot of injuries this year, but they just keep stepping up and playing and we've just gotten used to it. You at least have to go out and give a great effort, give yourself a chance to win, and don't let them play harder than you. If you think you're under-talented or undersized or whatever, then you’ve got to take your energy and toughness up a notch and think we've done that most nights."
 There's an aura of confidence around the players that is partly a holdover from last season's historic post-season run.
 "I think it's in the players right?" Nurse said. "They come out and they take it to you, from Kyle to Pascal (Siakam) and Fred, all the way to Rondae, OG (Anunoby), Pat, Terence (Davis). Lots of guys come out there and try to execute the offence the best they can and take what's there. They find a mismatch and they go to it, over and over. Try to guard people. They might think somebody is too short, too slow, but they go out and give the effort."
 Raptors fans were in an uproar when Davis was left off the roster for the this weekend's Rising Stars game as part of the annual NBA All-Star festivities.
 The undrafted rookie has scored in double figures in four of the Raptors' last five games, including a career-high 31-point performance against Chicago.
 Davis was trending on Twitter on Tuesday thanks to outraged Raptors fans after the league announced Colin Sexton had been named an injury replacement for Tyler Herro on the U.S. Rising Stars team.
 This report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 11, 2020.

 “Everything about that firearm is dangerous,” Mowery said, adding later, “It was incredibly likely that someone was going to be injured.”
 Someone was, as Mowery described the wound as a 3-inch hole to the neck and collarbone area of the victim. Moved just slightly in any direction, the wound likely would have been instantly or near-instantly fatal.
 Gibson was designated as a high risk to reoffend in a pre-sentence investigation and Mowery asked for a maximum sentence.
 Based on the terms of the please, the Level 5 and Level 6 felony counts would be served consecutively instead of concurrently, creating a possible maximum of six years for the handgun charge and 2 1/2 years for the criminal recklessness.
 On a redirect, Fumarolo noted that while the sawed-off gun in the incident was not owned by Gibson, he did illegally possess it the night of the shooting.
 When given off to Kramer, the judge found far more aggravating circumstances than mitigating.
 Kramer gave weight to mitigating factors including Gibson’s remorse and credit for taking the victim to the hospital, but those were outnumbered by aggravating factors including use of a firearm, serious bodily injury, Gibson’s long criminal history and that fact that Gibson was self-admittedly high on methamphetamine at the time of the incident.
 Gibson has also previously been sentenced to probation four times before and violated and had his probation revoked all four times.
 “This is, I don’t know how it could get more dangerous,” Kramer said. “You do pose a danger to the safety of the community.”
 With that, Kramer sentenced Gibson to a maximum sentence of 8 1/2 years total in the case. That sentence will run consecutive to a two-year probation sentence in a second case — which Kramer noted had it not been stipulated as probation in the plea it likely would have been more time behind bars due to his “horrible history on probation.”
 The sentences will also run concurrent to any sentences handed out in another pending Noble County case, to time Gibson is currently serving in Allen County and to a pending matter in DeKalb County.
 Gibson was also ordered to pay $384,338 in restitution to the victim for medical bills and other expenses incurred due to the shooting, as well as $250 restitution in the second case.

In a new court filing, a Justice Department official who had not previously worked on the case called that recommendation "excessive and unwarranted" and said the department would not make a formal sentencing recommendation.
 Democrats blasted the department's shift in the high-profile case involving Stone, whose friendship with Trump dates back decades. Stone's trial arose from former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation that detailed extensive Russian interference in the 2016 election to benefit Trump's candidacy.
 Trump told reporters he thought the initial recommendation was "ridiculous" but said he did not speak to the Justice Department about it.
 "I'd be able to do it if I wanted. I have the absolute right to do it. I stay out of things," Trump said.
 The four prosecutors who won Stone's conviction - Aaron Zelinsky, Adam Jed, Michael Marando and Jonathan Kravis - withdrew from the case. Kravis told the court in a filing he was not only leaving the case but quitting his job as a federal prosecutor.
 A senior Justice Department official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity, called the timing of Trump's tweet an "inconvenient coincidence." The official said he did not know why the four prosecutors withdrew, but said it appeared to be in protest. The official said it was "surprising that that would be the line in the sand."
 U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson is due to sentence Stone on Feb. 20.
 Legal experts described the department's move as highly unusual. Democrats accused Attorney General William Barr, who heads the department, of working to protect Trump's political interests.
 "The president seems to think the entire Justice Department is just his personal lawsuit to prosecute his enemies and help his friends," Chuck Schumer, the top Senate Democrat, told reporters.
 Schumer asked the department's internal watchdog to investigate. Democrat Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, said he also would investigate the reversal.
 "AG Barr must stop being the President's lapdog. They are turning us into a banana republic," Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen added on Twitter.
 Stone, who has labeled himself a "dirty trickster" and "agent provocateur" and famously has the face of former President Richard Nixon tattooed on his back, was one of several Trump associates charged with crimes in Mueller's investigation.
 In a Monday court filing, prosecutors said their proposed sentence fell within U.S. guidelines and would "accurately reflect the seriousness of his crimes and promote respect for the law."
 That came as a surprise to senior Justice Department officials who were expecting prosecutors to ask for a lower range, said a second official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
 Legal experts said it would be unusual for prosecutors to change their proposed sentence after filing a formal recommendation to the court, especially on a high-profile case like this in which senior Justice Department officials as well as courtroom prosecutors are involved in the decision- making.
 Several said that the proposed sentence struck them as unusually severe. Stone's defence team, in a filing late on Monday, disputed the prosecution's calculation and proposed a range of between 15 and 21 months. They asked the judge for a sentence below that range.
 "It is high, but the prosecutors obviously felt there were extenuating circumstances that justified the enhancements," said Lynn Niels, a former federal prosecutor.
 The new Justice Department filing noted that Stone's guideline sentence would be significantly less - about three to four years - if the charge that he threatened a witness, Randy Credico, was not used in the calculation.
 Stone was convicted of the charge. The position taken by the department on the witness tampering charge echoed arguments made by Stone's own defence team in their memo filed late on Monday.
 Mueller's investigation detailed a Russian campaign of hacking and propaganda in the 2016 election and extensive contacts between the president's campaign and Moscow. Stone was one of only two of Trump associates charged in the investigation who went to trial rather than pleading guilty.
 Trump has the power to pardon people for federal crimes, although he has yet to use it in the cases of other former aides convicted in the wake of the Mueller investigations.
 The senior official said he was not concerned about any possible "ripple effect" that could occur in other cases after the four prosecutors quit the case, and said the department's change in its position was "not really that drastic."

 As Valentine's Day approaches, Dee and Jim Chaplin, Waltham residents and owners of Tick Tock Chocolates, 111 Trapelo Road, in Belmont say they've created a unique way for couples to express their love.
 On Feb. 14, noon to 2 p.m., Jessica Lucci, the author of "Love Watch City," will be at Tick Tock reading from her book and handing out a free copy of one of her poems.
 "It's our way to give the community our Valentine gift for them," Lucci said. "Other events I do, I'm mostly on panels or giving lectures and this one is just celebrating love. They're just lovely people, they're a husband and wife team, and what's more romantic than poetry and chocolates on Valentine's Day?"
 Since last May, Dee and Jim's dream has become a reality in Belmont, with the shop completely run by the couple.
 Dee used to be a calibration engineer and technical writer. Jim had a career in social work. In 2005, Dee began making chocolate before graduating from Cambridge School of Culinary Arts' Pastry Program.
 "I think we were just looking at our lives and we figured it's now or never," Jim said as he glanced around the shop. "It's something Dee wanted to do and she was always so supportive of me when I wanted to get my master's. I wanted to be supportive of her because it's something she had always dreamed of."
 Through the work that has gone into the business, Dee and Jim Chaplin have developed a sweeter relationship.
 "I have to tell you, it's really nice to have someone that you can communicate with and trust in the business," Jim said. "We have that inherent trust within ourselves. The things get done that need to get done because we care about the business and that's the best thing about working with someone you love."

OLYMPIA — Fewer businesses will be asked to foot the bill for higher education programs after Gov. Jay Inslee signed Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 6492 on Feb. 10.
 The bill will restructure the business and occupation tax and surcharges put in place by legislation passed last year to fund investments in public colleges as well as to provide grants that increase access for low and medium income students.
 “We are going to make massive investments in public higher ed,” said Sen. Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle. “Both for the institutions and more importantly, for the students who need access to these services.”
 Legislation signed last year and put into effect this year stipulated that on top of the B&O tax rate, certain businesses would also pay a Workplace Education Investment Surcharge.
 Pedersen, the new bill’s prime sponsor, said he and his colleagues realized the demand for higher education programs was much higher than revenues called for in last year’s legislation.
 Senate Ways & Means Committee staff member Jeff Mitchell said the tax rate that took effect in January was estimated to have generated $773 million in revenue over four years, while this year’s adjustment is estimated to bring in over $1 billion during the same timespan.
 Pederson said the new surcharge will affect less than 15,000 businesses and applies only to those defined as “advanced computing” companies, such as Microsoft or Amazon.
 Advanced computing companies are defined as firms that make computer software or hardware, provide Cloud computing services, manage online marketplaces, or online social networking platforms.
 Pedersen said he wanted to focus the majority of the revenue collection on businesses that rely on highly educated professionals.

CALDWELL — The Caldwell Urban Renewal Agency board approved up to $2.4 million Monday for infrastructure for the Canyon County Fair Expo building, but not before some questions were circled about whether urban renewal funding was appropriate for the project.
 Urban renewal agency Commissioner Chris Allgood expressed concern over using urban renewal funds for the fair building infrastructure.
 "I am struggling with urban renewal in this thing (because) typically what we do is support things that increase our tax base and bring business to Caldwell," Allgood said at the agency's Monday meeting. "This is not one of those things. I am having trouble reconciling that. I want to make sure what we do is in our overall plan."
 The Board of Canyon County Commissioners and Canyon County Fair officials asked the agency last month to authorize urban renewal funds to provide the new fair building with infrastructure, including a parking lot, sidewalks, lighting, irrigation and equestrian paths.
 Last year, fair officials unveiled building plans for the approximately 45,000-square-foot building on the corner of the Caldwell Events Center/O'Connor Filed House property, near the South Georgia Avenue curve.
 The expo building will be the first of its kind on the Canyon County Fairgrounds. The building will free up space in the O'Connor Field House and the Caldwell Night Rodeo Stadium, where a lot of fair events take place.

KEOKUK -- Emma Knipe was a solid post player during her high school basketball days at West Hancock.
 Knipe has been able to expand her game in her freshman year at Southeastern Community College, allowing her to flourish and the Blackhawks to succeed.
 Knipe's expanded game has put her at or near the top of the Iowa Community College Athletic Conference in numerous statistical categories and put her in the running for Most Valuable Player for the conference.
 It is the role that Knipe has been seeking all along.
 "I thought it was going to be a huge step. It is, going from high school to college. But I think I've transitioned well. I'm a guard/forward, but I really enjoy it here," said Knipe, a native of Nauvoo, Illinois and a graduate of Warsaw High School. "I was more of a dominant post in high school. Now I'm stepping out and shooting more. I really like it. It's kind of nice to be able to shoot threes and not get told not to like in high school. When Coach tells me to get inside and post up because we need baskets, those are nice, high- percentage baskets. I've stepped up and tried to do everything I can."
 "She was a nice little high school player over at West Hancock. We're real excited to get her in our program. She's a 4.0 kid, a really good student- athlete. Real good in the community. She's a high-character kid. Those are the kind of players you really strive to find," SCC women's basketball coach Jerry Jerome said. "On top of that she's a nice player. She's really expanded her game from high school. She was a little post player who could make that 10 to 12-foot shot. Now she has expanded herself and can make some threes and step out a little bit. But she's had four straight games over 20 points and before that was a 16 and before that was an 18. She's leading the conference in scoring. She's second or third in rebounding. She's done everything we've asked her to do. We've had to lean on her a little bit in side against these bigger post players because she's a little bit quicker than them. She's just a solid kid."
 Knipe leads the ICCAC in scoring, averaging 17.4 points per game. She is tied for fourth in blocked shots (1.0 per game), fifth in rebounds (7.6 per game) and steals (2.1 per game) and 12th in assists (2.1 per game). She is shooting 49.7 percent from the field and has knocked down 13 3-pointers, something she was discouraged from doing in high school.
 Just 15 minutes from home, SCC proved to be the perfect fit for Knipe in more ways than one. She lives on campus, but still goes home to do laundry and see family. And on the court, she has been able to expand her game and help the team to a 14-10 record thus far.
 "I like being close to my family and having them be here at all my games. Cy Hickenbottom was my coach in high school, too, so I felt comfortable being here," Knipe said. "My goal was to get an offer somewhere. But my family sits in a little section over there and I am 15-minutes from home and I have a nephew that I love seeing as much as possible, so that was kind of what made me stay close to home."
 Knipe started playing basketball at an early age, but knows her playing days are winding down. She will spend only one year at SCC before transferring to get a degree in business management. He mother and brother are accountants and she is heading down that path as well. She may continue playing basketball at a four-year school, but nothing is set in stone yet. She is trying to make the most of what is left of this season.
 "It's really interesting to hear the three Alaska girls tell stories about their experiences. I've gotten really close to Aryn Kindig, since we are both local girls. I consider her my best friend on the team. We played each other in high school. She said her coach would get mad at her when she would either foul me or foul out of a game. I was like, 'I'm sorry.' It was kind of funny," Knipe said. "Both my Mom and brother are accountants, so I will probably do something like that. I will only be here a year. With all the dual credits I took in high school, I will only have two years left after this year."

Schroeder was excited that New Path was able to add to its capital reserve in the first year, which ended with a balance of $128,000 for the first year. He said this is not a profit for the developer, but instead is for maintaining the building so it can be a resource to help the chronically homeless as long as possible.
 Though rent increases don't hit New Path tenants directly, they do pull from the limited funds available for housing assistance. Part of the deal the housing authority made when New Path came online was to take 40 existing Section 8 vouchers set aside for residents to use with landlords in the private market and transition them to a type of housing voucher that is connected to New Path itself.
 Watson estimates at any given time the housing authority can only provide assistance for 20% of those who need it, or roughly 2,000 Section 8 voucher holders per year.
 Despite the movement of her limited resources to New Path, Watson praised the program as a positive force in the lives of chronically homeless Boiseans.
 “I think, overall, these are people’s lives that have been able to stabilize and start looking for the future, and not just on the day to day,” she said.

"We start with Jamestown, we talk about first slaves coming in 1619. We talk about the economy in the south being on the backbone of slaves," he said.
 Board member Joanne Pencak suggested that a unit exploring how the slave trade led to American prosperity might be a better lesson to teach.
 She thanked Beaumont and Adams for their honesty and transparency in coming before the board.
 Notte then made a motion for the board to create a diversity and equity council for the district.
 While the motion was met with support, a lengthy discussion followed in which other board members attempted to hash out how such a council would be funded, implemented and run.
 At one point, Notte voiced her impatience over letting the matter potentially get lost in committee. She noted how similar efforts to have a conversation about diversity and equity were scuttled last year in the wake of the raising of a Black Lives Matter flag at RHS campus.
 Notte eventually amended her motion for the board "to direct the superintendent to propose to the board the formation of a diversity and equity council."
 The motion passed unanimously.
 In an interview with the Herald Monday, Beaumont confirmed that two parents spoke with social studies teachers last week about the lesson.
 "They expressed their children's concern about the topic of slavery. Both teachers agreed that the unit could still be taught in a meaningful way by not utilizing those cards ... and being more sensitive to the term of slavery," she said.
 According to Labate, the unit has been taught at the school for at least seven years.
 "We live in a fast-changing world right now. It's our job to respond to that," Beaumont said. "We appreciate the fact that people bring it to our attention because sometimes they don't, and we can't fix it if we don't know it needs to be fixed."
 Moving forward, Beaumont said she wants to empower students to "take action." She said the school will be "talking about how we can have kids have voice in these matters and constructing something for them to be able to do it."
 Late last week, Labate said he and another teacher, who is African American, had a dialogue with students regarding the lesson.
 "It brought those uneasy feelings to light," he said. "It allowed more kids a chance to share if they felt uneasy."
 "It was really powerful to see two different adults from two different walks of life with two different points of view but their goal in the end was to make the best experience for the kids," he said.
 Labate added the situation has "opened up a wonderful discussion with parents and teachers and with kids."

But early in the band's history, when it has only a handful of independently released singles to its name, the group covered many '80s songs, including the Smiths' jangle- pop classic "This Charming Man."
 "We realized that we're not that charming," lead singer and guitarist Braeden Lemasters quips. "The Finn Wolfhard charity event was when we first started being a band. So we learned two '80s covers: 'Blister in the Sun' and 'This Charming Man.' The Smiths are my favorite band -- Johnny Marr is my favorite guitar player -- so 'This Charming Man' kinda stuck."
 Owing to the aforementioned conclusion that the band wasn't as charming as the iconic English indie group, the cover was eventually ditched. "It started to feel a little gimmicky," Minnette says. "So we stopped playing 'This Charming Man.' I'm not going to flaunt flowers around the stage singing Morrissey and pretending to be Morrisey; it just doesn't suit [Wallows]."
 Although on paper the band has been actively releasing music since only 2017, Wallows as a unit has existed for well over a decade. After meeting in a children's music program, the three performed under a plethora of band names, only settling on the moniker "Wallows" with the release of the single "Pleaser." On top of the name changes, Wallows' sound has evolved and morphed over the years as well.
 "I feel like it was more like classic-rock stuff that made it sound darker," Lemasters says of the band's shift in sonic stylings. "I think the fun of being in a band and being able to create music is the idea of not knowing what's coming -- not really thinking things are off-limits or thinking things are not cool or whatever. It's all about inspiration at that specific moment."
 Minnette adds, "If I'm going through a dark time in my life, I feel like the song suits the time. Right now, our music is uplifting and fun; maybe it's just because we're enjoying where we're at. So I feel like it's just going to be how we feel and how people are able to see whatever is happening."

TUMWATER — The Naselle Grays River Valley High School’s (NGRVHS) top knowledge bowl team, known as Monte and the Pythons, competed at the ESD 113 small school regional knowledge bowl meet on Friday, Feb. 7, in Tumwater. The team is made up of Monte Schell, Zanith Wulf, Travis Popkin, John D’Agostino and Cooper Miller.
 At the regional meet, the team competed against 17 other 1B and 2B schools from throughout Pacific, Lewis, Grays Harbor and Thurston counties. The list of competitors included perennial private school powerhouses Pope John Paul II and Northwest Christian of Lacey. Monte and the Pythons was the only 1B school team to face off against both of these two private schools during the regional meet. At the end of the written round and four preliminary oral rounds, the NGRVHS team held third place out of the 18 teams.
 Monte and the Pythons squared off against eventual second place winner Mossyrock and North Beach in the semifinal round. The team came up a couple of points shy of winning the semifinal round before facing Northwest Christian and Adna in a consolation round. At the end of the day, the NGRVHS team placed fifth overall and second among the 1B schools with Pope John Paul II winning first place overall and first among the 1B teams. During the earlier rounds, Monte and the Pythons tied Pope John Paul II with 13 points apiece and beat Northwest Christian 11-10. With their high finish, the NGRVHS team qualified for state competition in Yakima on March 21.
 NGRVHS Knowledge Bowl Coach Justin Laine noted he is extremely proud of his team’s efforts as they earned third place out of approximately 50 teams (many of them from 1A and 2A schools) at each of the regular meets.
 “They competed well at the regional meet,” said Laine. “I look forward to a good showing at the state meet in Yakima. This is a great group of kids with good chemistry.”

FORT MYERS, Fla. -- The crack of the bat at spring training camps replaced the sound of trash can lids banging in homemade YouTube videos as baseball emerged from its winter of cheating scandals and salary dumps to bask in the Florida and Arizona sun.
 The Pittsburgh Pirates and San Diego Padres held their first official workouts, and pitchers and catchers for 16 other teams reported to their Grapefruit and Cactus League complexes on Tuesday. The rest of the major leagues will filter in this week.
 Red Sox players checked in without knowing who their manager will be, almost a month after Alex Cora was fired for his part in the Houston Astros 2017 sign- stealing scheme. Bench coach Ron Roenicke, a former Brewers skipper, will serve as interim manager while the team waits for Major League Baseball to wrap up its investigation into Boston's attempts to steal signs after Cora arrived in '18.
 The Red Sox were also without a former MVP and Cy Young Award winner after the long-haggled trade of Mookie Betts and David Price to the Dodgers was finalized on Monday.
 "Great teammates. Great players," Red Sox outfielder Jackie Bradley Jr. said after arriving at Fenway South on Tuesday. "Time to move forward."
 At the Red Sox complex in Fort Myers, reliever Matt Barnes tossed a football on a back field while teammates stretched and sprinted. The rest of the position players are scheduled to report Sunday; spring training games begin in earnest on Feb. 22.
 Across Fort Myers at the Minnesota Twins' camp, Marwin Gonzalez became the first Astros hitter to apologize for his role in the sign-stealing. The utilityman was in Houston from 2012-18, including the championship season that was the subject of the MLB investigation that led to the firing of manager A.J. Hinch and general manager Jeff Luhnow.
 "I'm remorseful for everything that happened in 2017, for everything that we did as a group and for the players that were affected directly by us doing this," Gonzalez told reporters. "I wish I could take it back and do it a different way, but there's nothing we can do. I just want to move forward and focus on the 2020 team."
 The Dodgers added Betts and Price to make another run at a World Series after being denied in back-to-back seasons by teams that have been accused of cheating. The Astros, who report to West Palm Beach on Wednesday, replaced Hinch with Dusty Baker.
 The Mets were the third team to fire a manager in the wake of the scandal. They reported to Port St. Lucie on Monday with new manager Luis Rojas; he replaced Carlos Beltran, a player on the Astros World Series team who never managed a game for New York.
 "We expect to be a contender," Rojas said in his first spring training news conference. "We have a great roster, great position players with versatility, great starting rotation or pitchers that have a history of Cy Youngs and World Series winners. And our bullpen has a history of saving games and being closers."
 Here is some other news from around spring training:
 Working for tips
 Phillies manager Joe Girardi said he will make sure his pitchers and catchers aren't giving away their signs. And if the team picks up on any tells from opposing pitchers -- within the rules -- that's fair game.
 "We're going to do things the right way and we're going to look for every advantage there is," Girardi said. "If the pitcher is tipping, we're going to use that. And we're going to protect … make sure that our guys aren't tipping. "
 Home again
 Joe Maddon returned to the Angels, where he spent the first three decades of his baseball career. A light-hitting catcher who worked his way up through the organization before managing the Rays and Cubs, he is back with a franchise that hasn't won a playoff game since 2009.
 "It's kind of eerily the same, so I feel pretty comfortable with it," he said, noting that he saw some of the same faces at the complex in Tempe, Ariz., from before he left for Tampa Bay in 2006. "Listen, I've always loved this place. ... I get flooded with nostalgia, I do. And it's OK. It's a good thing."
 Rolling in
 Reliever Aroldis Chapman showed up at Yankees camp in Tampa in a white Rolls Royce convertible with a black roof. But the biggest arrival was right-hander Gerrit Cole, who signed a $324 million, nine-year contract in the offseason.
 "He brings a dynamic that's crazy," first baseman Mike Ford said. "He boosters our staff that's already is awesome. To have him, probably the top pitcher in the game, couldn't be happier."
 New digs
 New Giants manager Gabe Kapler liked the looks of the team's expanded complex at Scottsdale Stadium in Arizona. A three-story building behind the seats down the first base line houses a new clubhouse, weight room, meeting spaces, coaches offices, trainers room and large event space.
 "Everything will be more intertwined, and that's by design," Kapler said. "We want to bring departments together and we want to solve problems collectively. And then we can take advantage of a very diverse group of thinkers."

PLYMOUTH - Cillian Davis and James Kernen have spent the last four years as part of the brotherhood that is the Plymouth South football program. But all good things must come to an end, and Davis (St. Anselm) and Kernen (Assumption) will be on opposite sidelines not once, but twice, during the upcoming college football season.
 "It will be strange seeing Cillian on the opposite sideline instead of standing beside me," Kernen said.
 Kernen and Davis were with their Panther football teammates Wednesday as each signed their College Letter of Intent to play football at the next level.
 "I'm going to enjoy watching them play at the next level," former Plymouth South Head Coach Scott Fry said. "They have a lot in common. They're both members of the National Honor Society, both three-season athletes and both are real leaders on and off of the football field.
 "As a coach, they both check off all of the boxes."
 Davis will focus on wide receiver at St. Anselm after starting on both sides of the football for Plymouth South. He will study Criminal Justice with the hopes of eventually making a career with the FBI.
 Fry credited Davis with changing the direction of his football career with some good old blood, sweat and tears.
 "He ended his junior year as a good football player. He came back his senior year ready to prove he was a great football player," Fry said. "From the time his junior year ended to the start of his senor year, he did every single thing he could to improve as a football player. He put in the work in the weight room and during the pre-season sessions to take his game to the next level."
 Davis said the light bulb went off for him after the Thanksgiving loss to Plymouth North that ended his junior season.
 "I think we got shut out and it wasn't a feeling I wanted to experience ever again. I'm a competitor and I didn't want to be just an average football player any longer," Davis said. "So I decided right there to dedicate myself to becoming a better football player."
 His hard work caught the eye of the St. Anselm football program. Davis made a trip to visit the school and decided pretty quickly it was the best fit for him.
 Even though Kernen was only with the football program for the four years, Fry said it was actually much longer than that.
 "James came to us as a water boy with these big glasses that took up most of his face when he was 8 or 9, and he never left," Fry said. "He never missed a practice or a game as a water boy or a player. It feels like he has always been a part of this program."
 The little water boy is not so little any longer. Kernen is a physical presence on the football field at 6-foot-5, 250 pounds and will try to earn some time in Assumption's offensive line rotation as a tackle after starting on both sides of the football for South.
 "I'd been up to Assumption College a lot to see (Plymouth native) Quentin Hall play, so I was always leaning toward going there," said Kernen, who will study Business. "When I took my official visit I loved the family atmosphere around the school. It felt like home to me."

THE Northern Rivers may be rugby heartland but Aussie rules has staked a claim with some of the most talented young footy players gaining selection in the 2020 intake for the prestigious AFL Gold Coast Suns Academy.
 The Ballina Bombers kicked a massive goal with six of their players being selected.
 Club junior president Tony Bazzana said they are proud of James Buchanan and Bede Francis chosen for the U13 Male, Blake McQueen in the U14 Male and Jack Atkins, Joseph Bull and Tom Grimister in the U15 Male squads.
 “It’s a real testament to the players, coaches and club,” he said.
 “We are super-excited about their selection as these boys have been playing since the U8s, they have developed into great representative players and to see them get to this stage is fantastic.”
 Bede, 12, said he’s stoked he mate James made selection.
 The young midfielder who was selected for the NSW Primary Schools Sports Association AFL State Carnival in 2019 and won Man of the Match last year in the U12 grand final beating the Byron Magpies, was full of beans.
 “It’s a great opportunity to join the academy and get professional training from elite players and coaches,” he said.
 “To be able to take my footy to the next level by being part of the Suns Academy is very exciting.”
 Bazzana said Jack Atkins set a junior club record by playing 159 games wearing the red and black jumper.
 “Jack and Tom have now moved to playing on the Gold Coast but we are proud they got their start at the Ballina bombers,” he said.
 Meanwhile, two Lismore Swans alumni Jai Leach and Sacha Alexeef made the U13 and U14 team respectively.
 And two players from the Byron Magpies, Spencer Alcock and Giles Hannon were also chosen for the U15 Male squad.
 The Magpies congratulated former players Jade Rettenmaier (U15 Girls), Oliver Rojo, Flynn Petersons, and Riley Buckland (U18 Boys) who made Suns Academy Squads.
 According to AFL Queensland, there were also quite a few more Northern Rivers players selected that live in the area but played with other clubs including Tweed and Coolangatta.

SOUTH BEND — The Pacific County Commissioners appeared poised to approve a six-month moratorium on short-term vacation rental licensing at a Feb. 11 hearing, but decided at the last minute to defer a decision for another two weeks.
 The decision came after the commissioners approved a temporary moratorium on short-term vacation rentals at a Dec. 16 meeting. The moratorium does not affect currently permitted short-term vacation rentals.
 Testimony was contentious at times during an hour-long public comment period. It appeared around two-thirds of those in attendance — many from the real estate industry — oppose the moratorium. Nevertheless, a motion was made and seconded by commissioners to OK it, until County Administrator Kathy Spoor suggested kicking it down the road to Feb. 25 at 10 a.m.
 The initial moratorium was recommended by Pacific County Planning Director/Fire Marshall Tim Crose in December, who cited concerns about a lack of monitored and sanctioned compliance as the number of vacation rentals—both licensed and unlicensed—have grown in the county. The Pacific County Planning Commission also recommended the moratorium.
 The temporary moratorium was then approved by the commissioners to give the planning commission and Crose’s office time to review regulations and see if any changes should be made before the Feb. 11 hearing.
 Real estate agents showed up at both the Dec. 16 and Feb. 11 hearing to vehemently oppose the moratorium, saying it would negatively impact their industry and the county’s economy.
 Those in attendance who were in favor of the moratorium were mostly year-round residents living in residential neighborhoods with an R-1 zoning designation, who said they do not want commercial enterprises operating close to their homes.
 The moratorium will be in effect until July 11, 2020.
  _The Observer will have more coverage on short-term vacation rentals in the coming days._

 The drunk driving charges were felonies because Smith has been convicted of similar charges three times in February 2003, September 2004 and February 2008.

If you are a globe trekker, then Unakoti in Tripura must be in your bucket list for sure. This place is ethereal as it boasts of larger than life rock- cut sculptures and gigantic carvings depicting Hindu deities such as Shiva, Durga, Ganesha etc. Going by the sheer magnitude of the area that has sculptures aplenty, it is evident that it must have been a centre of great spiritual significance. And as incredible as it may sound, Unakoti takes pride in having as many as 99,99,999 sculptures! Yes, the name 'Unakoti' itself suggests that this less-explored place in the eastern state of Tripura is home to figurines that amount to one less than a crore.

"Without the reopening of businesses, in the short term, it will affect the supply of medical material and ... in the long run, it will affect the supply of all kinds of production and life materials and will make the control and prevention efforts on the front line unsustainable.

As reported in Part 1 of this story, the Kings are very high on Anderson for what he has brought to the Reign, both on and off the ice. Indeed, there is a lot to like and even get excited about. But the fact remains that he is just 20 years old and not even through his first year at the professional level. As such, he still has some rough edges to his game that most young prospects have to smooth out on their journey to the National Hockey League.

You don’t need to have an existing medical condition before you decide to come along with pills and drugs on your Vietnam travel. Whether you like it or not, you’re sometimes going to experience a stomach bug, diarrhea, or uncomfortable health status from drinking non-bottled water or simply consuming street food. In light of this, you should try to bring along your medication box, as you will never know when you’ll be hit by a stomach bug, and the last thing you want is to be in distress while being far away from a drug store.

But why _this_ dog? "The most beguiling thing about him is he looks into your soul when he looks at you," McFadden says of her charge. She chose him out of a litter at just eight weeks. "He had the It factor," she says. "He'd stop, and I'd talk to him, and he'd cock his head and he'd stand in a perfect pose. I could never take my eyes off him." Judges have been on the same page: "When I put him on the table and the judge approaches, he never takes his eyes off them. He turns to look at them, and he commands their respect." That said, McFadden isn't keen on his tendency to sneeze when they're in the ring, messing up his hair. But "other than that," she concedes, "he's usually pretty good."

The senators on the subcommittee each had a short window for questioning during the hearing, which lasted more than two hours.
 Thinking about the schools in their states and their passionate constituents, several wondered whether NIL rights would give an advantage to schools in states with big markets compared to schools in more rural states. Another asked whether it would lead to less competitive balance, the implication being that the schools with the most resources will be able to outbid schools with less resources.
 Huma provided facts that aimed to show that was already the case, regardless of whether athletes receive compensation.
 Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) joined Blumenthal in pushing Emmert to get the NCAA moving faster.
 “You don’t want us to solve this,” Tester said. “You want us to help you solve this. So the question is, where are we at in talks? … Do you have anything on paper right now?”
 “We don’t, but we will by April,” Emmert said.
 “Are you willing to share that with the folks that are at this table and with us?” Tester said.
 “At that time, certainly,” Emmert said.
 “And you’re willing to take input into how you can make it better?” Tester said.
 “Absolutely,” Emmert said.
 Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), the chairman of the subcommittee, finished the hearing with some thoughts.
 “My personal view is, it lies with those of you at that table at the moment, not us,” Moran said. “But we stand able, we stand ready and willing, to be helpful.”

 When the name "Inter Miami" was announced, some soccer circles groaned and grumbled at the copycat game between American and European teams. But some fans saw the writing on the wall all along:

Ron, just returning to the commentary you made around the long term contracts you signed in Flexibles in North America. I was just trying to put that in the context of all the longer term arrangements that Bemis themselves have put in place prior to you acquiring the business, which I seem to remember involve pretty significant price incentives. So I'm just sort of trying to understand how I should think about what you've done relative to what they have done? Is it completely separate or is it sort of one and the same thing as part of the same process?
