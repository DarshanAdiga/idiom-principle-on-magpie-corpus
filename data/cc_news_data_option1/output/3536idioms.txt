She knew she needed some help -- so she decided to randomly reach out to one of her favorite celebrities on Instagram -- comedian Erin Foster -- to see if she'd respond.
 Much to her surprise, Foster, who has more than half a million followers, replied to the direct message -- and was happy to help. She shared Ciervo's list on her Instagram on August 18.
 "When you have a big following on social media, you have an opportunity and you should do what you want with that," Foster told CNN. "I like to sprinkle in some useful things that can help people. And when you do it authentically, people usually want to participate."
 Foster, who has more than half a million followers, tends to stick with comical and self-deprecating content of her and her famous sister, Sara Foster. But she's also known to engage with her fans online -- and after seeing Ciervo's request, she knew her followers would step up.
 "People really appreciate kindness towards teachers," Foster said. "That's sort of a universally understood thing. Everyone's had a teacher that's had an impact on them, and everyone knows that teachers have a tough time surviving on their pay."
 Ciervo couldn't believe it.
 "When she responded to me that she'd be happy to share my list, I freaked out," she told CNN. "Not only would I hopefully be getting some great things for my students, but I also had to play it cool and not totally fan girl."
 Since her wish list was shared by Foster on Instagram, Ciervo has received more than 100 packages containing books, games and other learning resources.

Amazon.com Inc said it has banned foreign sales of seeds in the United States after thousands of Americans received unsolicited packages of seeds in their mailboxes, mostly postmarked from China.
 The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) in July identified more than a dozen plant species ranging from morning glories to mustard in the bags of unsolicited seeds. It warned Americans not to plant the seeds.
 According to plant experts, seeds from other parts of the world could be non- native varieties that harm commodity crops.

Liverpool’s leading man in attack has looked rusty throughout an unusual pre- season and, in truth, hasn’t been the same since Project Restart.
 Scoring three times once the Premier League resumed back in June, with two of those coming against Brighton, he tried in vain to chase down Jamie Vardy at the top of the division scoring charts as he fell four short of a third- successive golden boot.
 Following last weekend’s Community Shield, his latest drought now stretches to five games though, of course, he has always come back stronger before.
 He wasn’t the only senior star to look out of sorts against Blackpool with Klopp exchanging cross words with Fabinho before the Brazilian was substituted at half-time having endured a difficult pre-season himself.
 With the Reds’ Premier League opener now a week away, the Liverpool boss will hope both players are able to swiftly play themselves back into form when competitive football resumes.

_On Aug. 28, in the afternoon, we (saw) upwards of two dozen swallows circling above the house and yard for a couple of hours almost like a swarm of bees. We have nesters in a bird house every year, but that would only account for a half dozen or so. All I could think of was perhaps a flock getting together to begin their migration south for the winter. It seems like August is early to migrate, but where they’re small birds with a very long way to go, perhaps it’s the answer. Is that plausible?_

Tree swallows are especially well known for some of their large congregations during migration, often called “staging events,” and August is not too early. From mid-August to mid-September, there are often reports of several thousand tree swallows flocking up, especially along the coast from Biddeford Pool down to Ogunquit. The largest group I’ve seen was an estimated 12,300 swallows, mostly in a swarm over Richmond Island, on Sept. 7, 2018, while birding at Kettle Cove in Cape Elizabeth. I echo the comment that it was like a “swarm of bees,” an especially challenging group to try to count. Using my spotting scope I was able to estimate groups, passing at a rate of about 100 every 4 seconds. When I first noticed this group, they appeared to be diving frequently over the tops of the spruces on Richmond Island, apparently feeding on something.

Malcolm Thomas Cofer, whose pride in being a Surry County native was matched only by his love for his chosen home of Smithfield and Isle of Wight County and the family he nurtured here, died Thursday, Sept. 4 at his Magruder Road residence.Mr. Cofer, the son of the late Thomas Linwood and Paulline Johnson Cofer, was born May 29, 1943 and grew up on the family's ancestral farm, located just west of Dendron. He graduated from Surry High School, attended Virginia Tech, and became a Lifelong Hokie Club member.After attending college, Mr. Cofer moved to Smithfield and worked at Smithfield Packing Company before obtaining his license to open an insurance agency affiliated with the Equitable. He operated that agency for the next three decades.Mr. Cofer married a Smithfield native, Edna Powell, in 1966 and the couple had one son, Thomas Edward Cofer, born in 1974. Their son was academically advanced, and from the beginning told his parents he wanted to explore space when he grew up. In 1989 those plans ended when Thomas was killed in a tragic accident at Smithfield High School following an Academic Challenge competition. Thomas' death devastated his parents, but rather than becoming recluses, the couple created and funded a scholarship in his memory, which still operates, and then began rebuilding their lives. Edna enrolled in college to earn a degree, and Mac pursued with renewed vigor a drive to serve the community that had begun in the early 1970s soon after he moved to Smithfield.That service took numerous directions. Mr. Cofer was always fascinated by politics and as early as the 1970s, he ran unsuccessfully twice for a seat on the Smithfield Town Council. He was appointed to Council in 1978 and went on to win that seat in his own right during the next election.Never afraid to take on a controversial project that he thought was in the community's best interest, Mr. Cofer became a vocal proponent of expanding the town's sewage collection system to the area east of Cypress Creek, which had been beset by failing septic systems and limited in its growth potential. The system was installed and had a dramatic and positive impact on the water quality of the Pagan River and Cypress Creek, but it came with a political cost. Voters opposed to the expansion launched a campaign against Cofer and he lost a bid for reelection in 1984.He continued to serve on the town Planning Commission throughout the 1980s and was an early advocate of creating a Historic District Ordinance to protect the town's most historic homes and commercial properties. During the latter of those years, he also served on the Isle of Wight Planning Commission.In 1991, Mr. Cofer won election to the Isle of Wight Board of Supervisors for the Smithfield Election District. During the next eight years, he and his fellow supervisors supported the Isle of Wight School Board in the county's ambitious effort modernize schools. During those years, Isle of Wight built the Smithfield High School Auditorium, Carrollton Elementary School, Windsor High/Middle School and Carrsville Elementary School.In addition to his governmental service, Mr. Cofer was a longtime and enthusiastic member of the Jaycees. He was twice elected president of the Smithfield Jaycees and was a Life Member of the Virginia Jaycees. Former Jaycees recalled his service this week, noting that he was a State Jaycee Senator in 1977 and a founder of a social group known as the Corps of Virginia Gentlemen.He was a charter member of the Smithfield Kiwanis Club and an active volunteer in all its fund raising and public service projects. He took particular pride in the club's annual youth fishing day, during which club members hosted inner city children at one of the Peninsula's fishing piers.Following his years on the Board of Supervisors, he was appointed to the Board of Directors of the Southeast 4-H Educational Center (Airfield 4-H Center) in Wakefield. He became a strong advocate of the center and often spoke to friends about what it offers the community.He was a member of Trinity United Methodist Church.As an adult, Mr. Cofer never farmed, but he never forgot his roots. Throughout his life, he would return to the Cofer farm where he found his soul renewed and his energy restored.In addition to his son, Mr. Cofer was preceded in death by his wife. He is survived by his sister-in-law, Willa S. Powell.Funeral arrangements are pending at this time.Online condolences may be registered at www.littlesfuneralhome.com.

Readers and scholars across the state are mourning the passing of one of the finest writers to emerge from Southeastern North Carolina.
   
 Randall Kenan was found dead Aug. 28 at his home in Hillsborough, according to the Associated Press. He was 57. No cause of death was listed. A graveside service was held Wednesday.
   
 Kenan's latest book, a short story collection titled "If I Had Two Wings," was just published Aug. 4 by W.W. Norton. A story from that collection, "God's Gonna Trouble the Water," appeared recently on the website for O, the Oprah Winfrey Magazine.
   
 "Randall Kenan was a gentle and fierce soul," said novelist Clyde Edgerton, a professor of creative writing at the University of North Carolina Wilmington. "And a unique combination of gentleness and fierceness is found in his stories, novels and essays."
   
 "No one who was ever in Randall's presence will forget his voice and laugh," Edgerton added.
   
 "I have long considered him the heir to the legacy of James Baldwin -- intellectually, artistically, and in terms of his passion for social justice," said Philip Gerard, another UNCW professor and author of "Cape Fear Rising" and other novels. "He was generous and talented, firm in his convictions, and a voice that elevated any conversation he was part of.."
   
 "He was just an immense talent," novelist Daniel Wallace ("Big Fish") told the Raleigh News & Observer. "His best years were still ahead of him."
   
 Born in Brooklyn, N.Y., Kenan was almost immediately shipped South, where he was raised by his grandparents, who ran a dry cleaning business in Wallace, and by a network of great-aunts, aunts and cousins in the Chinquapin community. One of those great-aunts was a kindergarten teacher, who had young Randall reading by the time he was 4.
   
 A bright student, Kenan volunteered with "The Liberty Cart," the outdoor historical drama that ran for several summers in the 1970s in Kenansville. He enrolled at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, originally as a physics major but was lured over into English, studying with the authors Max Steele and Doris Betts.
   
 After graduating from Chapel Hill in 1985, Kenan headed for New York, where he held a variety of positions with Knopf, eventually rising to be a book editor.
   
 His first novel, "A Visitation of Spirits," was published by Grove Press in 1989 to respectful reviews. Real acclaim did not come until 1992, however, with the publication of his short story collection "Let the Dead Bury The Dead," which was a New York Times Notable Book of the year and a finalist for a National Book Critics Circle Award.
   
 Both of Kenan's first two books were set in Tims Creek, a fictional eastern North Carolina community with strong resemblances to his native Duplin County. He would return to Tims Creek for a number of stories in "If I Had Two Wings." "God's Gonna Trouble the Waters," for example, describes the aftermath of a massive hurricane similar to Hurricane Floyd, which flooded much of Chinquapin in 1999.
   
 Kenan's characters were often troubled young men, torn between the South of the Sunday-go-to-meeting and the modern world of "Star Trek," and particularly troubled by their sexuality. He took James Baldwin, the celebrated black gay writer, as a personal hero. In 1993, he published a young adult biography of Baldwin, and he titled his 2007 essay collection "The Fire This Time," a direct reference to Baldwin's classic "The Fire Next Time."
   
 In the meantime, Kenan began to teach, first at Sarah Lawrence College, Columbia University and Vassar, later at the University of Mississippi (where he was the John Grisham Visiting Writer), the University of Memphis and Duke. Eventually, he settled at his alma mater, where he was a professor of English and comparative literature, teaching courses in creative writing.
   
 In 1999, Kenan published his big book -- at 688 pages -- "Walking on Water: Black American Lives at the Turn of the 21st Century." He traveled the country from Alaska to Florida, interviewing African-Americans from activists in Atlanta to film workers in Los Angeles to a Republican congressman, including the descendants of escaped slaves in Canada. Philip Gerard called it "a magisterial work not just of sparkling, powerful prose but also of brave reportage." Edgerton called it "a yet-to-be-fully-realized gift to all Americans."
   
 In "The Fires This Time," Kenan tried to measure how America had changed, or had not changed, since Baldwin wrote his 1963 book. The collection also contained memorable portraits of Kenan's grandfather, and of his own father, a long-term prison inmate who found religion behind bars.
   
 In later years, the honors piled up. Kenan was a Guggenheim Fellow, a Whiting Award winner, a winner of the John Dos Passos Prize and of the Sherwood Anderson Award. In 2005 he received the North Carolina Award for Literature, the state's highest award for letters. He was admitted to the Fellowship of Southern Writers in 2017 and in 2018 was named to the N.C. Literary Hall of Fame.
   
 Kenan had said that he was working on a major project dealing with the Atlanta child murders of 1979-1981. Obituaries listed one unfinished work titled " There's a Man Going 'Round Taking Names."

Germany, the current head of the European Union, will discuss possible sanctions against Russia over the poisoning of Alexei Navalny if the Kremlin does not provide an explanation soon, its foreign minister said Sunday.Russian opposition leader and anti-corruption campaigner Navalny fell ill on a flight last month and was treated in a Siberian hospital before being evacuated to Berlin.Germany said last week there was "unequivocal evidence" that President Vladimir Putin's top foe had been poisoned using Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok."We have high expectations of the Russian government to solve this serious crime," Heiko Maas told German daily Bild. "If the government has nothing to do with the attack, then it is in its own interest to back this up with facts."If Russia does not help clarify what happened "in the coming days", Germany will be compelled to "discuss a response with our allies," Maas said.The crime against Navalny was a violation of the international Chemical Weapons Convention and there must be an appropriate response, he said. "When we think about sanctions, they should be as targeted as possible."Western leaders and many Russians have expressed horror at what Navalny's allies say is the first known use of chemical weapons against a high-profile opposition leader on Russian soil.The Kremlin has denied responsibility for the attack and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said that Germany is yet to share any findings with Moscow's prosecutors.Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Sunday accused Germany of stalling efforts to probe the Navalny case."Berlin is stalling the process of investigation for which it's calling. On purpose?" she said on Facebook.'Several indications'Maas said there were "several indications" that Russia was behind the poisoning, in the strongest accusations yet from Germany."The deadly substance with which Navalny was poisoned has in the past been found in the hands of Russian authorities."Only a small number of people have access to Novichok and this poison was used by Russian secret services in the attack against former agent Sergei Skripal," he said, referring to a 2018 attack on the former double agent and his daughter in the English city of Salisbury.The Skripals spent days in a coma before recovering but local resident Dawn Sturgess died after picking up a discarded perfume bottle allegedly used to carry the poison.The Navalny case is only the latest in what Berlin has seen as a series of provocations by Putin that have damaged ties and called future cooperation into question.The poisoning comes a year after the murder in broad daylight of a former Chechen rebel commander in a Berlin park, which German prosecutors believe was ordered by Russia.Nord Stream 2 German Chancellor Angela Merkel also revealed in May that Russia had targeted her in hacking attacks, saying she had concrete proof of the "outrageous" spying attempts.On the subject of which sanctions could be discussed by the EU, Maas did not rule out action relating to Nord Stream 2, a multi-billion- euro Russian-German gas pipeline nearing completion that has drawn the ire of US and European partners alike."I hope... that the Russians do not force us to change our position on Nord Stream," Maas said, adding that the consequences of any potential cancellation of the project would also need to be weighed, and that the debate on sanctions should not be "reduced" to one point.The controversial pipeline is meant to deliver Russian gas to Europe, but the German government has faced growing calls to abandon it as tensions with Russia escalate.Bild slammed Merkel last week for comments that Nord Stream 2 should be judged independently from Moscow's actions."Vladimir Putin views the gas pipeline as an important strategic weapon against Europe and as a vital source of funding for his war against his own people," it said.

His passion for life was contagious, and his laugh will be remembered and missed by all who knew him. He was the first to lend a hand and would be the first to help anyone who was in need. Tommy was loved and his memory will be cherished by anyone that was fortunate enough to know him. Tommy was a graduate of Our Lady of Peace grade school and Mercyhurst Preparatory School (1986). After a proud service to our country in the U.S. Navy, (1986-1989), Tommy attended SUNY Buffalo where he completed his B.S. and Masters in Urban Planning. From his close friends "My favorite thing to do was to make him laugh, and if you knew him, you know that laugh. It was loud and hard, the kind that would turn heads. I will miss that. His love and loyalty to his family was tremendous, and his face would light up when talking about childhood memories…His heart was huge and without hesitation shared whatever was needed to anyone." "He did have a wonderful laugh! Now the angels get to hear it" "I will always have you in my heart and in between my ears. XOXO. Rest easy Cooney!" Sign the Guestbook at www.GoErie.com/obits.

Sanjay Raut, the Rajya Sabha (RS) member of the Shiv Sena, has criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government over Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman's "act of God" comment. Raut, in his weekly column Rokh Thok in the Sena mouthpiece Saamana, took on the BJP and said blaming god for the failure of the government is an "insult to Hindutva".In end-August, during the 41st Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council meeting, Sitharaman had referred to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic as "an act of God" that disrupted economic activities. Raut, in the column, wrote, "The country's collapsed economy is due to an Act of God, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said so. What kind of Hindutva is this to cover the failure of the government by blaming God? If God is being accused, in which court will he be tried? ... Blaming God for the failure of the government is an insult to Hindutva." He also took on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. "Our PM Modi speaks on all issues under the sun, but does not speak on the battered economy, or even touches upon the question that has cropped up because of the economic woes. On the road from demonetisation to lockdown, our economy has died," he wrote. He gave examples of several countries, including Brazil, which are helping their nationals with financial aid to tide over the pandemic and its resultant economic impact. "During the pandemic, several countries such as Brazil are helping their people. For them it is not an Act of God, but an economic crisis that has befallen on their people and governments are helping them with financial aid," he said.

Marsha Armistead Fleming Eatherton1941-2020With a sad and aching heart, I tell you that I lost the love of my life on August 20, 2020. Marsha and I were married 41 years and one month on that day. Each day she brought sunshine into my gloomy dark world. I don't have the words to tell how I will miss her.Marsha was born on October 14, 1941 in Brownsville, Texas where her father, Harry Bradford "Mutt" Fleming, was based as a Captain for Pan American Airways. Her mother, Mary Elizabeth "Peg" née Hodge, occupied her time farming cotton, with money she borrowed from her father, while Mutt was flying. Peg loved mentioning that one year she made more from her cotton farming than Mutt did as a pilot. Later, Mutt was Chief of Operations for Pan Am at LaGuardia, and Harry Bradford "Brad" Fleming, III was born on June 12, 1943 at Douglaston, Long Island. But Mutt wanted to return to flying so at his request he was reassigned to Brownsville where Mary Lois McIlwain née Fleming was born on April 6, 1945.Marsha had illustrious ancestors on both sides of the aisle. One of her Armistead ancestors, Gen. George Armistead, was commander of Fort McHenry during the War of 1812 and commissioned a flag, "The Star-Spangled Banner", large enough to be seen by the British ships at sea. Francis Scott Key was inspired by his view of an abortive British attack on Fort McHenry and, seeing the flag still flying in the morning, he wrote the words to our Anthem. The flag is now at the Smithsonian in Washington D.C. Another, Gen. Lewis Armistead, a Confederate from Louisiana, died at the battle of Gettysburg after getting further in Pickett's Charge than any other save one.Houston was Marsha's home since the second grade. She liked to give her schooling as "Poe, Lanier, Lamar and U of H" saying she didn't need to look far for what she wanted. She also studied art at the Glassell School of Art, producing remarkable paintings and drawing of the natives we met in our travels.For a hometown girl, Marsha loved to travel. We were in Kenya and Tanzania about 15 times. We travelled to Tahiti and Bora Bora. We went from top to bottom of Madagascar amid lizards, lemurs and lice. We fly-fished in Argentina, Chile, New Zealand, and Scotland. In Papua New Guinea, Marsha caught a 35-pound barramundi from waters which are home to huge salt-water crocodiles. In Cambodia, we visited Angkor Wat and Tonle Lake. We went to Sri Lanka, and to Yangon on the Irrawaddy River where the flying fishes play and the sun comes up like thunder out of China cross the bay. We also went to Alaska through the Inside Passage; to Thailand, Nepal, and India; to New Zealand and Australia. We took train and cruiser trips when overland travel became hard for old bones. We trained about the coast of England, Wales and Scotland from London and back to London again. We travelled by train from London through the Chunnel to France, Germany, Austria, Luxemburg and back to London again. We cruised the Baltic to visit Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Estonia, Norway and back to London again. We cruised the Caribbean, the Nile from Cairo to Abu Simbel, the Andaman Islands, South East Asia, the Bay of Bengal, the Turquoise Coast of Turkey, the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Some of our happiest hours were in London at the East India Club and the Carlton Club. The staff at both clubs loved Marsha.But beyond travel, beyond fishing, Marsha loved and adored her pets – Good Dog, Andy, Poochie, and me. She loved her 10 bull frogs, 10 or so cichlids, 9 feral cats which she fed twice each day and more birds and squirrels that you can count. She loved people – her neighbors, her card playing group, her fellow members of the Boulevard Oaks Ladies Club, and all the ladies in the Ladies Auxiliary of The Colonneh Club. She was enormously proud to be a past-President of that group. She was the happiest person I've ever known.In early June, Marsha was told that she had inoperable lung cancer. She took the news with grace, telling her M.D., "Well, we all have to die sometime." She told me that she only regretted that she couldn't be here to help me when my time comes. Marsha was her happy self to the end, going with her oxygen tank to her sister Loli's house to play Mexican Train, and complaining to me if she lost.Due to Covid there won't be a service. When my own time comes, our ashes will be spread over a spot which we both loved. When Edgar Allen Poe lost his wife, his epitaph to her mirrors my feelings for Marsha."And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride, In her sepulchre there by the sea— In her tomb by the sounding sea."To leave a condolence for the family, please visit josephjearthman.com.

In his 20s, Imber was instinctively drawn to painting from nature. Pursuing his masters at Boston University in the 1970s, he studied under Philip Guston, who became a friend and mentor. The first gallery clearly documents Guston’s influence through paintings and drawings of chunky, darkly cartoonish figures, many suffused in longing. There is Imber in bed with his feminine idol Sophia Loren, for example; she a vision of loveliness immersed in a book, and he a sleeping, bizarrely oversized head atop a blocky naked body. There is humor and sweetness here, but Loren also ignores him, and she is rendered with softness and affection, while Imber portrays himself as almost grotesque. In a drawing nearby, “The Approach,” he moves toward her sleeping body in a manner that feels lecherous and predatory.

So Trump blamed the protests and the riots on Biden even though, wait for it, Biden isn't the president and has been living in his basement most of the year.
