And for your information, even for the purpose of planning what we will have at the end of the day if this bill is passed into law, is we’ll have an agency that will be responsible. And as you rightly know, Mr President has sanctioned ever since he came on board, that there should be a budget line, a budget item for recovered assets.

He added that playing now also gives Big Ten teams a chance at a bowl game and the college football playoff.
 “If we could do it sooner rather than later and the medical processes that we put in place would allow us to do that, than that would be in the best interest of the student-athletes to have something more akin to a normal season and give them the most opportunity possible,” said Beekman.
 Gov. Whitmer is on board with the decision and said in a press conference today that the University of Michigan and Michigan State University have excellent medical experts and testing needed to try to play now.
 “I support the decision that they made,” said Gov. Whitmer. “It’s not my decision to be made. It’s theirs and they will move forward.”
 Beekman says MSU will initially allow only families of players and coaches into Spartan Stadium on game day.
 He believes that policy won’t change later in the season, but adds that with the coronavirus, nothing is 100% certain.

ELKO – An Elko man accused of sexually assaulting a minor a year ago was arrested Tuesday at a northside residence, four days after a criminal complaint was filed against him.
 According to an Elko County Sheriff detective’s unsworn declaration in support of the complaint, a 15-year-old girl messaged then 22-year-old Christian Ochoa on Sept. 18, 2019, asking if he would buy her alcoholic beverages. He replied that he would, and suggested that she sneak out of her house. She was picked up by Ochoa in a BMW and driven to a convenience store where he purchased drinks.
 Ochoa then drove to a turnout on the edge of town where they both drank and the girl passed out. When she woke up she was wearing only sweatpants and sandals, and her underwear was missing, the detective stated.

When Benson announced the mass mailing, she was criticized by President Donald Trump, who wrongly stated that she was sending absentee ballots, not applications.
 A record 2.5 million votes were cast in the August primary, including a record 1.6 million absentee ballots that were submitted by mail, at a drop box or in a clerk’s office. Already, about 2.3 million absentee ballots have been requested for the fall election, which Benson said puts Michigan on track to receive more than 3 million that are completed.
 At a virus-related news conference that included Benson and voting advocates on Wednesday, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer thanked the state Senate for passing legislation that would let certain clerks start processing a surge of absentee ballots the day before the election. She urged the House to follow suit.
 Benson laid out options to vote, including requesting and returning an absentee ballot by mail, voting in person before Election Day or going to the polls on Nov. 3. She again pressed the Republican-led Legislature to change the law so ballots received after Election Day are counted. The bill appears unlikely to go anywhere despite concerns about postal delays.
 “We’re entering the final stretch of what may be one of the most contentious, highly polarized election cycles that any of us have ever seen. We can and we will succeed to make sure our voices, the voices of all of our citizens, are heard and that every vote is counted,” Benson said.

An ice-cold worry blowing across the state.
 “We’re seeing somewhere between 4 and 5 thousand restaurants and hotel locations saying they don’t think they can make it through the next 6 months if policies stay the way they are,” said Justin Winslow, Michigan Restaurant and Lodging Association.
 He doesn’t want the hospitality industry left in the cold and is looking to bring policy changes like expanding indoor capacity.
 “Can we get that to 75 percent? Or somewhere closer to a break even or dare I say profitable?” Winslow said.
 Winterizing outdoor spaces is also an option.
 Winslow says one of the struggles is it’s not clear what data and testing rates the state is waiting to see before making a move.
 “What are those benchmarks? Is it a 3 percent positive test rate or lower?” he said. “We know 6 of the 8 regions average zero deaths per day from this disease. There’s still a risk, the disease isn’t gone, but the risk profile is a little different than it looked in the spring.”

While Halleen was a runner who liked to bulldoze defenders and move the pile with pure power, Bridger depends more on his quickness and elusiveness in traffic. Bridger also has the upper body strength and leg drive to absorb contact and make yards after the initial hit, but it’s his ability to hide behind blockers, then cut on a dime and explode through a crease that sets him apart.
 “Nigel has the speed to score from long distance, so he can get big plays for you,” said Southeast coach Ryan Gottula, whose 3-0 Knights host No. 7 Creighton Prep (1-1) at 8:15 p.m. Friday at Seacrest Field.
 “But as we saw the other night, he’s a tough runner too,” Gottula added about Bridger, who rushed for 895 yards and five touchdowns in his sophomore and junior years combined at Crete. “He brings a lot to the table.”

There was an adjustment period for running back Nigel Bridger as he made the transition from Crete to Lincoln Southeast for his senior season of football.
 It appears after three games, Bridger is now ready for the next phase — being the main guy in a Knights running game that likes to wear down opposing defenses with their huge offensive line and play keep-away with the ball by grinding out long, physical, time-consuming drives.
 Bridger rushed for just 42 yards in the first two games combined, but the 5-foot-8, 190-pound back went off for 174 yards on 21 carries and two touchdowns in the Class A No. 5 Knights’ 35-10 win over No. 8 Grand Island last Thursday at Seacrest Field.
