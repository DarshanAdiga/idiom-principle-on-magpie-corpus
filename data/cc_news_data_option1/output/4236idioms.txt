Mary Louise Smolsky Patalonis, 96, of Kingston, passed away Sunday, Oct. 18, 2020, at The Jewish Home of Eastern Pennsylvania, Scranton, where she was a resident for the past 30 months.


  Mary was born March 4, 1924, in Exeter. She was the daughter of the late Agnes Maslowski and William Smolsky. Mary attended Plymouth schools and was a parishioner at St. Casmir Church, Larksville, and later, The Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, Kingston.


  As a young woman, Mary was known for her affability, beauty, style and lovely singing voice. She was employed by Pomeroy’s Department Store on The Square in downtown Wilkes-Barre as a salesgirl in women’s clothing and accessories. She easily became the top sales person of her department, as Mary was friendly and easily conversed with her customers as she would effortlessly style and accessorize an entire outfit to sell.


  Mary married and raised her family in Long Island, N.Y. In her 50s, Mary returned to the Wyoming Valley, eventually residing in Daniel J. Flood Tower, Kingston, where she lived a very active and happy life.


  Mary was known for being a meticulously clean and orderly person. She kept her apartment spotless, which was often used as a “showroom” for potential renters at her apartment complex. She blessed many family members and friends with her gifts of cleaning which were highly sought after.


  Mary had many enjoyments including her daily walks of five to 10 miles through Kingston and Wilkes-Barre with her equally energetic friend, Violet, meeting her friends John, Betty, David, Betty, and others for coffee at The Bakehouse and Burger King, praying the Rosary, frequently attending Mass at St. Ignatius and having great devotion to St. Padre Pio, shopping for only “good quality apparel” and traveling to visit her children and grandchildren and her dearest friends, Gracie and Anthony Suarez. Mary will also be remembered for her love of music, especially Johnny Cash and the movie “Walk The Line.”


  Mary was preceded in death by her husband, Leonard Patalonis; sister, Florence Butler Bedosky; and brother, William Smolsky; brothers-in-law, Leonard Butler; and Richard Williams; and niece, Mary Agnes Tomchak.


  Surviving are her children, Deborah Patalonis, Long Island, N.Y.; Lenny Patalonis, Long Island, N.Y.; Anne Sintic and husband, William Cohill, Philadelphia; Marie Dugre, Philadelphia; Linda Graham and husband, James Graham, New Jersey; grandchildren, Kerri and Walter Dobbeck; Lindsay and Rob Aitken; Melissa Sintic; Sara Sintic; and Sid Sarin; Derrick and April Fiume- Altimari; Jason Dugre; James Graham; and Abby Graham-Drisdom and husband, Kahid Drisdom; and great-grandchildren; sisters, Eleanor Williams, New York; and Lucille Tomchak and husband, Robert Tomchak, Hanover Twp.; numerous nieces and nephews; great-nieces and nephews; and great-great-nieces and nephews.


  The family expresses their most heartfelt appreciation to Mary’s health care providers, Dr. Jyoti R. Shah, Dr. Keyur Mavani, Dr. Bojana Milekic, Dr. Stephen Jaditz, Marianne OBoyle, RN, and all the health care staff, employees, and volunteers at the The Jewish Home of Eastern Pennsylvania for their wonderful and skilled care, love and friendship they so generously provided to Mary, especially during this pandemic.


  Family and friends are invited to meet for Mass of Christian Burial at 10:15 a.m. Friday in St. Ignatius Church, Kingston.


  Interment will be in St. Mary’s Cemetery, Hanover Twp., immediately after Mass.


  Family and friends are invited to call from 5 to 7 p.m. Thursday at S.J. Grontkowski Funeral Home, 530 W. Main St., Plymouth.

Bloomberg) -- A week after Microsoft Corp. led a global attack against one of the world’s most prolific malware groups, the company says it’s winning an ongoing battle to temporarily destabilize the malicious botnet ahead of the U.S. presidential election.


  When Microsoft and its coalition of partners attacked the infrastructure supporting the popular Trickbot malware, they identified 69 servers and routers hosting the botnet around the world. As of Oct. 18, they’d compromised 62 of them, according to a Microsoft statement. A botnet is a network of computers infected with malware.


  In response, Microsoft observed Trickbot’s operators attempt to add 59 new servers to try to salvage their botnet. But those, too, were successfully infiltrated by Microsoft’s team within hours of adoption, according to the company.


  In all, Microsoft officials said they’ve “taken down” 120 of those 128 systems.


  “As we expected, the criminals operating Trickbot scrambled to replace the infrastructure we initially disabled,” according to Microsoft’s statement. “We fully expect that Trickbot’s operators will continue looking for ways to stay operational. What we’re seeing suggests Trickbot’s main focus has become setting up new infrastructure, rather than initiating fresh attacks.”


  Microsoft and its partners started their attack on Oct. 9 after winning a court order to disrupt Trickbot, known for infecting and stealing troves of data before exposing victims to ransomware attacks. Cyber-attackers use ransomware to lock users out of their own computers, while demanding payment in exchange for a key to regain access. The threat of ransomware in the days leading up to the Nov. 3 presidential election remains a credible cybersecurity threat against voting systems, according to the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, part of the Department of Homeland Security.


  In less than a week, Microsoft’s operation has produced results.


  When the attack started, Trickbot’s system included “many thousands” of active victims, which have since been reduced to “just more than 200,” said Alex Holden, founder of the information security investigations firm Hold Security LLC. However, Trickbot’s operators are still armed with the login credentials stolen from its many millions of victims breached in the last five years. Those could still be used to execute a damaging elections-related ransomware attack, if those credentials include access to state and local governments, he said.


  “The botnet is down but not out,” said Holden, whose specializes in investigating complex malware systems. “It’s not mission accomplished.”


  Along with activating existing credentials, Trickbot may also attempt to salvage its malicious network by renting space from other botnet operators. This will likely take weeks or months, Holden said.


  Microsoft’s Tom Burt, corporate vice president for customer security & trust, said it would be a victory just to stifle Trickbot until the U.S. elects its next president. Getting rid of the botnet altogether is a monumental task that will require support from a global coalition, he said. That includes the continued support of internet service providers and server hosts around the world, including in the U.S., Germany, South Korea, Indonesia, Kyrgyzstan, Brazil and Cambodia, he said.


  In the days after Microsoft announced its attack, skeptics such as cyber researchers at Proofpoint Inc. and Intel 471 questioned Microsoft’s ability to successfully execute a sustained attack. “Typically, these types of actions don’t result in a direct reduction of threat activity,” said Sherrod DeGrippo, senior director of threat research and detection at Proofpoint.


  Intel 471 found that Trickbot had returned as early as Oct. 15. However, Microsoft’s early efforts have mitigated some of that skepticism.


  “If you can’t arrest them, disruption is the next best thing,” said Mark Arena, chief executive officer of Intel 471. “But these guys can and have added new servers all the time. A definitive takedown is asking a lot, but if Trickbot operators are busy on the run trying to fix their infrastructure, then maybe they can keep them on the run until the election.”

He said he finally made it to his house where he grabbed a Ruger AR-15 and shot two of the dogs, causing the pack to scatter.

There’s one more new, though slight, addition. Microsoft recently released a new control to allow you to change the refresh rate of your display as part of the Settings menu. This feature originally surfaced in Microsoft’s Dev Channel for Windows Insiders, a proving ground for the company to try features that may or may not appear in upcoming Windows 10 releases.


  While we tested an extremely late build of the October 2020 Update, Microsoft has added this new feature as part of the official release. Another apparent “feature” of the new release—new Office Web apps that have appeared in the Start menu—apparently is just a bug.


  As before, you may not see the Windows 10 October 2020 Update release right away.


  “We are throttling availability over the coming weeks to ensure a reliable download experience, so the update may not be offered to you right away,” John Cable, vice president of program management for Windows Servicing and Delivery, said in a blog post. “Additionally, some devices might have a compatibility issue for which a safeguard hold is in place, so we will not offer the update until we are confident that you will have a good update experience.”


  What’s next for Windows is somewhat up in the air. Microsoft said in May that it was repurposing a revamped version of Windows, Windows 10X, for single- screen devices, after it was expected to power dual-screen PCs like the Surface Neo.


  But the Surface Neo has been delayed, and Windows 10X looks more like a replacement for Windows 10 Home in S Mode. Will Microsoft release the next feature update for Windows in spring 2021, or will it hold it for fall? At this point, no one knows for sure.

 # Short-handed Tallmadge volleyball stumbles into postseason
 Roger Gordon
 Correspondent
 The Tallmadge volleyball team did not exactly end the regular season on a high note.
 The Blue Devils lost their final four matches, the last of which was a 25-13, 25-23, 25-14 defeat Oct. 15 at Suburban League American Conference rival Aurora.
 Tallmadge finished the regular part of its schedule with a 13-7 overall record and a 7-5 mark in the American Conference.
 “Aurora took care of business,” Blue Devils head coach Jim Maloof said. “I changed the rotation a little bit and tried to change some things up a little before the second set, but it just wasn’t meant to be. The team generally wasn’t clicking that well. When you’re off a little bit as a team, and a new setter is trying to work things out, it’s tough.”
 That new setter is senior Kaela Skubic, who had 15 assists. Skubic has changed positions from her usual defensive specialist slot ever since junior Ellie Kirker, the regular setter, went down with an injury a couple weeks ago.
 “It wasn’t clicking for Kaela against Aurora,” said Maloof. “She clicked a lot better against Revere two weeks ago. “With Ellie not being there, it was hard to get the offense going. If we’d been able to click offensively, the outcome would’ve been a bit different.
 “I believe that Ellie is going to be back for the postseason in some capacity. We’re still trying to assess where we’re at. It’s taking a little bit longer for her to recover from her injury than we thought. It’s just one of those things. Mentally, she just has to get out there and move around a little bit and say, ‘You know what? I’m going to be OK.’ I think she just needs to get her confidence back. Once she does that, I think she’ll be just fine.”
 Maloof obviously would have liked to finish the regular season on a better note.
 “But if you put things in perspective, we’ve had a tough schedule,” he said. “I made it that way, so I’m not complaining. I did that to prepare the team as best we could. In the last four matches, there was a tough four-set loss to Highland, which is probably one of the better Division I teams. Then we dropped one to Brecksville-Broadview Heights in five sets, and then we dropped one to Revere in five.
 “I think the loss to Aurora was a little bit of a carryover from all of those matches. At the end of the day, I knew Aurora was going to be a tough match because of the way they match up against us. They match up with us better than any team we played all season.
 “I knew going into that match that we were going to have a hard time. Sometimes you know certain matchups are just going to cause you trouble, and you try to do the best you can to get around them.”
 Senior outside hitter Emma Eyre had 18 digs and five kills.
 “It wasn’t one of Emma’s better matches, but she still did a good job,” said Maloof. “She’s a hustler and a worker. She worked hard the entire match and definitely put out a 100 percent effort.”
 Junior middle hitter Mia Hurst had five kills, Emma Garbinsky had four service points and sophomore middle hitter Kendall Kirkland contributed three blocks.
 “Kendall’s blocking has definitely come along,” the coach said. “Anytime you have somebody step up and lead the team in a category, it’s nice, especially for a younger player like her.”
 Tallmadge, seeded fourth in its bracket, received a first-round bye and is set to host the winner of 10th-seeded Garfield Heights Trinity and 36th-seeded Akron Springfield in a Northeast 4 Division II sectional final Oct. 22 at 6 p.m.
 If they win, next up for the Blue Devils would be the winner of sixth-seeded Rocky River and 23rd-seeded Canal Fulton Northwest in a district semifinal Oct. 28 at 6 p.m.
