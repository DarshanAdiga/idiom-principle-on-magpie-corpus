It was quite a week for Herman, who had three birdies over his final four holes Friday simply to make the cut. He followed that up with a career-low 61 on Saturday to get into striking distance before taking the victory.

 # It's time to bring out the pads: Bengals turning up the physicality on Tuesday
 Tyler Dragon
 Cincinnati Enquirer
 Walk-throughs were the norm during the first two weeks of training camp. Last week, the Cincinnati Bengals were permitted to put on helmets. The team was in helmets and shells on Monday. Yet, the vibe never quite felt like actual training camp. A sense of normalcy is going to be restored during Tuesday’s practice.
 The Bengals are wearing pads for the first time at training camp. Bengals coach Zac Taylor spoke in anticipation of Tuesday during last week’s press conference.
 “Put the pads on and then training camp really starts. So, it's a good progression for us. We're going to utilize it the right way. We're going to make sure that players are fresh on (Tuesday), to give us all they've got when we do strap on the pads and start competing,” Taylor said last week.
 Rookies reported to training camp on July 21 and veterans showed up on July 28, but Bengals coaches have felt all along that training camp’s official commencement fell on Aug. 18.
 “It’s close to feeling like football,” Taylor said. “We are getting in that right direction, but it’ll be exciting on (Tuesday) when we can start to put on the pads and actually get into what our normal training camp has felt like in the past.”
 The NFL has authorized 14 padded practices during the third and final portion of training camp, labeled the “contact integration period.” Taylor and the Bengals won’t use all allotted full-padded practices, but the team plans to get close to the maximum allowed. There is a tentative plan for three to four scrimmages during the contact integration period.
 While in full pads, the Bengals defense is going to prioritize tackling. Lou Anarumo’s defense was one of the worst tackling teams in the AFC last season.
 “I told the players this, first off tackling is primarily about timing and angles. The physical part of it you'll get work on, but if you don't have the proper angle and the proper timing then you don't even have a chance to physically get the guy on the ground,” the defensive coordinator said. “Once we get pads on we'll emphasize the physical part of it. Like every year we'll work on it every day with even more emphasis this year."
 On offense, the primary objective is to get Joe Burrow and the offense to jell in a game-like atmosphere. The Bengals have thrown the playbook at Burrow, and thus far, the workload hasn’t been too daunting for the rookie quarterback.
 “We always go at the speed of the quarterback. Everything that we do is geared toward how much you can handle, and the volume that he can handle and the speed in which we can put it on him. So far, I would say, he has not proven that he’s needed any more time to study and learn than anybody else that I’ve been around. We kind of throw it all at him,” Bengals offensive coordinator Brian Callahan said. “We haven’t pulled back one bit and he’s handled everything we’ve thrown at him. It’s been really encouraging and exciting in that regard.”
 The contact integration period is the most influential part of training camp, especially for the new-look Bengals. The Enquirer projects the Bengals to have five new starters on defense and two first-year starters on offense. Training camp may have started last month, but the type of training camp players and coaches have grown accustomed to begins on Tuesday.

“If you can find a job right out of high school, you may be tempted to forego college, even though you know it can lead to a better job further down the road,” says Dr. Doug Shapiro, Executive Director of The National Student Clearinghouse. “There are also many high school graduates and their families who are growing more concerned about the cost of college and fearful of taking on too much debt to pay for it.”

“I remember the first time I visited the county jail. So many young men, and they were mostly Black or brown or poor,” she wrote in her 2019 book, “The Truths We Hold,” recalling her time as a young prosecutor. “They represented a living monument to lost potential, and I wanted to tear it down.”
 But she also focused on issues that activists said punished poor and minority families. She took on truancy and supported a statewide law modeled on her city initiative that threatened parents with jail time, fines and lost public benefits if parents failed to send their children to school.
 “We took the relationship between a school, a parent and a child — instead of making a metric out of it, to improve the opportunities to get to school, to understand the barriers to get to school — we made them criminals,” said Jessica Bartholow, a policy advocate at the Western Center on Law & Poverty.
 Harris only barely won her race for state attorney general in 2010, claiming the title of California’s “top cop” during a period of rapidly shifting views on criminal justice. Soon the Black Lives Matter movement was taking hold, along with outrage over police brutality, prompted by the killings of Black people such as Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown.
 Harris declined to support state legislation that would have required her office to conduct independent investigations of officer-involved shootings. While she made state law enforcement officers wear body cameras, she did not support forcing local departments to do so. As a former prosecutor, she believed the decisions were best made locally, she said.
 Now Harris supports outside investigations of police shootings, one of several shifts on policing policies she’s made in the U.S. Senate.

 It was also as attorney general that she became friends with then-Vice President Joe Biden's son, Beau, who was Delaware's attorney general.
 Harris and the younger Biden worked together on a settlement with the nation’s five largest mortgage lenders following the foreclosure crisis. The deal would reduce loans for roughly 1 million households, but Harris and Biden were among the last attorneys general to sign on, arguing it let the lenders off too easily.
 They talked nearly every day, Harris said, with Beau Biden supporting her decision to keep fighting despite political pressure to take the deal. Joe Biden said this past week that relationship was key in his decision to tap Harris as his running mate, and he was visibly emotional Wednesday when she talked about his son, who died of a brain tumor in 2015.
 Harris won her Senate seat in 2016 as Trump won the presidency, setting off an immediate scramble among Democrats about who would run to replace him. Within a week of her swearing-in ceremony, Harris turned to her prosecutorial skills to grill retired Gen. John Kelly, then Trump's nominee for homeland security secretary, about the new administration's handling of some young immigrants personal information.
 “We would not use this information against them?” she asked. Kelly fumbled his answer.
 The moment was an early demonstration of the kind of senator Harris would be — one unafraid to battle Trump and good at creating viral moments that energized Democrats.
 Nearly all of the Democratic senators joined Republicans in voting for Kelly. But Harris was among 11 Democrats, and just three first-term senators, who did not. Nathan Barankin, then Harris's chief of staff and a longtime aide, recalled Harris making an aggressive case to her colleagues that they should not be satisfied by Kelly's answers despite his record as a well-respected military officer.
 “I don’t think there are too many freshmen that do that,” Barankin said.
 Harris was quickly viewed as a Democrat with White House potential. By 2017, Harris was feeling out a run in the Democratic primary. It wasn't her initial plan, Barankin said, but Trump's brief tenure had convinced her that perspective, particularly as a Black woman, should be represented in the Democratic primary field.
 __
 That perspective was steeped in Harris's upbringing by two immigrant parents.
 Her father, Donald Harris, who is of Afro Caribbean descent, left Jamaica to study economics at the University of California at Berkeley. Shyamala Gopalan, the daughter of an Indian diplomat who had fought for India’s independence, came to Berkeley for graduate school and stayed.
 The couple had two daughters, Kamala Devi and Maya Lakshmi. The parents told their daughters stories, she writes in her book, of being met by police with fire hoses as they marched for civil rights and against the Vietnam War, of meeting Martin Luther King Jr. when he spoke at Berkeley, of forming reading groups to study Black intellectuals.
 The couple split soon after Harris started school. The girls continued to see their father, but Gopalan became the main force in their lives. They moved to the Montreal area for several years while she worked at McGill University.
 In Berkeley, Gopalan immersed the girls in the Black community she and her ex- husband had embraced. They lived above a daycare center with posters of Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman on the walls, even as they celebrated their South Asian heritage through their names, their close ties with their mother's family in India and occasional visits to her homeland.
 They attended a Pentecostal church on Sundays and, on Thursdays, a Black cultural space called the Rainbow Sign that was a gathering spot for artists, intellectuals and activists. Many of her mother’s closest friends were Black men and women who became “aunts and uncles” to the girls, later influencing Harris’s decision to attend a historically Black university, Harris said.
 “She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as Black girls, and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud Black women,” Harris wrote of her mother.
 At Howard, Harris joined Alpha Kappa Alpha, the nation’s oldest sorority for Black women. Its network, along with those of eight other Black fraternities and sororities known as the Divine Nine, now offers Harris a powerful base of support.

How often times will NBC develop a TELEVISION show including an aircraft that inexplicably vanishes in an effort to copy the success of _Lost_? If the trailer for the upcoming Peacock original series _Departure_ is anything to pass, the response is “at least three times in less than a decade.”
  _Departure,_ a six-episode miniseries __ set to be launched on September 17th, informs the story of guest aircraft Flight 716, which “shockingly” disappears midflight, triggering a group of detectives to attempt to decipher the conspiracy prior to another aircraft vanishes. It might likewise sound a _little_ familiar if you have actually been enjoying network tv for the last years and a half.
 In 2004, _Lost_ debuted on ABC, informing the story of Oceanic Airline Flight 815, which disappears into thin air throughout a regular flight and crashes on a mystical tropical island, beginning an enormously effective flashback- reliant, conspiracy-laden TELEVISION series that would rule popular culture for several years.
  _Lost_ ended in May 2010, and the following season, NBC was currently wanting to get the audience with _The Event_, a likewise flashback-reliant, conspiracy-laden TELEVISION series that- probably by overall coincidence- ends its very first episode with Avias Airways Flight 514 disappearing into thin air. __ Despite its resemblances to _Lost_ 's "neither show nor …
