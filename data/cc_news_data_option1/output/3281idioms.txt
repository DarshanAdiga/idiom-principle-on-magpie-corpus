It suffices to note that much as man’s invincible door is important and plays significant role in defining hissuccess or failure, there is the larger than life door that is beyond human control, human comprehension and understanding. It is the ultimate and perfect door that humans don’t see. It is the door only God has the power to open or shut. It is the door to heaven.How are we expected to knock and get these doors open? Our creator, the ultimate maker of the heavens and earth has provided us strict guidelines to follow for the door to heaven to open and when these guidelines are disobeyed, an unfriendly door is waiting to open at the person’s peril. And that is hell that is said to be laden with thorns and blazing fire.

Motomiya's popular Salaryman Kintaro manga has been running on and off in Shueisha's Weekly Young Jump magazine since 1994. He restarted the series as a web manga in April of 2005, and has launched several spinoff series in Weekly Young Jump since 2009. NTT Solmare's ComicFriends Facebook-based service briefly offered the manga in English, but the service closed in 2012. The manga inspired a live-action film directed by Takashi Miike, several live- action drama series, and a 2001 anime series that Arts Magic released in North America.

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Andrew Wheeler and Boy Scouts of America (BSA) CEO and President Roger C. Mosby signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to collaborate on the creation of an EPA/BSA special award to be awarded as part of a new environmental education awards and recognition program.
 “I was an Eagle Scout growing up in Ohio, and I can definitely say scouting is where I learned to love the environment,” said EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler. “This award program challenges Scouts to earn multiple environment- related merit badges in the areas of animal study, outdoor activity, Earth science, and Public Health, and increases awareness of EPA’s accomplishments during its first 50 years.”
 “Since the very beginning of the Boy Scouts of America, conservation and environmental studies have been an integral part of our program. Scouts have provided service to their communities and to our country by helping to conserve wildlife, energy, forests, soil and water,” said Boy Scouts of America President and CEO Roger C. Mosby. “We are proud to sign the first-ever Memorandum of Understanding with the Environmental Protection Agency so that we can continue to challenge and empower Scouts to learn more about and care for the world around them.”
 “For 110 years, the Boy Scouts of America have used the outdoors as a classroom to educate youth and adults on the importance of being good stewards of our natural resources. This partnership with the Environmental Protection Agency will have a positive impact on thousands of youth and our environment," said Boy Scouts of America National Capital Area Council Scout Executive & CEO Craig Poland.
 Aligned with EPA’s 50th Anniversary Commemoration, the program includes several activities that help to fulfill EPA’s obligations under the 1990 National Environmental Education Act to promote environmental education and to provide national leadership to increase environmental literacy.
 The EPA-sponsored award will challenge Scouts to learn about, explore, and conserve the world around them as part of an awareness campaign to educate the public about EPA’s accomplishment during its first 50 years and develop the vision for the next 50 years. The program will also provide EPA with opportunities to educate BSA member councils and leadership about priority initiatives including Trash Free Waters, Winning on Reducing Food Waste, and Healthy Schools.
 The program will introduce Scouts to the breadth of EPA’s involvement in environmental protection and conservation, combining a variety of disciplines including earth sciences, animal studies, outdoor activities, and public health. To receive the EPA award, Scouts must first receive merit badges in each of these four areas and participate in an environmental/public health community service project, totaling at least six hours, as part of an approved Scouting program. Scouts may complete required steps to earn the award between April 22, 2020 and December 31, 2021, at which time the MOU may be extended.
 The Boy Scouts of America is the largest Scouting organization and one of the largest youth organizations in the United States, with about 2.1 million youth participants and about 1 million adult volunteers. The BSA was founded in 1910, and since then, about 110 million Americans have participated in BSA programs.

Lest you action-lovers out there begin to fret over all of the mushy-gushy feelings I've been talking about, don't worry: Mob Psycho 100 II delivers the goods when it comes to spectacle, and then some. The legendary fifth episode of the season, helmed by rising animation star Hakuyu Go, outdoes anything we've seen either in the previous season or in One-Punch Man, to the point of being one of the most jaw-droppingly impressive works of televised animation I've _ever_ seen, period. That says nothing about all of the _other_ standout animated sequences of the series; I'd be doubling the length of this review if I tried to list them all here. It isn't even just about action; everything from seemingly random incidental shots to the mid-roll bumpers used to split up commercial breaks have been crafted with painstaking affection and an unforgettable sense of style.

Cammack won in a Republican field of 10 candidates in the firmly Republican district that runs from Ocala to just south of Jacksonville.
 “It's a very humbling experience winning a 10-way primary,” she said. “It's a sign that there's a next generation of conservatives coming up and we're ready to start a new squad on Capitol Hill.”
 Florida will also elect a new member of Congress in a strongly GOP district in southwest Florida, where U.S. Rep. Francis Rooney is stepping down after two terms. Nine Republicans faced off in the primary to replace him in a race that was too close to call Wednesday. Mail-in ballots from overseas voters, such as those in the military, can be returned up to 10 days after election night, and they could narrow the margin and prompt an automatic recount of ballots.
 In Broward County, Sheriff Gregory Tony claimed victory in the Democratic primary over his predecessor, who was fired after the Parkland massacre. Tony replaced Scott Israel in 2019 after Gov. Ron DeSantis dismissed Israel over his handling of the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that left 17 dead.
 In a Palm Beach County congressional district, far right conservative Laura Loomer won the Republican primary to face Democratic U.S. Rep. Lois Frankel. The district is firmly Democratic, and Frankel has been a political fixture there for decades.
 While President Donald Trump has raised questions about the potential for fraud in voting by mail, he later walked back his comments, at least as far as Florida was concerned, and requested a mail-in ballot of his own.
 Democrats now have the registration edge in Florida, but independents can, as usual, make all the difference. As of June 30, Florida had nearly 4.9 million active Republican voters and more than 5.1 million active Democratic voters.
 The state has nearly 3.8 million voters who either are not registered with a party or are registered with a minor party.
 James Collins, 69, a retiree in Fort Lauderdale, said that because he was “a bit apprehensive because of the pandemic," he went to his polling station early in the morning Tuesday, donning vinyl gloves and a face mask.
 “No one was there except the poll workers. It was very quick,” Collins said.

Interestingly, the Loki set to have his own series isn't the one we grew to know, but a Loki escaped from the past, _Avengers_ -era. So what will become of Loki now, since he won't have experienced the character-defining events of _The Dark World, Ragnarok,_ and _Infinity War_? Time will tell, but now we know that Loki's heart is—often begrudgingly—in the right place, and his loyalty to his family comes through again and again. I don't think we'll have to deal with the person we met in _The Avengers_ for many hours. I suspect that the _Loki_ series will be about this Loki's evolution from villain to antihero again, and I'm on board to see how they do it afresh and with Loki in the spotlight.

He's the primary villain of _The Avengers_ , and even if his actions are being influenced by even greater forces of villainy behind the scenes, he doesn't spark much sympathy in that movie.

 # Then there were 5: Mississippi group narrows flag options
 Emily Wagster Pettus
 Associated Press
 View Comments
 _Jackson, Miss._ – A group recommending a new Mississippi state flag chose five final designs Tuesday – three with a magnolia blossom, one with a magnolia tree and one with a shield that has wavy lines representing water.
 Mississippi legislators voted in late June to retire the last state flag in the U.S. with the Confederate battle emblem that’s broadly condemned as racist.
 “When the flag came down, it was one of the great days of my life,” Reuben Anderson, chairman of a nine-member flag commission, said during Tuesday’s meeting.
 The law shelving the old flag created the commission to come up with a new design that cannot include the Confederate battle emblem and must have the phrase, “In God We Trust.”
 Four of the designs chosen Tuesday are mostly or entirely red, white and blue. One has a stylized white magnolia tree on a blue background. Most have stars representing Mississippi as the 20th state. Each includes one star made of five diamond shapes that reflect the state’s Choctaw heritage.
 The five final designs will be manufactured. Commissioners hold their next meeting Aug. 25, and those flags will be hoisted outside the Old Capitol in downtown Jackson.
 The Old Capitol is now a museum but was still the statehouse in 1894, when white supremacists in the Mississippi Legislature adopted a state flag with the Confederate battle emblem in the upper left corner. That vote reflected the backlash against political power African Americans briefly gained during Reconstruction.
 The state Supreme Court ruled in 2000 that even though the flag had remained in use, it lacked official status because state laws were updated in 1906 and sections describing the flag were not included. Mississippi residents voted in a 2001 election to keep the Confederate-themed flag, but it remained a divisive symbol in a state with a 38% Black population. All of Mississippi’s public universities and many local governments stopped flying it.
 Legislative leaders said for decades that they could not muster support to change the flag, but momentum shifted rapidly after Minneapolis police killed a Black man named George Floyd and protests against racial injustice happened across the U.S., including outside the Mississippi Governor’s Mansion. The final push to change the flag came from business, education, religion and sports leaders.
 Legislators created a nine-member commission, and that group received nearly 3,000 designs from the public. Commissioners will choose one design Sept. 2, and that will go on the Nov. 3 ballot. If voters accept the design, it will become the new Mississippi flag. If they reject it, the commission will find a new design to go on the ballot later.
 Even as the commission is working toward a new flag, some Mississippi residents are rebelling against change. Organizers of a group called Let Mississippi Vote said Monday that they are starting an initiative to put the old Confederate-themed flag and three other flag designs on the statewide ballot. But the initiative process is burdensome, and their efforts will be complicated by the coronavirus pandemic. If the initiative gets to the ballot, that election could be a year or two away. And, Mississippi could be flying a new flag by then.

Compared to the first season, Mob Psycho 100 II's animation is as crisp, playful, and almost recklessly gorgeous as ever; the bouncy and dynamic music complements the show whether it is being comedic, spooky, or bombastic; and the story expands on old themes while introducing important new ones, and pretty much every major character and plot-thread that got introduced in Season One comes back in one way or another. The voice-work continues to excel, too, both in Japanese and in English, especially for the leads. Both Setsuo Ito and Kyle McCarley are in their own ways able to capture Mob's conflicted nature without ever losing his fundamental goodness, and Reigen's deceptively simple charming con-man act comes through in spades in either Takahiro Sakurai or Chris Niosi's performances. Here's another thing that differentiates the two famous ONE anime, though: While the reception to OPM's sequel series was mixed to say the least, Mob Psycho 100 II doesn't just live up to its predecesor's lofty standards – it surpasses them in practically every way.

First of all, I love every Anker product I have purchased! I have not had one negative experience with any of their products. I have purchased Bluetooth speakers, multiple home and car chargers, and had purchased one of their portable batteries that I was very happy with. I seemed to have lost that battery, so went looking for another. This was the biggest portable battery that they offered. I jumped on it. Great price and a large capacity. I use this during hunting season, as we have no power sources for charging devices such as phones, ipads, night vision scopes, etc. The current product was charged up (takes a while) and transported to the camp. I used it to maintain my iPhone battery three times from 10% to 100% , then my son used it about the same amount and after three weeks, it is still showing full power indication. This is hands down a great purchase. I would buy another and any product that Anker makes, I trust fully to perform better than they report. Thanks, Anker for such a great product.

"The latest figures within the Black Country and West Birmingham show a 25% increase in cases this week compared to last week, which was itself around 25% higher than the week before.
 "Unlike in the earlier stages of the pandemic, most cases are concentrated within the 25-50 age group.
 "As this group is less likely to have other concurrent illness, this helps to explain why, very fortunately, there has not yet been any significant increase in people presenting either to their GP or local hospital.
 "However we know that many of these positive cases live within multi- generational households, with the age range of positive cases from one to 90 years.
 "From a clinical perspective, I fully support the current public health measures.
 "We do need to remain cautious, in order to suppress the number of new cases, and to prevent our higher risk patients, both at home and within care homes, from becoming infected.
 "If this group become infected, then it is very likely that attendances at GP surgeries, and hospital will rise. With cases still rising locally I feel the current cautious approach is the correct course of action."

 # Feds charge 22 with gun crimes, carjackings in Detroit crackdown
 George Hunter
 The Detroit News
 View Comments
 _Detroit_ — Federal officials announced Wednesday they've charged 22 people with felonies in Detroit under Operation Legend, a multi-jurisdictional initiative launched last month to fight violent crime.
 The federal charges include two people charged with carjacking, 14 charged with being felons in possession of firearms, and two charged with receiving firearms while under indictment.
 Detroit U.S. Attorney Matthew Schneider on July 29 announced Operation Legend, an expansion of an earlier local/federal program that dispatched 19 permanent U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Explosives and Firearms agents to Detroit, and 30-plus other ATF and FBI agents from across the country for temporary detail work.
 U.S. Attorney General William Barr spent several hours Tuesday with Detroit police chief James Craig, getting an update on the new initiative before touring the city in a U.S. Army helicopter.
 "I’m here to see how it’s working," Barr told The Detroit News during his visit. "It's very early on, but I wanted to see how the chief was doing; what his experience has been with it, and how we can improve things ... I think they’ve made excellent progress."
 Schneider echoed Barr's statement in a press release Wednesday announcing the early results of the initiative.
 "Operation Legend is working," he said. "The additional federal agents in Detroit have already taken high-powered assault rifles off our streets and have put armed drug dealers behind bars. If these federal agents had not come to Detroit, these violent criminals would still be terrorizing our neighborhoods."
 Craig agreed, calling the collaboration "a force multiplier."
 "I'm very appreciative of this collaborative relationship," Craig said Wednesday. "I'm excited about the early outcome, and we think as we continue, we'll start seeing a major impact on reducing violence."
 Detroit, like several big cities nationwide, has seen a spike in violence this year. Homicides are up 25% and nonfatal shootings up 51% over the same period in 2019, though overall crime is down
 Operation Legend is an extension of Operation Relentless Pursuit, an initiative
 Barr announced last year. Detroit was one of seven cities to receive part of the $71 million federal commitment to help local police fight drug trafficking, street gangs and other violent crime.
 Other cities in the program are Albuquerque, Chicago, Cleveland, Milwaukee, Memphis and St. Louis.
 Operation Legend is named after four-year-old LeGend Taliferro, who was fatally shot June 29 while sleeping in his Kansas City home.
