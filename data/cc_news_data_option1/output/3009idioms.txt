By Chandan Taparia Nifty opened positive o Friday, but failed to surpass the immediate hurdle at 11,150 level. It remained negative to rangebound for most part of the session and fell towards the 11,025 level. It formed a small-bodied bearish candle on the daily as well as on weekly scales, which indicated some selling pressure at higher levels. The index closed the week on a negative note, as it corrected from its weekly high of 11,341 to 11,026 levels and paused the winning streak of last six weeks. Mechanical indicators like RSI has seen a negative crossover from the overbought levels, with followup action on a daily scale, which doesn’t bode well for the bulls. A failure break out above the 11,300 mark and sustained selling pressure on every bounceback suggest short-term profit booking cannot be ruled out. However, the index has multiple support at 11,050 level and a hold below the 11,050 mark can confirm more decline towards 10,900 level and the 10,800-10,750 zone. On the upside, Nifty has resistance at 11,150 and then 11,250 levels. India VIX fell 2.17 per cent to 24.19 level. Any spike in volatility could trigger some decline, but overall lower VIX is ruling out any major fall in the market for the time being. Since it is the beginning of a new series, options data lay scattered at various strike prices. Maximum Put open interest stood at 11,000 followed by 10,000 levels, while maximum Call OI was at 11,500 followed by 12,000 levels. Marginal Call writing was seen at 11,500 and 11,100 levels, while there was Put writing at 10,500 and then 10,200 levels. Options data suggested a wider trading range between 10,800 and 11,400 levels. Bank Nifty failed to surpass the 21,800 level and drifted towards the 21,375 mark, but support-based buying from lower levels helped it regain losses to close on a flat note. It has been making lower tops and bottoms on the daily chart, while forming a Bearish Belt Hold pattern on the weekly scale. The index closed the last trading session near its 50-day EMA, which is a crucial level for the next movement over the coming week. Bank Nifty showed signs of tiredness and every bounce got sold into with the emergence of negative price setup on the weekly scale. As long as it holds below 22,000 level, weakness could be seen towards 21,000 and even lower levels, while on the upside, the immediate hurdles are shift to the 22,250-22,350 zone. Nifty futures closed flat to positive with a marginal gains of 0.10 per cent at 11,104 level. Positive trade setup was seen in Aurobindo Pharma, Cadila, Cipla, Sun Pharma, Balkrishna Industries, Dabur, UPL, JSW Steel, Divi’s Labs, HCL Tech, M&M; and TechM while the structures remains weak in HPCL, BHEL, ZEEL and LIC Housing Finance.

The proposed Ram temple in Ayodhya will be almost double the size of what was originally planned as its design was modified following the Supreme Court verdict last year, its architect said on Friday.The temple, to be constructed in Nagara style of architecture, will have five domes instead of two as envisaged earlier to accommodate more number of devotees, the architect said.According to him, the project is likely to be completed in the next three years once the work commences.The 'bhoomi pujan' (ground-breaking) ceremony of the temple in Ayodhya is scheduled to be held on August 5, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to attend, as told by the members of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra, a trust formed to oversee its construction."The design of the temple was modified after the Supreme Court verdict. Now it will be almost double the size of what was originally planned," architect Chandrakant Sompura, who has designed it, told PTI."It will now have a shikhara (tower) over the sanctum sanctorum and five domes instead of the earlier plan of two domes. The height of the temple will also be more than what was in the previous plan," he said.In November last year, the Supreme Court had paved the way for the construction of Ram temple by at the disputed site at Ayodhya, and directed the Centre to allot an alternative five-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a new mosque at a "prominent" place in the holy town in Uttar Pradesh. Sompura, 77, who comes from a family of temple architects that have designed over 200 such structures, said that he was asked to prepare a design for the Ram temple by late leader of the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), Ashok Singhal, around 30 years ago.He said designing the Ram temple was an uphill task 30 years back, as he had to prepare drawings using his footsteps as the unit of measurement."When I first visited the site in Ayodhya in 1990, nothing was allowed to be taken inside the premises due to security concerns, not even a measurement tape and I had to measure with my footsteps," Sompura said. Based on his design of the temple, the VHP had started preparation for its construction in the 1990s by setting up a unit of carving of stones in Ayodhya, he said."However, after the Supreme Court verdict in favour of construction at the Ramjamabhoomi site, the temple design was changed," he said. "Now there will be five domes. It has two reasons- first, there is no dearth of land for the temple now and the second one is that after so much of publicity, we expect that a large number of devotees will visit the temple everyday and the size has been increased to accommodate them," he said.According to Sompura, his son Ashish had presented this revised plan before the trust in June, which was approved. Ashish Sompura will look after the construction of the temple, although his father will have the final say on it. The septuagenarian architect said that he has designed many temples, but the Ayodhya Ram temple project is special to him just as the Somnath temple was for his grandfather Prabhashankar Sompura, who designed and oversaw its reconstruction."This project is special as it is being built at the birthplace of Lord Ram. We have to ensure that it should be the best. With five domes, which is rare, it will set an example. It will be developed as the best place of worship in terms of temple architecture," he said."The temple is likely to be completed in next three years after its work begins," he added.Sompura said his family designs temples in Nagara style and the structure in Ayodhya will also be built in that style of North Indian temple architecture.

BERLIN (AP) — Another 22 children with medical needs who have been living in migrant camps in Greece arrived in Germany on Friday along with their close relatives, the German government said. In all, 90 people were on board a flight that landed at Berlin's Schoenefeld airport, the interior ministry said. It added that 46 of them were from Afghanistan and 18 from Syria, while the rest were Iraqis, Palestinians, Somalis, Congolese and Cameroonians. They will be shared out among several German states. Friday's transfer is part of a wider effort to get hundreds of vulnerable children out of camps on the Greek islands, and comes a week after 18 children and their families — 83 people in all — were flown to Kassel, in central Germany. Germany says it has agreed to take in a total of 243 children “who need medical treatment” from Greece, as well their closest relatives, 928 people in all. In April, a group of 47 unaccompanied children evacuated from the overcrowded Greek camps landed in Germany. Luxembourg and Portugal also have taken in minors from Greece, and other European Union countries have agreed to, as well, in principle.

Britain's health secretary defended the government's abrupt re- imposition of restrictions on social life across a swath of northern England on Friday, saying it was important to clamp down quickly on new outbreaks of Covid-19.Matt Hancock said that while it's not the "sort of decision that anybody would want to take,'' the government had no choice."It is important to move quickly because the virus spreads and you've got to make sure you do everything you can do keep ahead of it," he told Sky News.Under the new restrictions, people from different households in Greater Manchester, England's second largest metropolitan area, have been asked to not meet indoors. The order also applies to the surrounding areas of Lancashire and West Yorkshire counties, affecting more than 4 million people in all.Hancock said data showed the coronavirus was being spread primarily between households.He told the BBC that "one of the terrible things about this virus is it thrives on the sort of social contact that makes life worth living."Opposition politicians supported the latest move but criticized the government for announcing the restrictions in a tweet from Hancock late Thursday, just two hours before they came into force at midnight.Labour Party business spokeswoman Lucy Powell said the "bolt out of the blue" approach was "not the way to build confidence and to take people with you and maximize compliance with these steps."The affected region has a large Muslim population, and the restrictions coincide with the Eid al-Adha holiday, where many people would normally gather in each other's homes.Hancock said "my heart goes out to the Muslim communities in these areas because I know how important the Eid celebrations are.""I'm very grateful to the local Muslim leaders, the imams in fact, across the country who've been working so hard to find a way to have Covid-secure celebrations," he said. "For instance, celebrating Eid in parks where there's more space available and, of course, outdoors is safer than indoors."The measures are the second batch of regional restrictions imposed to try to curb a second wave of the virus in Britain, following a stricter local lockdown in the central England city of Leicester. The government said restaurants, pubs, shops and hairdressers in Leicester could reopen from Monday, more than a month after they were closed amid a surge in cases.Britain's official coronavirus death toll stands at just over 46,000, the third-highest total in the world after the United States and Brazil.

Sunil Bharti Mittal, chairman of Bharti Airtel, has called upon the government to review the high taxes levied upon the telecom sector. The industry leader has asked the government to ensure that the sector aids in growth and development but not at its own cost. It is also time for the government to now ensure that this industry which has had its ups and down is now given due attention in the area of levies and taxes. Taxes have generally been very high on this industry, said Sunil Bharti Mittal, chairman of Bharti Airtel. It is important that this is reviewed thoroughly and telecommunication resources like spectrum and levies should not become a source for the exchequer but should become a force multiplier in ensuring that the economic momentum becomes faster and gets accelerated. So the government can earn its dues from other Industries who are going to be riding on the back of this wonderful industry, Mittal added in an industry event Mittal's comments come on the back of adjusted gross revenue dues (AGR) that has plagued the sector and been a battlefield between the government and private telcos. Airtel, the second most hit by blow of AGR dues has to pay the government a balance of Rs 25,976 crore. Now awaiting Supreme Court's directions , the AGR provisions were the main reason for Airtel to post a loss of Rs 15,933 crore for April- June quarter . Mittal in an industry event to celebrate 25 years of the sector highlighted how the number of operators have moved from 2 to 12 over this period of time and today we have back to three plus one operator serving the vast land of India . The telecom industry under a debt of more than Rs seven lakh crore has seen exit of players, mergers of Vodafone India with Idea Cellular and bankruptcies of Reliance Communications and Aircel. Mittal along with other industry leaders have backed the goal of creating more home grown products across sectors. I also feel the time has come for India to take a lead in the area of local manufacturing, Prime Minister’s vision of Atma Nirbhar is giving us all a clarion call to ensure that more and more value added is done in India for the Telecom networks for mobile devices and of course accelerate even more our software abilities and the country, said the chairman. He pointed out the next generation of growth will come from 5G and IoT and wil impact services across. What we really are looking forward in the next 25 years is IoT connectivity, low-latency connectivity, a full 5G enable network across the country ensuring that digital payments online activities, e- commerce, health services, agriculture services, the government subsidies going into mobile accounts are all effectively done through a robust mobile network, he added. Interestingly, rival Reliance Jio had in mid -July announced that it has developed a 5G ecosystem and once spectrum is allocated, the telco can become a global 5G network provider to other operators . 5G spectrum is expected to be auctioned next year but Airtel has said the prices are too steep. Telecommunications will play a very vital role in ensuring that this digital dream of a prime minister is met and met with a first-rate telecommunication network, which is leading edge on technology, which will ensure that when 5G comes to India. The Telecom operators will take a front end role in connecting all that is required to be connected in the country, Mittal added. India's affordable tariff rates which provide access to a lot of services and data was also noted by Mittal. We believe that the tariffs that we now apply in India are perhaps the most affordable anywhere in the world. Customers are enjoying over 15 GB of data usage per month at the most affordable rates anywhere in the globe for less than Rs 200 people are accessing their applications, music, entertainment, vital government services, DVD Access, financial inclusion, he said .

Officers late Thursday night responded to a report that a man with a history of schizophrenia was threatening his mother with a knife, Brunswick police said in a news release. After attempting to contact the occupants of the home, police entered and they said William Sears, 30, charged at them. Officers opened fire, fatally wounding Sears. The investigation revealed that Sears “had attacked and killed his mother with a knife,” police said. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Her name has not been released. No other information was available. The Ohio Attorney General's Bureau of Criminal Investigation was investigating the incident.

Britain's health secretary defended the government's abrupt re-imposition of restrictions on social life across a swath of northern England on Friday, saying it was important to clamp down quickly on new outbreaks of Covid-19.
 Matt Hancock said that while it's not the "sort of decision that anybody would want to take,'' the government had no choice.
 "It is important to move quickly because the virus spreads and you've got to make sure you do everything you can do keep ahead of it," he told Sky News.
 Under the new restrictions, people from different households in Greater Manchester, England's second largest metropolitan area, have been asked to not meet indoors. The order also applies to the surrounding areas of Lancashire and West Yorkshire counties, affecting more than 4 million people in all.
   
   
 Hancock said data showed the coronavirus was being spread primarily between households.
 He told the BBC that "one of the terrible things about this virus is it thrives on the sort of social contact that makes life worth living."
 Opposition politicians supported the latest move but criticized the government for announcing the restrictions in a tweet from Hancock late Thursday, just two hours before they came into force at midnight.
 Labour Party business spokeswoman Lucy Powell said the "bolt out of the blue" approach was "not the way to build confidence and to take people with you and maximize compliance with these steps."
 The affected region has a large Muslim population, and the restrictions coincide with the Eid al-Adha holiday, where many people would normally gather in each other's homes.
 Hancock said "my heart goes out to the Muslim communities in these areas because I know how important the Eid celebrations are."
 "I'm very grateful to the local Muslim leaders, the imams in fact, across the country who've been working so hard to find a way to have Covid-secure celebrations," he said. "For instance, celebrating Eid in parks where there's more space available and, of course, outdoors is safer than indoors."
 The measures are the second batch of regional restrictions imposed to try to curb a second wave of the virus in Britain, following a stricter local lockdown in the central England city of Leicester. The government said restaurants, pubs, shops and hairdressers in Leicester could reopen from Monday, more than a month after they were closed amid a surge in cases.
 Britain's official coronavirus death toll stands at just over 46,000, the third-highest total in the world after the United States and Brazil.

India has now restricted imports of Chinese colour televisions to encourage domestic manufacturing after banning mobile applications and excluding firms from China from participating in public procurement tenders, two officials with direct knowledge of the matter said.
 The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), an arm of the commerce and industry, issued a notification on late Thursday evening amending the import policy of colour television (TV) from free to restricted category.
 "Import of colour TV is now in the restricted category, which would necessitate an importer to seek import license from the government. The main purpose of this move is to check influx of China TVs," one of the officials said requesting anonymity.
 India has a Rs 15,000 crore TV industry and over 36% of that is imported primarily from China and South East Asia, he added.
   
   
 India has taken a series of actions against China after the violent brawl between Chinese and Indian soldiers on June 15 along the Line of Actual Control in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh. Twenty Indian Army personnel were killed that day.
 On June 29, the Narendra Modi government announced a ban on 59 mostly Chinese mobile applications such as TikTok, UC Browser and WeChat, citing security concerns. On July 23, it restricted public procurements by the bidders from countries that share a land border with it on the ground of national security.
 A second official said that some Chinese TV sets were routed through a third country with which India has a free trade agreement (FTA). "This move will also curb such illegal trade," he said.
 Besides China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Korea, Indonesia, Thailand and Germany are major exporters of colour TVs.
 "Many such items enter Indian market taking advantage of ASEAN India FTA imports at reduced or zero duty, putting our domestic industry at a disadvantage. Such imports cannot be controlled through increased duty rates. Hence, the government is taking measures such as non-duty actions like import restrictions," the first official cited above said.
 ASEAN FTA was signed during the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) regime in 2009 with Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
 India has created necessary infrastructure and made arrangements to produce electronic items in cost-effective manner under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self-reliant India Imitative), and invite global manufacturers to set up units in India, the second official said.
 India's production of electronics grew from $29 billion in 2014 to $70 billion in 2019.
 "Phased Manufacturing Programme (PMP) for TVs is underway and specified parts like open-cell, chips on films, Printed Circuit Boards Assembly (PCBA ) are exempted from duty. Hence, India is ready for a shift of manufacturing to India with cost-effective imports of essential parts," the first official said.
 The officials said Thursday's decision to restrict the influx of TV sets was taken after extensive consultations with the domestic industry that aims to promote 'Make in India', create jobs and provide goods at a comparable rate to the consumer.
 "As there is no 'ban' and only a 'restriction' being imposed, there is a possibility of such imports; however, with prior approval of the Directorate General of Foreign Trade," Divakar Vijayasarathy, the founder and managing partner at consultancy firm DVS Advisors LLP, said.
 "The procedural aspects of acquiring this permit [licence]; however, would be tedious considering the stakes involved. There shall be transition provisions in place for import orders already being given or goods in transit," he added.

The proposed Ram temple in Ayodhya will be almost double the size of what was originally planned as its design was modified following the Supreme Court verdict last year, its architect said on Friday.
 The temple, to be constructed in Nagara style of architecture, will have five domes instead of two as envisaged earlier to accommodate more number of devotees, the architect said.
 According to him, the project is likely to be completed in the next three years once the work commences.
 The 'bhoomi pujan' (ground-breaking) ceremony of the temple in Ayodhya is scheduled to be held on August 5, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to attend, as told by the members of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra, a trust formed to oversee its construction.
   
   
 "The design of the temple was modified after the Supreme Court verdict. Now it will be almost double the size of what was originally planned," architect Chandrakant Sompura, who has designed it, told PTI.
 "It will now have a shikhara (tower) over the sanctum sanctorum and five domes instead of the earlier plan of two domes. The height of the temple will also be more than what was in the previous plan," he said.
 In November last year, the Supreme Court had paved the way for the construction of Ram temple by at the disputed site at Ayodhya, and directed the Centre to allot an alternative five-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a new mosque at a "prominent" place in the holy town in Uttar Pradesh.
 Sompura, 77, who comes from a family of temple architects that have designed over 200 such structures, said that he was asked to prepare a design for the Ram temple by late leader of the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), Ashok Singhal, around 30 years ago.
 He said designing the Ram temple was an uphill task 30 years back, as he had to prepare drawings using his footsteps as the unit of measurement.
 "When I first visited the site in Ayodhya in 1990, nothing was allowed to be taken inside the premises due to security concerns, not even a measurement tape and I had to measure with my footsteps," Sompura said.
 Based on his design of the temple, the VHP had started preparation for its construction in the 1990s by setting up a unit of carving of stones in Ayodhya, he said.
 "However, after the Supreme Court verdict in favour of construction at the Ramjamabhoomi site, the temple design was changed," he said.
 "Now there will be five domes. It has two reasons- first, there is no dearth of land for the temple now and the second one is that after so much of publicity, we expect that a large number of devotees will visit the temple everyday and the size has been increased to accommodate them," he said.
 According to Sompura, his son Ashish had presented this revised plan before the trust in June, which was approved.
 Ashish Sompura will look after the construction of the temple, although his father will have the final say on it.
 The septuagenarian architect said that he has designed many temples, but the Ayodhya Ram temple project is special to him just as the Somnath temple was for his grandfather Prabhashankar Sompura, who designed and oversaw its reconstruction.
 "This project is special as it is being built at the birthplace of Lord Ram. We have to ensure that it should be the best. With five domes, which is rare, it will set an example. It will be developed as the best place of worship in terms of temple architecture," he said.
 "The temple is likely to be completed in next three years after its work begins," he added.
 Sompura said his family designs temples in Nagara style and the structure in Ayodhya will also be built in that style of North Indian temple architecture.

Hence, India is ready for a shift of manufacturing to India with cost-effective imports of essential parts," the first official said.The officials said Thursday's decision to restrict the influx of TV sets was taken after extensive consultations with the domestic industry that aims to promote 'Make in India', create jobs and provide goods at a comparable rate to the consumer."As there is no 'ban' and only a 'restriction' being imposed, there is a possibility of such imports; however, with prior approval of the Directorate General of Foreign Trade," Divakar Vijayasarathy, the founder and managing partner at consultancy firm DVS Advisors LLP, said. "The procedural aspects of acquiring this permit [licence]; however, would be tedious considering the stakes involved. There shall be transition provisions in place for import orders already being given or goods in transit," he added.

 "My knee injury never stopped me but at the time I was about to leave Preston to make a big-money move to a top Premier League club.
 “I got injured and two years later I had to come back and pretty much start from the bottom - for him to just even bring that up, it shows what a guy he is."

Asking yourself that question would be Burgess’s advice. “Takeaway packaging, plastic or not, has flooded the market,” she says, as even restaurants that previously didn’t offer takeaway food now do. Carry your own cutlery if you’re out and about to reduce the use of disposable versions. “If you’re using an online platform, click off the single-use cutlery and small sachets of ketchup option,” she says, if there is one. “That’s a quick win.” She knows of a coffee shop that accepts customers’ own containers so it’s worth trying to encourage others to do the same. “If you can get out and pick up your food, ask them if they can use your plastic container if you take it in for them to pack.”

Nico Hulkenberg made an unexpected return to Formula One on Friday, stepping in at Racing Point after Sergio Perez tested positive for the coronavirus ahead of the British Grand Prix on Sunday.The 32-year-old Hulkenberg lost his seat at Renault for this season so was available when Racing Point team principal Otmar Szafnauer made the call.The German was immediately back in action for the first time since November, driving in first practice on Friday at Silverstone, where no fans are attending due to the pandemic restrictions."I was on my way to the Nurburgring for another racing project when the call from Otmar came," Hulkenberg said. "That was less than 24 hours ago, so it feels a bit surreal for me right now, but I like a good challenge and this is certainly one."It's obviously a difficult situation for Racing Point and Checo. He's a buddy of mine, an old teammate and I wish him a speedy recovery. I'll step in and try do the best I can for the team."It will be Hulkenberg's 178th Grand Prix."Having to find a replacement for Sergio at short notice is no easy task," Szafnauer said, "but in Nico we've got a fantastic supersub who the team knows very well. He's certainly being thrown in at the deep end, but he's a fast learner and I'm sure he will get up to speed quickly."Perez believes he picked up the virus on a trip home to Mexico between the Hungarian and British races to visit his mother after she had an accident.He tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday and has to go into isolation which should also rule him out of the following weekend's additional race at Silverstone."I'm extremely sad -- definitely one of the saddest days in my career," Perez said. "The amount of preparation we put into this weekend to be 100% ready, I knew I had a great car underneath me, that the team had done a fantastic job."Reporting no symptoms of the virus, Perez said it was a reminder how vulnerable everyone is to becoming infected."After Hungary I took a private plane to Mexico to see my mum for two days because she had a big accident. So as soon as she left hospital I was able to see her," he said. "Then I came back to Europe, same way, with all the protocols in place. And I just got it, I don't know from where."

The focus has shifted to how — or if — the Olympics will happen next year. The pandemic will call the shots. How will Tokyo remain safe with 15,400 Olympic and Paralympic athletes arriving in the country? Will there be any foreign fans, or only Japanese? Or will there be any fans at all? What about staff, media, volunteers, or officials who work behind the scenes?

Is our ‘in the room’ brand of programming doomed? I first heard of its death sentence three decades ago. OK, series do get shorter – our first, about the end of the British Empire, had 14 episodes; now we settle for three. The BBC still pays no more than half and it takes longer to find the US broadcaster to help fund the rest. I’m halfway through our next series, Trump on the World Stage, due for broadcast just before the inauguration. No, I can’t tell you which US broadcaster will show that one, but watch this space.
