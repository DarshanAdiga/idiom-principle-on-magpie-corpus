I have contained myself as long as I can in regard to pastor James Parker. Most all of us are trying our best to follow the governor’s orders during this virus pandemic. We happen to be one of the states with the lowest number of cases, but now Union County has its first COVID-19 related death.
 Parker, your large gatherings could eventually bring more death to a lot of us older folks as well as younger ones. When you say, "It’s the right thing to do," and you will continue doing it, by whose standards is that, and just what does that mean?
 If you really want to do the right thing, Parker, have all your people stay home. God can hear their prayers from home very well.
 If it’s the absence of the collection plate you missed, brother Parker, I’m sure your congregation will be happy to mail their contributions to you. Please show some consideration and compassion for the rest of us and do the really right thing.

Sources within the club insist that McCourt is committed to a "long-term" project at the Velodrome.
 Marseille finished second in the Ligue 1 season, which was shortened due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 That performance allowed the club with the biggest crowds in the French game to return to the Champions League for the first time since 2013.
 However, financial difficulties almost saw coach Andre Villas-Boas leave the club and earlier this month they were fined three million euros by UEFA for breaching financial fair play rules.
 They will also have to hand back 15 per cent of the prize money due for their participation in next season's Champions League.
 The punishment is a result of huge losses in recent seasons under McCourt's stewardship, including a reported 91 million-euro deficit in 2018-19.
 Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is still believed to be close to securing an 80 percent stake in English Premier League side Newcastle United for £300 million (US$338 million).

It’s easy to pick holes in Orange’s simple single-pivot suspension design, and web warriors love to poke fun at the hand-laid beads of weld that don’t form perfectly symmetrical fish scales. Hitting just two corners on the Stage Evo though, and there’s no disputing the ride quality. This bike simply rips. The firm compression on the Pike fork feels perfectly balanced with the tighter rear suspension, and when you’re dodging trees, the Stage Evo rides light, feels agile and remains blissfully calm. Yes, it’s easy to ride beyond the physical limits of the travel, but that’s what makes the Stage Evo such an engaging bike on regular terrain. The increased support from the rear translates to a more planted front end, so even though the size L Stage Evo sports a 480mm reach, the front never pushes through turns or loses traction unexpectedly, which just encourages you to push even harder. Balance is the name of the game here, and Orange has nailed it on the new Stage Evo LE.

The new Stage Evo frame isn’t purely reductionist though. Orange has increased the pivot height to generate more anti-squat while carving out the shock mount on the downtube so the nose of the shock sits a little lower to increase progression. Taken together, these subtle changes offer more support, so even though the Stage Evo is shy on travel, it doesn’t rip through it in the blink of an eye. This extra support in the rear suspension gives you a much bigger window of adjustment – previously you’d set a higher spring pressure for more bottom out control. Does the new layout have enough progression to fit a coil shock? I’ve not had time to try it, but at 30 per cent sag on the Super Deluxe Ultimate shock, the progression felt spot on with no harsh bottom out. That’s not to say the travel felt bottomless, because the trade-off for the increased anti-squat is that the ride feels harsher on bigger hits. So if you’ve got the legs, or mostly ride flat terrain, upping the chainring size from the stock 32t will really help in that department. Just don’t expect it to feel as snappy when you get on the gas.

_Roma, 26 giu 12:47 - (Agenzia Nova)_ \- Tim ha ringraziato l’Autorità giudiziaria e alla Polizia di Stato per aver portato a termine con successo l’indagine relativa alla divulgazione e commercio abusivo di dati anagrafici e numeri telefonici della clientela. Stando al relativo comunicato stampa, grazie ai provvedimenti adottati dal Gip del tribunale di Roma si chiude oggi una “vicenda grave che proprio Tim aveva denunciato alla Procura di Roma un anno fa, a seguito di una accurata indagine interna”. A seguito dei provvedimenti decisi dalla magistratura, prosegue la nota, Tim ha subito proceduto con misure disciplinari nei confronti del personale coinvolto e si costituirà parte civile nel processo in quanto parte lesa. I fatti oggetto dell’indagine, scrive Tim, rappresentano da tempo un fenomeno grave che arreca danni significativi non solo al Gruppo ma all’intero settore delle telecomunicazioni, alterando le regole della libera concorrenza. La società ha infine precisato che, oltre ad aver collaborato fattivamente con gli inquirenti nel corso di tutto il periodo dell’indagine, ha inviato segnalazioni sul tema all’Agcom al fine di proteggere al meglio la sua clientela.

But let’s stay focused on the numbers of the big wheeler. At 1,231mm, the wheelbase is almost 30mm longer than the old Stage 5. The 65.1º head angle makes it almost 1.5º slacker, while the BB height gets chopped down by 10mm to 325mm. So even though travel has also been reduced by 15mm the dynamic BB height on the Stage Evo is still going to be lower than before. It’s not so low that you are constantly clipping pedals though, so if it’s a ground hugging ride you’re after, offset set shock hardware is the way to go.
