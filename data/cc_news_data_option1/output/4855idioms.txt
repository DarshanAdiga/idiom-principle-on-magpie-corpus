Another far-left genius, his eyes brightening, chimed in.  "I believe you're onto something here!  We could run a really old white guy for our candidate, someone who shows signs of early-onset dimension, and choose as his running mate someone who we can pass off as non-white and who dropped out of the primaries early because she couldn't garner any electoral interest.  And she'll have a sour personality, to boot!"

The latest data - which looks at the seven day rolling average Covid infection rate between Monday, November 16 and Sunday, November 22 - Basildon, Essex, remains the worst affected area in Essex.
 Gavin Callaghan - the leader of Basildon Council - said yesterday in a reply to a tweet that he's thankful the area wasn't placed into a Tier 3 lockdown.
 Areas with similar rates to Basildon, like Slough in Berkshire and Maidstone in Kent, have been placed into the highest tier of lockdown, and figures in Basildon continue to rise.

Ten days after the EPA finalized the coal ash rule, Georgia Power spent $1.3 million to acquire 141 acres of land near Plant Bowen in the northwest part of the state. A 4-acre sinkhole there had opened at the plant's coal ash pond years earlier, releasing over 2 million gallons of arsenic-laced ash and water into a tributary of the Etowah River. In the following years, the utility also purchased 32 acres near the Plant Arkwright site in Macon; 55 acres near Plant Wansley in west Georgia; and over 1,000 acres near Plant Scherer, the nation's largest coal-fired plant, in central Georgia.

_In respect of the SIHPL contractual claimants BVI and Cronje & others who are current employees and managers of PPH, SIHPL proposes that their settlement consideration be entirely in the form of PPH shares at a deemed settlement price of ZAR13.5 per share, provided that they agree to a three year lock up restriction on the sale of those PPH shares from the effective date of the settlement. The Company estimates that approximately 345 million PPH shares (or 9.3 per cent of the total PPH issued share capital) will be transferred to SIHPL contractual claimants assuming BVI and Cronje & others take up their option to be paid entirely in PPH shares.“_

The more sci-fi side of green agricultural tech isn't exactly hidden: If you know where to look you can find videos of the machines from companies hoping to sell the farm-bots of the future. The prototypes run the gamut from wonderfully menacing to captivatingly ingenious. On top of that, the creators (the would-be Elon Musks of agriculture) tend to pair these scenes with unabashedly cinematic-style soundtracks.

In conclusion, civil disobedience can be very effective in changing public opinion on an issue, like the Vietnam War, and thus, force a change in governmental policy. Indeed, as a free people, Americans are correct to protest anything that impinges on their Creator-granted liberties, violates the Bill of Rights or the U.S. Constitution. Any laws that are unfair, immoral, or unconstitutional should be protested to the hilt because to obey such laws or acts indicates a moral turpitude of the Government. Thus, to ignore such laws or acts would reveal the abandonment of our responsibility as Americans to pass our rights and freedoms onto the next generation and that in and of itself, is intolerable.

Until recently, the waste largely had been regulated by the states instead of the federal government, in part thanks to pressure from industry groups fighting stricter environmental protections. Some states, like Maryland, enacted tough standards to dispose of the waste. Georgia, however, did not follow suit, despite a growing body of science warning about the potential for unlined ponds full of contaminants to pollute aquifers that supply water to homes with drinking wells.

CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — British-Australian academic Kylie Moore-Gilbert has arrived back in Australia and will soon reunite with her family after more than two years in an Iranian prison. Moore-Gilbert was met by public health officials and members of the Australian Defense Force after disembarking from a plane at Canberra Airport. Foreign Minister Marise Payne has said she will have to undergo quarantine because of coronavirus concerns. The academic was freed earlier this week after 804 days behind bars on spying charges. She was released in exchange for three Iranians who were held in Thailand.

Second, the people involved were so distressed by the edicts, laws, and/or demands of those in power, that they sacrificed their personal freedom, their personal well-being, and their personal finances by going against the grain and protesting. They went out, in dangerous areas, like MLK's march or the recent march in D.C., because they believed in truth, justice, and freedom. Not just freedom for themselves but for the population at large.
