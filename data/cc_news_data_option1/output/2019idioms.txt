The predecessor of Sweden’s state epidemiologist has broken her silence on the country’s controversial coronavirus strategy, saying she now believes the authorities should have put in place tougher restrictions in the early stages of the pandemic to bring the virus under control.      Annika Linde, who oversaw Sweden’s response to swine flu and Sars as state epidemiologist from 2005 to 2013, had until now expressed support for her country’s approach under her successor, Anders Tegnell.      But she has now become the first member of the public health establishment to break ranks, saying she has changed her mind as a result of Sweden’s relatively high death toll compared with that of its neighbours, Denmark, Norway, and Finland.

 CTD’s talk leader _Dr. Phil_ — which scored its best ratings in more than two years in the prior week with the show’s exclusive two-part interview with Cleveland kidnapping survivor Michelle Knight — dropped back 11% to a 3.2, still the second-highest rated week of the show’s season.
 Warner Bros.’ _Ellen_ , which had sole possession of second place in the previous session, dipped 3% to a 2.9, returning it to a tie with Disney/ABC’s _Live with Kelly and Michael_ , which added 4% from last week and 12% from last year.

Katie Couric on Monday announced that she would be Yahoo’s new global anchor, starting early next year. A decision on whether she will continue to host her talk show is still pending, depending on whether Couric wants to do it, whether the show's costs can be brought in line with daytime's economic environment, and whether enough time slots exist for it to remain on the air next year outside of the non-ABC Owned markets.
 CTD’s _Rachael Ray_ rallied 7% to a 1.5, that show’s best performance in 29 weeks.
 Debmar-Mercury’s _Wendy Williams_ and NBCU’s _Steve Wilkos_ , which marked its 1000th episode on Nov. 22, both remained at their season-highs: 1.4.

 Further back, CTD’s _The Test_ was flat at a 0.6 in households, while in late- night CTD’s _Arsenio Hall_ held firm at a 0.7 for the sixth week in a row.
 Elsewhere, CTD’s J _udge Judy_ continued to defy gravity in its 18th year, setting a new season record for the third week in a row, and advancing 3% to a 7.6, making it syndication’s highest-rated show for the 12th consecutive week.
 Warner Bros.’ _People’s Court_ also hit a new season-high 1.9, up 6%. Twentieth’s _Divorce Court_ climbed 13% to a new season-high 1.7. Warner Bros.’ _Judge Mathis_ and Twentieth’s _Judge Alex_ both were unchanged at a 1.6, while MGM’s rookie _Paternity Court_ added 11% to a 1.0.

 Warner Bros.’ _Extra_ , which was the top magazine gainer in the previous session, receded 6% to a 1.6, tying CTD’s _omg! Insider_ , which added 7% to a new season high, that show’s highest rating since being reformatted last January.

Debmar- Mercury’s _Family Feud,_ with host Steve Harvey, continued to advance, gaining 4% to a new season high 5.2. Disney/ABC’s _Who Wants to be a Millionaire_ , with this slipped 5% from its season high set in the previous week to a 2.1.
 Among the rookie off-net sitcoms, Twentieth’s _Modern Family_ was flat at a 4.6. Twentieth’s _The Cleveland Show_ picked up 5% to a 2.1. Warner Bros.’ _The Middle_ recovered 7% to a 1.5, while SPT’s _Community_ , which does not count its cable run in its syndie rating, remained at a 0.4.

 Ripley was then taken to the homicide bureau where she was read her Miranda rights.
 "These statements ... contradicted the statements of witnesses and the video footage obtained from the area," police said in the affidavit. "Upon being confronted with this information, the defendant recanted her initial story including that she had been robbed."
 Video footage shows Ripley pushing the victim into a canal around 7:30 p.m. Thursday. Nearby residents heard screaming, found Alejandro in the canal and rescued him, Rundle said.

State broadcast associations have told the FCC that unless it imposes online political file requirements on cable and satellite operators, it should not do so on them.      Starting in August 2012, the FCC required the top for network affiliated stations in the top 50 markets to post their political files online and set a July 1, 2014 date for the rest of the nation's TV stations to follow suit, pending its review of comments on how the top-50 requirement was working out.      The FCC is now collecting and reviewing those comments. When it opened the comment window in July, the FCC reportedly had received 66,000-plus political file documents, while the general online public file — which includes other information like kids TV programming requirements — had generated 2.5 million page views. The file has been used by campaign finance reform groups — notably the Sunlight Foundation — to track spending and spotlight disclosure issues.      The state associations, in a filing this month at the commission, said the FCC should defer that July 2014 deadline until it applies the requirement to cable and satellite, and repeal the requirement for the top 50 stations in the interim as well.      "As long as the Commission refuses to apply the Online Political File Rule to cable and satellite providers as well, which largely compete with television broadcasters for the same viewers and advertisers, the Commission should, as a matter of fundamental fairness consistent with principles of administrative law, defer that tentative deadline. For the same reason, the Commission should also, on its own motion, lift the current, broadcast-only, asymmetric Online Political File Rule at least until it requires cable and satellite operators to post online the same type of competitively sensitive information."      Broadcasters have complained that having to post the spot prices online could give its competitors for political ad dollars an unfair advantage.      The FCC back in April 2012 voted to require stations to upload their public files to an FCC database for online public inspection, including EEO files, joint sales agreements, and other info, but it decided to phase-in the political file requirement. Stations have always been required to keep the information in a public file viewable by the public, but that was usually a filing cabinet that required a visit to the station.
