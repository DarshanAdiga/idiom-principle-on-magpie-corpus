 Khurshid TV's news director Jawed Farhad confirmed the attack, which left the station's white minibus with extensive damage to its front end.
 "The target of the blast was the vehicle of Khurshid private TV," the interior ministry said in a statement.
 It was the second such attack targeting Khurshid employees in less than a year.
 In August 2019, two passers-by were killed when a "sticky bomb" -- a type of homemade explosive attached to vehicles with magnets -- struck a similar Khurshid TV van in an unclaimed attack.

Maybe wine isn't your drink of choice, but it's always nice to have a few bottles around. Ninety Plus Cellars ships rebranded wines from reputable wineries every three months. Meaning, they purchase a small percentage of bottles from vineyards with histories of highly rated wines and repackage them.
 This way, you get three or six standout bottles each quarter for a fraction of their cost. For $50 per quarter and up, you can get the three best wines of the season, six reds, or a mix of six reds, whites and occasional roses and/or bubbly. It recently added the option to choose a dozen reds or a mix of a dozen bottles, in case you want to stock up for a party or the holiday season. Some of the older, legacy wine club companies still do four shipments a year, but we think Ninety Plus offers a better value and has a more user-friendly website.

No online wine tasting quiz here. Vinebox lets you try before you buy with its quarterly wine subscription. Instead of getting stuck with entire bottles of random wines, you get nine small vials delivered every three months.
 The twist-top vials hit the middle ground between a tasting pour and a standard glass pour. This way, you can try these wines and maybe even have enough to pair with a meal or just unwind at the end of the day. You can also double your box -- saving 10% -- if you want to get a friend or significant other in on the tasting experience. Vinebox uses a special rebottling process to preserve the wine's taste, and each tube can keep the wine good for up to three years.
 Until July of last year, Vinebox was a monthly service. The customer experience has changed only slightly, but the wine curation is focused even more on discovery than before. You still have control over your preferred red to white ratio for your boxes.
 If you really like one or more of your testers, you can buy a whole bottle on the Vinebox website (a perk for subscribers only). If you sign up for a quarterly subscription ($72 and up per quarter), you get a $15 credit towards a full bottle every three months. If you pay for the full year, you'll get a $30 credit each quarter. We also like that it's really easy to skip a month or cancel your subscription right from your online account.

Two weeks before Gov. Gavin Newsom would allow Los Angeles County restaurants to open, I was desperate for a meal with strangers — part of what brought me to Bakersfield in the first place. So I accepted an invitation to join Jessica and her friends. I walked across the baking asphalt and ordered the Thursday special, a tri-tip sandwich with pepper jack cheese, and sweet potato fries to-go, on the manager’s recommendation. For a to-go drink, I asked for the first cocktail I saw, a Baja on the Rocks (“It’s a rum thing.”).

Amazon Flex promises drivers between $15 and $19 per hour, plus tips. Theoretically, that’s more than you’d earn at UPS, but there’s a huge difference. At Amazon Flex you are an independent contractor, so you pay both employer and employee contributions to Social Security and Medicare. You are also responsible for all of your expenses — gas, maintenance, insurance and repairs.
 Amazon Flex drivers are presented with time “blocks” that offer a minimum and maximum pay. You have the ability to accept or ignore these offers. For instance, the company may offer a two-hour block paying $36 to $50. The minimum you can earn if you take this block is $36. However, if you receive tips, you’ll earn more.
 The catch: Each block contains a set number of deliveries that Amazon believes can be completed within the time frame. But if your block takes more time, the company doesn’t pay you more.
 Driver experiences are all over the map. Some drivers love the opportunity and say they earn solid returns, even after expenses. Others complain about getting delivery blocks that take far too long for the compensation provided.

The more the medical establishment learns about the virus and its unpredictability, the more my personal concerns have grown. I have an underlying health issue that predisposes me to blood clots; though primarily considered a respiratory disease, COVID-19 is _producing alarming blood clots_ in some patients, sometimes leading to strokes. One of my few quarantine intimates has a father facing a serious illness; me being as careful as possible keeps him and his family safer.
 Colleagues had already begun reporting on dining experiences in places where restaurants had reopened earlier this month. Times culture reporter Daniel Hernandez has a beautiful story in the Food section this weekend about his recent experiences in Bakersfield, including restaurants where he ate solo meals. Thinking through a late lunch of chile verde and tacos at Los Tacos de Huicho, he writes, “After weeks of diligently doing my part to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, I was yearning for a sit-down meal, of any sort, involving strangers. I’m a human being in mourning for our planet. I need comfort. And there are few things more comforting than the good service of the tavern, the inn, the restaurant, the kitchen, where you pay for food instead of gather and cook it for yourself.” I know his ache.
 Los Angeles County, with its 10.1 million residents, remains the center of the pandemic in California. Yet restaurants need customers to survive; restaurant workers need their jobs back. The industry needs government aid that responds to the evolving situation. Plenty of us may feel more comfortable eating outside in the late-spring weather; yesterday Mayor Eric Garcetti announced a program called L.A. Al Fresco aimed at easing zoning regulations for outdoor dining (already in the works in communities such as Long Beach and San Pedro).

President Trump on Saturday taunted demonstrators who gathered around the White House on Friday night to protest his response to the killing of an unarmed black man by a police officer in Minneapolis, and appeared to encourage his own supporters to gather tonight at the executive mansion.
 In a series of tweets criticized for escalating tensions and potentially sparking violence, Trump dismissed the protesters as “professionally managed” and praised the U.S. Secret Service’s response, saying agents and officers handled the situation with restraint.
 When protesters “got too frisky or out of line, [agents] would quickly come down on them, hard - didn’t know what hit them. The front line was replaced with fresh agents, like magic. Big crowd, professionally organized, but nobody came close to breaching the fence.”

Newsom laid out the proposal in January, in his first budget proposal for fiscal 2020-21. Nevertheless, some lawmakers are complaining that they need more time to vet the expansion. A group of 26 Assembly members have asked that the plan be deferred for a year so that hearings could be held. None of them, though, are on the committee that oversees financial services, whose chair, Monique Limón (D-Santa Barbara), is a leading proponent of the plan.
 The request feels more like a stalling tactic than a legitimate effort to improve on the idea. And with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau effectively sidelined, a year’s delay is simply too long. When the economy is tanking and a financial crisis is taking hold, Alvarez said, some lenders, credit-repair companies and other financial services companies go into overdrive “to try to capitalize on the last few dollars in a consumer’s pocket.” The state should work just as aggressively to keep those dollars from being siphoned away.

Trump said he had “watched every move” from inside the executive mansion and “couldn't have felt more safe” as the Secret Service let the protesters carry on, “but whenever someone ... got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on then, hard — didn't know what hit them.” The president also directed social media criticism at the mayors of Washington and Minneapolis.
 The Secret Service said in a statement Saturday that six protesters were arrested and “multiple” officers were injured. There were no details on the charges or nature of the injuries.

COVID-19 has put a damper on almost everything. Several concert tours have either been canceled or postponed. Even new music and album releases have been hampered.      By this point most years, I'm putting together a column predicting what the songs of summer will be. I don't see the point of doing that now. Nothing "feels" like summer, nor does there seem to be a surge from the music industry to push songs.      I understand it, but that doesn't mean I have to be happy about it. I can say this, though: If you're a true artist, you're finding ways to weather this current situation.      I'm loving all the internet videos from artists on YouTube, Facebook Live and other outlets. It is a way for them to keep in touch and entertain the masses. It doesn't compare to a live show, but it's music.      Several artists have canceled tours, including the much-hyped pairing of Bon Jovi and Bryan Adams. Elton John scrapped his "Farewell" tour for another year and I recently learned Janet Jackson's "Black Diamond" tour has been postponed. I was looking forward to seeing her perform again.      Taylor Swift also canceled her tour. This was a big deal, considering the tour was to support her latest hit album, "Lover," her first LP since her highly publicized departure from Big Machine Records. Swift left the label so she could have more say and rights to her own music. Matters turned even uglier when it was later made known that Swift's nemesis, Scooter Braun, had purchased her catalog when he joined her former label. Braun owns the rights to the music from Swift's first six albums.      Swift's canceled tour is a major bummer for her and her fans. But that hasn't stopped the singer. First, she performed on the televised "One World" concert for COVID-19 relief for front-line workers. Then, ABC gave her a prime spot following the "American Idol" season finale, airing a special one-hour performance, taped last fall in Paris, of Swift performing music from "Lover."      Last weekend, Swift may have done what her diehard fans wanted her to do the most. She tweeted her love for the cover of her song "Look What You Made Me Do" heard in an episode of "Killing Eve." The song was credited to a fictional band called Jack Leopards & The Dolphin Club. Boom!      This was a huge move. At one time, Swift's brother Austin went by The Dolphin Club on social media. The song was produced by Nils Sjoberg, which was a pseudonym Swift used on a track she produced with Calvin Harris. The last part of this plan was Swift asked "Killing Eve" executive producers to have her brother featured on the show's soundtrack.      If you haven't heard the track, check it out. It's stellar and has a different feel to it than it did before. If this is, indeed, Austin, then the world had better make room for another Swift.   Sorry, Scooter - Look what you made Taylor Swift do.   David T. Farr can be reached at farrboy@hotmail.com.

Afghanistan's truce ended Tuesday night but violence since then has stayed relatively low, though government security forces have suffered some attacks that authorities blamed on the Taliban.
 The ceasefire and general drop in violence has injected hope into Afghanistan's peace process, which had earlier this month looked to be on the verge of collapse because of soaring Taliban violence after they signed a deal with the US in February.
 Peace talks were initially scheduled to begin on March 10.
 Momentum has also built thanks to the government's release of hundreds of Taliban prisoners in recent weeks, as part of a swap that has also seen the militants free government security force captives.
 Late Saturday, Afghanistan's National Security Council spokesman Javid Faisal said the government had freed another 710 Talban prisoners since Friday in an ongoing process that would fulfil its promise to release 2,000 insurgents in response to the Taliban ceasefire.
 US President Donald Trump's administration has made it a priority to end America's longest war and withdraw all troops by next May. US officials have pushed the Taliban and government leaders to hold peace talks.
 Abdullah was appointed to lead the process after he ended his bitter political feud with President Ashraf Ghani earlier this month.
 He had announced himself as a rival president after rejecting the result of the September election, which incumbent Ghani eventually won amid fraud claims.
 With the end of the dispute, the Afghan government appeared unified in terms of the peace process, a member of Abdullah's negotiating team said.
 "Now we all are united, all on the same page on the question of peace," Matin Bek, a senior government official, told AFP.
