Daily. I had a daily Holy Hour and I’d sit back, and I’d sit in front of the Lord and sometimes just ask him, “What? What are we going to do today?” Recently, I looked back in my journal and realized that I asked the Lord some strange questions back then like, “How are we going to figure out Holy Week.” You do realize that your first inclination should really be to trust in the Lord and his plan because he works it out. It doesn’t take away from the fact that it’s challenging and I’m sure we made many errors, but it was a call to be faithful and trust that he’s going to always get us through it.

An experimental pilot program in Richmond will give $500 a month to 18 families over the next two years, Mayor Levar Stoney announced Thursday.
 The guaranteed basic income is expected to help randomly selected families that no longer qualify for public benefits programs but are still struggling to make ends meet in essential or service industry jobs making only slightly more than $13 an hour.
 Though the cash will help a few families struggling economically during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Richmond Resilience Initiative is based on an idea supported by a coalition of 25 mayors who believe regular direct payments to low-income families can help alleviate wealth inequality for future generations.

The Biden plan builds on the ACA by adding a public option to lower costs and enhance coverage. The plan is gradual and projected as being less costly in terms of possible tax increases. The big deal of the plan is that it offers choice to all to purchase a public health insurance option like Medicare. Biden’s plan would negotiate lower prices from hospitals and health care providers, unleashing the same bargaining power as Medicare on behalf of the public. This plan is an “enhanced lifting all boats” strategy, the hope being that it will reduce existing disparities and move our health care system toward more universal access and greater equity for all.

What if Hayward desires an opportunity for more playing time? He’s not starting over Brown or Tatum. Hayward might want a play elsewhere on a one- year deal to restore his value. He certainly had his moments last season where he was looking more like his Utah self. Initial reports suggest that Hayward is leaning towards exercising his option to remain with the Boston Celtics.
 If both decide to stick around, I’d welcome them back with open arms. But if they leave, the Boston Celtics have significant voids to fill with limited options at their disposal. Just because the Celtics would save almost $40 million, they can’t spend the same money in free agency because they are over the salary cap.
 Semi Ojeleye is young; he has been with the team for three years; he knows the system, and does his job well. That kind of peace of mind is valuable to head coach Brad Stevens and well worth the $1.75 million Semi Ojeleye would get if the Celtics extend his contract.

The Boston Celtics’ biggest need to get to the next level is guts.
 Their loss in the Eastern Conference Finals was disappointing because the Celtics were considered to be a better team than the Miami Heat. However, the Boston Celtics weren't the tougher team. They weren’t willing to do everything it took to win. And when facing crunch time, while the Heat got tough, the Boston Celtics didn’t fight back.
 The Boston Celtics blew big second-half leads in the first two games, which put them in a 0-2 hole that they couldn’t dig out of. Miami almost exclusively defended the Celtics with a zone, and the Celtics weren’t willing to take their offense into the paint or to the rim.
 Repeatedly Marcus Smart, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and company launched ill- advised 3s one after the other. When the Celtics needed a bucket late, Tatum settled for a deep three. That’s the best Tatum could come up with?
 Are the Boston Celtics the victims of their own success? Has making the Eastern Conference Finals three times over the last four seasons gone to their heads?
 Maybe the Celtics were lulled into thinking that their talent was all they needed to beat their opponents. Well, coming up short of the NBA Finals is the bitter pill they need to swallow to build up the desire required to get to the next level.
 Instead of Tatum taking a three, maybe he refines his fade-away turnaround jumper in the post to the point that it’s almost automatic?
 Boston fans love it when Brown is very critical of himself in post-game comments. They know that he'll come hard in the next game. But what if Brown came _that_ hard _every_ game?
 Debating whether to trade one of their best players is nonsense. Tatum and Brown are 22 and 23 respectively. Keep them with Kemba Walker and Gordon Hayward (if he doesn’t opt out). Yes the Boston Celtics need better play from the center position, but finding exactly what they need is easier said than done.
 What president of basketball operations Danny Ainge can do to get the team closer is to improve the team depth. How he does it will be interesting because Boston Celtics are above the cap with four draft selections a young team doesn’t need.

 Williamsburg is to work on the creation of an African American heritage trail in the city, an attraction that would complement longstanding plans for a Martin Luther King Jr. memorial.
 City Council members discussed the trail during a two-day retreat on Thursday as they worked out a set of goals, initiatives and outcomes for 2020-21. Council members also worked on a vision for Williamsburg in 2040. Many of the aims sought to improve downtown vibrancy.

Santana recalled the first time they were contacted by IMPACT through Jeremy Borash. The two had been a tag team on the indies for nearly a decade, and after that call, Santana admitted that he hugged his daughter with the thought that their big break was coming.
 "We get that call, and I remember getting off the phone with Borash and I just hugged my daughter as tight as I could, because I was like, 'this could be it. This could be something,' and I don't have to worry, s--t, next week, if we got enough to do groceries," Santana said. "Then maybe like 30 minutes later, I got a call from a 619 area code. Konnan called me. That was the first time I ever spoke with him."
 Ortiz explained how Konnan came into contact with them through current _NXT_ star, Swerve. He said Swerve had brought up their names when Konnan wanted to bring in new talent for another version of LAX.
 "The story goes, Jeff [Jarrett] had hit up Konan and was like, 'hey, I want you to come back.' They wanted him to come back and be a mouthpiece for someone, and he was like, 'nah, if I'm going to come back, I want to bring back LAX, and I want Homicide with me. But I need two new cats.'" Ortiz recalled. "Konnan, he's always trying to find new talent.
 "Through word of mouth, Shane Strickland - Swerve in _NXT_ , at the moment he was working with Konnan in Lucha Underground, and he just threw our name to him. And he was like, 'hey, I know two Puerto Ricans there. They're a tag team. You want two Latinos? Here you go,' and he did some research on us. He looked up some matches on YouTube."
 Jericho asked what their time in IMPACT was like. Ortiz admitted that it was hectic due to the changing of leadership from Dixie Carter to Jeff Jarrett. He also revealed that when they first won the tag team titles, they found out about it at the last minute.
 "It was hectic. There was a lot going on," Ortiz remarked. "There was a changing of the guard. So Jarrett was taking it back over from Dixie [Carter], so there was a lot going on. Then there was a new regime coming in. The guys that were there from Dixie, they were kind of on their way out. They were bringing in new people to kind of run stuff.
 "So there was just a million things going on, and they got it together, especially towards the end when we left. They got a smaller crew. They had less cooks in the kitchen and a lot more things got done, but during that time, it was chaos honestly. We had no idea what was going on. The day that they put the tag title on us was our second day in the company. We had no contract signed, no nothing.
 "We didn't even know we were winning the titles. Scott D'Amore was the agent of the match. So, we walk up, we're talking about the match, and we're just like, 'yeah, we're calling it.' Alright, cool, and then he's like, 'yeah, LAX is up and it's for the titles.' And then we just look at each other, and we're just like, 'okay, alright.' We play it cool, whatever. The meeting breaks. We walk off to the corner, and we're like, 'what the f--k is going on?'"
 Santana discussed the time when their contracts were expiring and they had to think about whether they wanted to re-sign with the company or move elsewhere. He noted that they had accomplished all they could in IMPACT, and they felt they had to go somewhere else in order to achieve their goals to be the best tag team they can be.
 "Up to that point, we had eight months left in our contract and we started talking. At that point, we were already four-time tag champs there. We did every major match that they had, we had worked all the guys there, and we've always told each other that the only way to get better is to continue working with good people, and to just continue gaining new experiences, and stuff like that.
 "The first thing we said was, 'what else is left for us to do? What can we do?' Because, again, we're always chasing that 'what's next?' We're always wanting to grow and wanting to get better. So we're like, 'what left for us to do here? What are we going to do? How are we going to be different now?' And also at that point, we felt like the crowd was almost turning on us too because we've been in this top position since we came in.
 "We've done everything that the company has put us in, and we were like, 'what else are we going to do?' We got to continue growing. The biggest thing was we want is to give our families a great life."
