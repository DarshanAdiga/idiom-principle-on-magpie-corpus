All campuses are facing this, so there's a huge budget deficit and it's not the kind of thing where you can just tread water on, we have to figure out how to get some more revenue back in order to keep the lights on and keep sending out the paychecks."

Alla partenza presente l'assessore Angelo Sciapichetti per un saluto e un ringraziamento a nome della Regione Marche. Medici e infermieri erano arrivati il 21 aprile e sono stati suddivisi in cinque gruppi che si sono recati nelle strutture sanitarie e nelle residenze per anziani per assistere malati e popolazione anziana.

Politics is all about debating the issues of the day. It is argumentative and divisive by nature. It's about convincing your audience that your answer is the right answer or that your way of thinking is the right way of thinking.
 Governance is about leadership and the actual operating systems that deliver services to citizens. It's making the tough and not always popular decisions. It is trusting the experts in the room, and making decisions in black and white terms that take into account only the safety and security of residents. It is rising to the occasion and simply doing what you were elected to do, even if it results in sharp and sometimes harsh criticism.
 Since the first presumptive positive case of COVID-19 was reported in Massachusetts in early March, over 72,000 residents have been diagnosed with the virus, and more than 4,400 have died. In Plymouth County alone it has claimed more than 350 lives.
 In these unprecedented times, when the current issue we are facing is a public health crisis, there is no room for politics, there is just governance. While it is sometimes difficult to tease apart the difference between those two concepts, it's important for us to make the distinction.
 Throughout this public health crisis, Kingston's elected officials and employees have had to make and support incredibly difficult and not always popular decisions, but in times like these it's not about popularity or "winning", it's about public health.
 To those who today say "It's just politics," I assure you, it's just good governance.
 Joshua Warren, Chairman Kingston Board of Selectman
