White is one of four Rise Above Movement members or associates who pleaded guilty to charges that they punched, kicked, choked and head-butted counterprotesters at the August 2017 rally. White‚Äôs three co-defendants already have been sentenced to between two and three years in prison.
 The violence in Charlottesville culminated with an avowed neo-Nazi, James Fields, deliberately plowing his car into a crowd, killing counterprotester Heather Heyer.
 White acknowledged that he also joined members of the now-defunct Rise Above Movement at an April 2017 political rally on the streets of downtown Berkeley, California, where he punched protesters in the head.
 White pleaded guilty in November 2018 to a riot conspiracy charge punishable by a maximum of five years in prison. He has asked U.S. District Judge Norman Moon to spare him from any more time behind bars.
 San Francisco State had an enrollment of 28,880 students for the fall 2019 semester. White, a California native, has a 3.3 grade point average at San Francisco State and made the school‚Äôs Dean‚Äôs List for the fall 2019 and spring 2020 semesters, according to defense attorney Michael Hemenway.
 White also has worked for his father‚Äôs sprinkler repair company in Clayton, California, since his release from custody. White's attorney said the San Francisco area resident has fully complied with terms of his release, including home electronic monitoring, while waiting to be sentenced.

Malaysia will restrict movements in its biggest city, Kuala Lumpur, neighboring Selangor state and the administrative capital of Putrajaya starting Wednesday to curb a sharp rise in coronavirus cases. Defense Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob says all schools in these areas will be shut and all religious, sports and social activities will be halted for two weeks. He says economic activities can continue but with strict health measures. The move comes just over four months after Malaysia lifted a three-month nationwide lockdown to control the pandemic. It has experienced a new wave of cases following increased travel for an election last month in eastern Sabah state, a hotspot on Borneo island. Several politicians, including a Cabinet minister, tested positive for the virus after returning from Sabah. Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin had to isolate himself for two weeks after coming into contact with the minister. The government earlier announced that Sabah will be placed under a restricted movement order from Tuesday. Ismail said inter- district travel is banned under the partial lockdown, except with approval. Other restrictions include a limit of two people leaving each household to purchase groceries. Malaysia has reported more than 16,000 cases with 157 deaths.

A special court for cases under the Tamil Nadu Protection of Interest of Depositors Act (TNPID) on Monday granted conditional bail to Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL) promoters, Kapil Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan, who were arrested by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the CB-CID in connection with cheating a firm to the tune of ‚Çπ200 crore.
 The EOW booked the case based on the complaint of 63 Moons Technologies, Anna Salai. The power agent of the firm, John Deepak, had approached the Madras High Court seeking its direction to register a case. The court had asked the EOW to consider the complaint and take appropriate action in August.
 The case stated that 63 Moons Technologies Group had invested ‚Çπ200 crore in non-convertible debentures from DHFL, represented by the Wadhawan brothers, on an assurance made by them that they would give a high rate of interest at 9.05% to 9.25% per annum.
 The police said the firm offered the dividend for the period 2016-2017 and then failed to pay, which piled up to ‚Çπ18 crore.
 A first information report was filed against 11 accused, including the Wadhawan brothers. The brothers were arrested by the Enforcement Directorate on September 26 and lodged in Taloja jail, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra.
 The EOW police team produced the two before a magistrate court in Mumbai, and brought them to Chennai last Wednesday after obtaining a transit warrant. They were lodged in the Central Prison, Puzhal.
 Their bail petitions were taken up for hearing. Advocates S. Elambharathi and Abdul Saleem, representing the accused, submitted that the FIR registered against the accused for offences under the TNPID Act was not maintainable as there were no depositors at all as required under the Act.
 Allowing the bail applications, special judge S. Sathish Kumar granted the bail and directed the accused to deposit ‚Çπ50 lakh each as a condition with two sureties.
 ## Conditions imposed
 ‚ÄúOn being released, the petitioners should report before the Deputy Superintendent of Police EOW, Chennai, daily at 10.00 a.m. until further orders. They should cooperate with the pending Investigation and should not threaten, influence or hinder witnesses. If there is any violation of the above conditions, the investigation officer is within his powers to move this court for cancellation of bail,‚Äù the court order said.

Miller said they‚Äôve had several conversations about the upcoming election. But most importantly, they‚Äôve highlighted why it is so important to vote.

In Pennsylvania, 10 of the 33 Part D plans available for 2021 will offer the insulin copay cap, as will nine of the 30 Part D plans sold in New Jersey. If you are interested in this benefit, it is important to check whether it will be part of your 2021 plan, Cubanski said.
 The change could be a money-saver for people who use insulin to treat Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. Insulin costs for seniors who do not receive federal subsidies to help with medication expenses shot up 79% between 2007 and 2017, to $580 a year. Paying $35 a month could reduce annual spending to about $420, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation
 But it‚Äôs important to consider the total cost of a drug plan before making changes, Cubanski said. Plans allowed to participate in the insulin copay program are ‚Äúenhanced‚Äù plans, which offer more generous benefits, but also typically have more costly monthly premiums. If you take other medications, check that they are also covered by the plan. If they‚Äôre not, the amount saved on insulin could easily be consumed by other drug expenses.
 Sarah Murdoch, a client services director for the Medicare Rights Center, said the New York-based consumer advocacy group is getting more calls about Medicare‚Äôs financial assistance programs during the pandemic.

Constitutional law may be similarly unlikely to provide the necessary safeguards on exercises of the executive power. Over the summer and early fall, the terrain has gotten even worse. The Supreme Court has limited due process protections to which immigrants are entitled, recently reversing the Ninth Circuit‚Äôs decision in _Department of Homeland Security v. Thuraissigiam_ and severely limiting _habeas corpus_ review. Indeed, with this decision, the Court once again relied on the racist line of cases, including _Nishimura Ekiu v. United States_, that Cox and Rodr√≠guez argue should be viewed as minimized in importance. Indeed, Cox himself (with Ahilan Arulanantham) has written in Just Security that _Thuraissigiam_ presents an alarming precedent, one which notably expands executive discretion in _habeas_ cases and beyond. Indeed, recently in _Pham v. Ragbir_ _,_ the Court, in light of _Thuraissigiam_ , vacated the Second Circuit‚Äôs decision upholding the Plaintiff‚Äôs challenge to his detention on First Amendment retaliation grounds, signaling that Cox and Arulanantham‚Äôs fears may be well founded. Gerald Neuman has gone further, noting that the threat to due process presented by this case demonstrates not only the insufficiency of safeguards to immigrants‚Äô rights, but the risks of the broad exercise of executive discretion to understandings of due process writ large.

According to myth, both sisters perish and the latter prays to evil spirits to transform from a harsh-smelling flower (both sisters turned into flowers after death) into a pleasant one. The cruel woman‚Äôs prayer fails, turning her into the demon Xtabay who leads men to get lost in the jungles, where she has sex with and then destroys them.

MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) ‚Äî Tommy Tuberville‚Äôs quest for a seat in the U.S. Senate is powered by the reputation he gained as Auburn University‚Äôs football coach, where he led the team to an undefeated season.
 But in the years since, the Republican has been mired in business failings, a lawsuit and even a questionable charity that raises money but gives very little away.
 A hedge fund Tuberville helped start in 2009 was the subject of a criminal investigation in which Tuberville‚Äôs business partner pleaded guilty to fraud. Tuberville, who denied wrongdoing, later settled a lawsuit filed by investors who lost millions.
 In 2014, Tuberville started the Tommy Tuberville Foundation, which has given only a small portion of its money to charity while spending tens of thousands of dollars to stage annual golf tournaments.
 Those financial dealings are now in the spotlight in the closely watched Senate race as Republicans push to recapture the once reliably red state of Alabama. Tuberville, a Trump-backed political newcomer, won the GOP primary by besting former longtime Sen. Jeff Sessions, who failed to reclaim the seat he'd left to become Trump‚Äôs attorney general.
 Zac McCrary, a Democratic pollster, said Tuberville's financial dealings are important for voters to consider.

Wyoming has taken a legislative approach to push back against plans to close coal-fired power units in the state, including a 2019 law forcing utilities that want to retire coal units ahead of schedule to first offer them for sale. They also want to push utilities with coal-fired power in Wyoming to strap on carbon capture technologies ‚Äî an endeavor that‚Äôs been tried elsewhere without success.
 But Gordon and Wyoming lawmakers insist it can work in Wyoming.
 This year, the Wyoming Legislature passed a bill to subsidize carbon capture projects in Wyoming by dipping into Wyoming ratepayers‚Äô pockets. Last month, Gordon rolled out a Wyoming-commissioned U.S. Department of Energy study examining the economic benefits of applying carbon capture to PacifiCorp‚Äôs Wyoming coal units set for early retirement. It concluded that doing so would not only save money for ratepayers, but sustain thousands of jobs and significant tax revenue to the state.
 PacifiCorp, and several energy market experts, panned the study as a woefully inadequate examination.
 ‚ÄúThe list of items missed by the study‚Äôs analysis is very long,‚Äù PacifiCorp spokesman Spencer Hall said in September. ‚ÄúThis type of calculation ignores so many elements, and should not be relied upon for making the kinds of decisions required of a regulated utility.‚Äù
 Hall told WyoFile on Thursday that PacifiCorp needs more time to process the PSC‚Äôs conclusions before commenting.
 Another criticism leveled at the utility‚Äôs analysis was its inclusion of a possible carbon tax or cost applied to the emission of greenhouse gases. Curbing fossil fuel emissions ‚Äî of which coal is a significant contributor ‚Äî will be key to stemming the climate crisis, according to scientists.
 PSC Chairwoman Fornstrom agreed with other intervening parties‚Äô testimony that the inclusion of a potential future price on carbon might have skewed PacifiCorp‚Äôs analysis of shifting from coal to renewables. A proper analysis of future energy markets in the utility‚Äôs service territory might better be rooted in existing laws and regulations, she said. So far, there isn‚Äôt a regulated price on carbon emissions.
 PSC Deputy Chair Mary Throne disagreed. ‚ÄúI recognize that there is no carbon tax in place yet, but I don‚Äôt believe there was any testimony that it‚Äôs completely unreasonable to include some risk for carbon regulation in the future ‚Äî and indeed the Clean Air Act still regulates greenhouse gases. That has not gone away, and is unlikely to go away,‚Äù she said.
 Throne said Wyoming‚Äôs wishes are complicated by the fact that PacifiCorp must meet regulatory requirements in several other states. Trying to quantify the potential future cost of meeting evolving regulations limiting fossil fuel emissions is ‚Äúdifficult and speculative,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it is improper for PacifiCorp to consider the cost of carbon [emissions] going forward.‚Äù
 This week, the Trump administration is arguing in the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington D.C. that the federal government doesn‚Äôt have authority to limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.
 Shannon Anderson is staff attorney for the Powder River Basin Resource Council, a Sheridan-based landowner advocacy group that intervened in the PSC‚Äôs investigation. She said she was glad to hear that the PSC doesn‚Äôt seem to see its role and authority expanding into consideration of the more broad and complex aspects of socioeconomic impacts related to closing power generating facilities and building new facilities. However, she said, she still worries that the PSC might move in that direction.
 ‚ÄúThey [the PSC and elected leaders] want to save these coal plants,‚Äù Anderson said after Thursday‚Äôs hearing. ‚ÄúThe question is how, and is it legal?‚Äù
 The PRBRC saw no evidence in the PSC investigation filings that PacifiCorp‚Äôs plans to begin shuttering old coal plants and replacing them with renewable energy and battery storage will result in increased costs to ratepayers and reliability issues, she said. Although, Anderson added, her organization would like to see deeper analysis of both questions.
 ‚ÄúThis [PacifiCorp‚Äôs 2019 IRP] is a very modest proposal and recognizes the coal units they propose to retire are completely uneconomic,‚Äù Anderson said. ‚ÄúEvery day they run, they lose money for customers.‚Äù

Lloyd Kerry scored a 73rd-minute winner as League Two new boys Harrogate Town gained a 1-0 win at Yorkshire rivals Bradford
 In the first league meeting between the clubs, Bradford suffered their first home league defeat for almost a year.
 Harrogate‚Äôs aggressive, high-energy approach caused Bradford problems in a the first half and the Bantams had to thank their skipper, keeper Richard O‚ÄôDonnell, for three fine saves to keep out the lively visitors.
 He did well to turn a 20-yard shot from George Thomson over the bar in the fifth minute and was forced to dive full length to parry a rasping 20-yard shot from Kerry in the 22nd minute.
 O‚ÄôDonnell was injured in trying to re-gather the ball as former Bradford striker Jon Stead swooped on the rebound and had to receive treatment before play resumed.
 His best save, though, came in the 34thmiute when he dived to turn Stead‚Äôs goalbound header round the post.
 Bradford were less threating but Billy Clarke and Clayton Donaldson both tested James Belshaw in the visitors‚Äô goal with long-range efforts.

 This county, Kent, voted by 60%-40% to leave the EU in Britain's 2016 referendum, but Swandale said visions of truck stops and customs depots were not uppermost in their minds.
 "That was never part of the actual selling and the marketing for Brexit," she said.
 The two prosperous villages of Sevington and Mersham are 15 miles (24 kilometers) from the Channel Tunnel to France and 20 miles (32 kilometers) from Britain's biggest ferry port at Dover. Between them, the two routes carry 4 million trucks a year, filled with food and all manner of other essential items.
 Those goods moved back and forth freely while Britain was part of the EU's single market and customs union. The U.K. left the bloc's political structures in January, and will make an economic break when a transition period ends Dec. 31. That means Britain must erect a customs border with the 27-nation EU, its biggest trading partner.
 Opponents of Brexit say it is a waste of money and effort that will hurt businesses on both sides. For supporters, it's all part of taking back control of the country's borders and trade.
 But everyone agrees it means new red tape, with the need for customs declarations and inspections. If the U.K. and the EU fail to strike a free trade deal before the end of the year, tariffs will be slapped on many goods, bringing more disruption, bureaucracy and expense.
 Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative government has been reluctant to disclose details of its border plans. But last month it admitted its "reasonable worst-case scenario" involved "7,000 port-bound trucks in Kent and associated maximum delays of up to two days."
 The government's plans for limiting the disruption include converting parts of a highway into a temporary parking lot for trucks, and imposing a "Kent access pass" ‚Äî essentially a passport that truckers heading for the EU must have to enter Kent from other parts of Britain.
 The Sevington site is intended for customs checks, and could also be a "temporary traffic management facility" ‚Äî a parking lot ‚Äî for trucks if there are border delays, the government says.

‚ÄúI feel like for us as a team, as players we‚Äôre taking the proper and necessary precautions to maintain our safety. But at the end of the day this is a very unknown thing when it comes to just how the virus is spreading and things like that,‚Äù wide receiver Allen Robinson said. ‚ÄúAll you can do is hope that nobody else is in the crossfire.‚Äù


  Concern about linemen who might develop the virus because they were around Trarore seems to be small, according to right guard Germain Ifedi.


  ‚ÄúThe crazy thing about this virus is it works in weird ways,‚Äù Ifedi said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had people close to me who have had it and I was around it for a long period of time and didn‚Äôt get it. So I don‚Äôt worry about that.


  ‚ÄúI just hope he‚Äôs OK and not showing symptoms, and am just glad that we‚Äôre getting tested every day. It just heightens your sense of we‚Äôve got to wear a mask.‚Äù


  The offensive line will have a different left guard starter when the Bears play at Carolina on Sunday, most likely Alex Bars for Daniels. The second-year player from Notre Dame replaced Daniels after the injury against the Buccaneers and played almost all of the second half without many bad mistakes.


  ‚ÄúHe had one or two in there,‚Äù Nagy said. ‚ÄúThere was one (sack) in there that they got; that‚Äôs a part of this game. But I have a lot of confidence in him.‚Äù

The 27-acre field is one of 10 sites around the country earmarked for potential border infrastructure, under powers the government has given itself to buy and build without consulting local authorities or residents first.
 "Up to now no local resident has seen the plans," said Rick Martin, chairman of Sevington parish council, adding that locals are worried about gridlock and the effect the site will have on property prices.
 "People are quite perplexed at the moment about what it's going to look like when there's 1,000 lorries parked across the road," he said.
 Sevington and Mersham are ancient settlements, mentioned in the 1086 census known as the Domesday Book, but the residents can't be said to reject modern life. They already live with the hum of traffic on the M20 highway that cuts through the area, and the sound of trains whooshing at 185 mph (300 kph) toward the Channel Tunnel.
 That makes them even more determined to preserve the remaining rural character of their communities.
 With the support of local politicians, villagers are trying to limit the damage by saving an adjoining field, also bought by the government but not yet slated for development. It's the last green space between them and the sprawling town of Ashford nearby.
 "It would be the perfect place to save as a green buffer between all the development here and the village," said Swandale, a member of the Village Alliance, a local campaigning group.
 Construction has already chased off the skylarks that used to inhabit the future customs site. Swandale says preserving the other field could save great crested newts and dormice and the paths used by walkers, cyclists and horse riders.
 "It's taking back control," she said, echoing the Brexiteer slogan. "It's having this for the local people, it's using it. It's planting trees to reduce carbon, it's increasing its biodiversity. ‚Ä¶ It would go a long way to mitigate this development."
 Britons still don't know whether New Year's Day 2021 will bring the government's worst-case scenario or a smoother exit. Talks on a U.K.-EU trade deal are deadlocked over fishing rights and fair-competition rules. At a summit this week, EU leaders will assess whether a breakthrough is possible. There are only weeks left to seal a deal if it is to be ratified by year's end.
 Paul Bartlett, a Conservative member of Kent County Council who lives right beside the huge construction site, acknowledges the customs facility on his doorstep came as a surprise. But as a staunch supporter of Brexit, he is determined to see the positive side of the new customs site.
 "We need jobs," he said, after the coronavirus pandemic plunged the U.K. into recession. "I hope we'll have 300 jobs and there's a good system of apprenticeships that young people can sign up to and develop a career for themselves.
 "It's a beautiful part of the country to live in, and sometimes you've got to take the rough with the smooth."

  Miller shared her plan with members of Sun Devil Athletics‚Äô administration, who helped set it in motion shortly before the pandemic forced classes online and canceled all sports, including her softball season.


  After the death of George Floyd in Minnesota, Miller put her initiative into high gear with the help of Sun Devil Athletics, the Andrew Goodman Foundation and the university as a whole.


  In late September, Miller took additional steps in an effort to have all athletes registered.


  ‚ÄúAll of 2020 in all of its glory pushed me to make me realize something needs to change,‚Äù Miller said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think voting is the only solution by any means, but at the end of the day, we have to start somewhere.


  ‚ÄúIf there is one thing from this crazy year you want to change,‚Äù she added, ‚ÄúI guarantee there is a position you can vote for.‚Äù


  Miller said her family always stressed the importance of voting in every election. At a young age, she believed it was something all U.S. citizens do when they turn 18. But as she got older, she realized voting was a choice many of her peers ignored.


  When Miller turned 17, her grandmother, Kimberly Carr, helped her and a couple of her friends register to vote.


  Miller said Carr has been a poll worker for Maricopa County for several years and has shared her interest in politics with the rest of the family.


  Additionally, Miller‚Äôs aunts are also deeply engulfed in politics. One even quit her job in an effort to work in an election. However, after the pandemic hit, she wasn‚Äôt able to be hired. Instead, she‚Äôs volunteered.

 Cheney said the COVID-19 pandemic has made it much more difficult for young people entering the workforce to find jobs, adding another layer to the housing struggles.
 ‚ÄúPre-COVID, we absolutely saw an expansion in job opportunities, an expansion in employment levels across the board ‚Äì for young people, for women, for minority communities,‚Äù Cheney said. ‚ÄúI think that what we need to do is make sure that we can get back to that.

 With the Mullen Fire continuing to burn in southeast Wyoming, the candidates also briefly touched on how the U.S. can improve its forests, with Cheney criticizing the federal approach to management of the landscapes.
 ‚ÄúThe real cause of the fires that we‚Äôre seeing, the Mullen Fire and the fires that we‚Äôre seeing across the West, is absolutely failed federal forest management policy,‚Äù Cheney said. ‚ÄúWhen you look at the extent that we cannot get in and clear out the beetle kill, you look at the extent that we‚Äôve had mills that have gone out of business because our timber sales just haven‚Äôt been there, those are the things that we‚Äôve got to do to get these forests back healthy.‚Äù
 Grey Bull said there needs to be more federal funding for forest management.
 ‚ÄúLiving here on the western side of our country, we really have to get the supplies and resources needed to our first responders and fire departments and our national forest services,‚Äù Grey Bull said. ‚ÄúI do think the federal policy could do a better job of making sure that our first responders are supplied with what they need.‚Äù
