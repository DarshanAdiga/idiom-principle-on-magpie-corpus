Our first suggestion to pilots who haven’t been flying in a year or so is to start reading. Go to AVweb (www.avweb.com) and search its extensive library for materials on rusty pilots and recurrent training. There are numerous videos on YouTube. The FAA’s Safety Team website (www.faasafety.gov) is a treasure trove of information on getting back up to speed as an active pilot. There’s no need to have a hair trigger to buy stuff—the current FARs and Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) are on the FAA’s website (www.faa.gov).

We looked at a cross section of study materials available and attended one of AOPA’s (www.aopa.org) free-to-AOPA-members Rusty Pilot seminars. We also spoke with CFIs who have flown with rusty pilots to get them back up to speed and through a flight review. Our conclusion is that there are some excellent resources available to a pilot who is willing to do the homework involved with getting back to flying.

A fundraiser started by a town resident to feed workers at South Shore Hospital has already raised thousands of dollars while supporting local restaurants.
 "It's been great to be able to do something positive during these times," said Laura Arsenault.
 Arsenault said she was inspired to raise money to feed healthcare workers after a video chat few weeks ago with some cousins. One of her cousins and her husband are doctors, and told their family about how stressed and worried hospital workers are because of the pandemic. They're working incredible amounts of hours and worry constantly about bringing the virus home to their loved ones, she said.
 There are only so many ways people outside the hospital can bring some relief to their front line workers, Arsenault said. So, she and her family decided to raise money to feed workers at Beverly Hospital on the North Shore, where her cousin's husband practices. Within a few days, they raised about $6,000.
 But, as a Hingham resident and an employee at the Hingham Public Library, Arsenault said she felt compelled to bring that effort a little closer to home. And, she recognized this as an opportunity to support local eateries that may be struggling because of the pandemic.
 On March 31, she launched a GoFundMe specifically to buy and deliver food to employees at South Shore Hospital in Weymouth. Three weeks later, the fundraiser has raised well over $18,000.
 Local restaurants and businesses from across the South Shore have agreed to deliver food, including Euromart in Hingam, The Cracker Barrel and The Green Light in Hingham, Bo Cafe and Little Carmen's in Norwell, Tennessee's BBQ in Braintree, Breadbasket in Hull and The Daily Press juice bar in Cohasset.
 On Easter Sunday, employees from Hingham ice cream shop Nona's Homemade brought 700 pre-scooped bowls of ice cream in their truck to the hospital's parking lot, and spent two hours passing them out to hospital workers.
 Businesses have all jumped at the opportunity to be involved, Arsenault said.
 "Everybody just feels like they want to do something and be connected to the problem in some way," she said. "So I think this gives them an outlet so they can help."
 There are six more food deliveries lined up for this week, Arsenault said. With the donations they have now, they can keep bringing meals for about two more weeks.
 Arsenault said the fundraiser is to feed all employees at the hospital including engineers and custodial staff, not just those in the ICU who are directly treating coronavirus patients. Workers who focus on keeping the building clean and well-maintained are especially crucial during this pandemic, she said.
 "To run a hospital, it's not just the people by your bedside who're making it happen," she said.
