“Nobody can predict to what extent the numbers will go up,” Dr. Khilnani said.
 As many parts of India continue to see days with record-high infections, a political consensus on how to fight the virus has deteriorated, giving way to acrimony and finger-pointing.
 “We are the only country in the world where the virus is exponentially rising,” Rahul Gandhi, a leader of the opposition Indian National Congress party, said in a video statement. “What India is facing now, in front of us, is the result of a failed lockdown.”

 Amit Malviya, a spokesman for Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, fired back in a television interview. He accused Mr. Gandhi of not taking stronger action to contain infections in Maharashtra, India’s hardest-hit state, which is governed by a coalition that includes the Indian National Congress.
 “Maharashtra is completely over the top, it’s bleeding, people are dying, the health infrastructure’s crumbled,” Mr. Malviya said. Health officials have traced nearly 40 percent of India’s cases to the state.
 Questions have also been raised about whether the lockdown played a role in spreading the virus to remote areas of India.
 When Mr. Modi announced the restrictions, he gave Indians just four hours to prepare before they went into effect. Millions of migrant workers were stranded in cities. With bus and train services suspended, some walked hundreds of miles to reach their villages, using dirty pieces of cloth to cover their faces. The human suffering has been staggering.
 Shiv Dutt Gupta, a member of a government task force crafting the lockdown exit plan, partially attributed the surge in new cases to laborers bringing the coronavirus into rural India.
 Test results for several hundred migrant workers who traveled from New Delhi to the state of Bihar this month found that one in four had contracted Covid-19. Bihar now has one of the steepest infection curves in India, and troubling clusters have also been tracked to laborers traveling to their homes in Uttar Pradesh, the country’s most populous state.

 “The rate of positive cases among the migrant workers is very high,” Mr. Gupta said. “That is alarming.”
 But he said the lockdown could not go on forever. Around 122 million Indians lost their jobs in April, according to the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy, a leading business analytics company. Some industries have teetered on the edge of bankruptcy.

Also, the word gaming is becoming more commonly used in place of the word gambling because of the negative connotation connected with gambling. Therefore, if you are confused with terms like online gaming and online casino and internet gaming, don’t feel bad. It is confusing to try and separate them but in reality, they are nearly one and the same. As mentioned above, our law does not differentiate based on actual definition of the words or actions, rather where the principal actor or player is when he/she plays the game. In other words, it is not What kind of game is being played, it is Where the player is playing the game. It seems our law define an act to be gambling if the player is in Palau but if the player is outside of Palau, then it is not gambling. A proof of that is that the law prohibits Palauans in Palau to access the games and in fact, mandate the company to ensure that their systems are closed to anyone trying to access them from Palau.

The EURUSD advanced past the 1.11 on the back of a broadly softer US dollar and hope that the much-needed 750-billion-euro fiscal rescue package could give a boost the Eurozone economy. The latest proposal from the European Commission needs an approval first, but the so-called frugal four will likely come round to the rescue fund though there are uncertainties on how the historical rescue package would be implemented. Technically, the euro recovery could gain pace if the major 61.8% Fibonacci resistance at 1.1160 is cleared and target the 100-week moving average near the 1.1225 mark.

Indonesian officials are forcing social distancing violators to recite Koran verses, stay in "haunted" houses and submit to public shaming on social media as the country battles to contain surging coronavirus infections.
 The Southeast Asian archipelago began deploying around 340,000 troops across two dozen cities to oversee enforcement of measures aimed at halting transmission of the disease, such as wearing facemasks in public.
 But provincial leaders are buttressing these efforts with their own zealous campaigns to fight the virus.
 Police in western Bengkulu province have assembled a 40-person squad to find lockdown scofflaws and force them to wear placards with promises to wear masks and keep their distance from others in future.
 Pictures of the perpetrators are then uploaded to social media for maximum shaming effect, according to an official.
 "People in Bengkulu still aren't aware of the importance of following the rules, especially when it comes to wearing masks and not gathering" in big groups, said Martinah, Bengkulu's public order agency chief, who goes by one name.
 "This is for the sake of themselves and their families," he added.
 Some of those singled out by police have bristled at the punishment, including fisherman Firmansyah, who was punished for failing to abide by the mask rule while alone on his boat.
 "It's silly to wear a mask when I'm out at sea," he said, after he was nabbed returning to shore.
 "There's no regulation to wear a mask in the water. If there was I'd comply with it."
 Farther north in conservative Aceh province, those flouting public health regulations have been forced to atone by reading passages from the Koran.
 The area's tiny non-Muslim minority are spared from the punishment.
 "If we find them not wearing face masks they'll just be reprimanded," said local government spokeswoman Agusliayana Devita.
 Capital city Jakarta announced new rules this month that could see residents who break social distancing rules forced to clean public facilities -- including toilets -- while wearing vests that label them as rule-breakers.
 To the east in Sragen regency, offenders have been jailed in repurposed abandoned houses that local residents believe are haunted -- tapping widespread beliefs in the supernatural, which play a key role in Indonesian folklore.
 Indonesia has confirmed around 24,000 cases of COVID-19 and 1,496 deaths, but the country of more than 260 million has some of the lowest testing rates in the world.
 Researchers estimate the true number of virus fatalities is several times the official toll.
