Rising requirement for improved threat protection on the back of increase in the frequency of cyber security attacks is fueling the growth of the market of managed security service providers. Additionally, it helps an organization to reduce their cost by outsourcing their security needs to managed security service providers, so as to attain economies of scales. Cyber intelligence is the ability to respond rapidly to the real time incidents. This demands understanding the security event log data, filtering of the appropriate threat feeds, insecure data and recommending the right means to handle the data. Most of the companies failed to support such type of functions. To overcome this need, companies need to be partner with skilled security service provider, who will help to avoid risk, providing the skilled staff and supporting the network capabilities to constantly monitor and analyze. Market players that are investing in in-house network infrastructure facilities with the current technology need significant time to bring it in the action. This leads to the outsourcing of security services to professional service providers.

New York State is administering antibody tests today in Tompkins County as part of a statewide survey. https://t.co/NirbvAwTg6
 — Mayor Svante Myrick (@SvanteMyrick) April 28, 2020


  In New York’s Southern Tier region, where Tompkins County is located, the state’s antibody testing suggested a past infection rate of 2.4 percent, according to Cuomo. In New York City and Long Island, the rates were 24.7 percent and 14.4 percent, respectively.


  The high number of sampled individuals with antibodies supports what New York health experts had long believed — that communal transmission in the state likely began as early as mid-February, well before the state’s first officially reported case on March 1.


  But the using antibody tests to determine immunity has been called into question by top health officials at the World Health Organization, who said that “there is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection.”


  However, New York State Health Commissioner Dr. Howard A. Zucker said that New York’s antibody test could reliably determine immunity. Anthony Fauci M.D. ’66 similarly said that previous exposure would limit risk of reinfection, even floating the idea of “immunity cards” for those who have recovered from the coronavirus.


  At Weill Cornell, researchers are attempting to clarify the timeline of coronavirus’ onset in New York by analyzing the remains of roughly 20 individuals who died in February and March to see if COVID-19 may have been the cause of death.


  In Ithaca, testing eligibility for COVID-19 was expanded on Monday to include essential workers, symptomatic individuals and those who have recently interacted with someone who tested positive for the virus.

BANGKOK (AP) — As governments move forward with plans to ease coronavirus restrictions, health officials around the globe are calling on the public to remain vigilant so that hard-won victories in the battle against the pandemic are not lost. With South Koreans about to celebrate their longest holiday since infections there surged in February, authorities on Wednesday urged people to think twice about traveling and to continue to wear masks, not share food and stay home if they are feeling sick. Officials in Japan also asked people not to travel during that country's upcoming Golden Week holiday. “We must not let a moment of carelessness trigger mass transmissions that would make the efforts we invested so far vanish like bubbles of water,” South Korean Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said. South Korea was the first country after China to see an explosion in virus cases, but like many other previous hot spots, it has seen the number of cases drop off. It reported just nine new cases on Wednesday, and hasn't seen a daily jump above 100 since April 1, allowing the government to relax its social distancing guidelines and prepare to reopen schools. When and how to reopen has become a matter of intense debate around the world, perhaps no more so than in the United States. Some states there have started lifting their coronavirus restrictions piecemeal and according to their own, often arbitrary, timetables, leaving Americans to make their own decisions about what they should and should not do to protect their health, their livelihoods and their neighbors. “There will never be a perfect amount of protection,” said Josh Santarpia, a microbiology expert at the University of Nebraska Medical Center who is studying the coronavirus. “It’s a personal risk assessment.

I was one of 26,000 fans who packed into Flower Lodge and watched in horror as Hibs, 2-0 up against Waterford with just 11 minutes to play, conceded three late goals in what was effectively a play-off to retain their title. That defeat handed the league to Alfie Hale’s men. We were all shellshocked.


  Back in September 1971, just two weeks into secondary school, my affinity with Cork Hibs made it a lot easier to make new friends in Christians.


  As reigning League of Ireland champions, Hibs hit the jackpot when drawing West German champions Borussia Monchengladbach in the first round of the European Cup.


  On a bright Wednesday afternoon a number of us skipped sports and headed for Flower Lodge instead.


  Monchengladbach were a huge draw with big names in West German international’s Gunter Netzer, Jupp Heynckes, and Berti Vogts all on board.


  So accustomed with watching Hibs beat all-comers when playing at home, we were shocked at the ease with which they were torn apart, eventually losing 5-0. Netzer was sensational. His range of pin-point passing ripped the home defence to pieces. We had never seen that happen.


  As a centre-half pairing Noel O’Mahony and Fada Sheehan frightened the life out of everyone in the League of Ireland. After a 0-0 draw against Shelbourne at Dalymount Park in the 1973 FAI Cup final, the replay was fixed for midweek down the Lodge. We couldn’t believe our luck. Off we went again.


  I remember an evening spent with Ireland manager Paul McNaughton at the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand. Paul was a very talented sportsman, winning 15 caps in the centre for Ireland. He also played senior championship football with Wicklow and League of Ireland soccer as a semi professional with Bray Wanderers and Shelbourne including that FAI Cup final and replay in 1973.

A MAN is out on bail awaiting his day in court after he was charged and accused of targeting multiple Stanthorpe service stations in two brazen thefts.
 The 42-year-old South Toowoomba man has been hit with several charges according to Stanthorpe Police Senior Sergeant Gerard Brady.
 “Last week there was two instances where a fella has gone into two service stations and asked for cigarette products only to grab them and run out,” Sen Sgt Brady said.
 “The first offence occurred on Thursday, April 23 at 10.30am at Metro Fuel on Maryland St.
 “The male has requested a number of tobacco and food products, they’ve been put in a plastic bag and as they cashier is ringing them up he’s grabbed them and run.”
 The second alleged offence took place two days later at the Caltex Woolworths service station on High St, Stanthorpe.
 This time he’s applied the same modus operandi, but been met with a bit of fight.
 “The counter bloke has chucked bottles of flavoured milk at him.”
 The accused will be crying over spilt milk now though, with police determining his whereabouts and arresting him on April 28.
 He has subsequently been charged with two counts of entering a premises to commit an indictable offence, contravening a direction and in property use of an emergency call service.
 “At the time of the offences the offender has phoned triple-0 as a distraction for police,” Sen Sgt Brady said.
 It’s believed the offender has ties to the Stanthorpe area and is a previous resident.
 He was released with bail conditions and will appear in Toowoomba Magistrates Court on July 27.

It was then put to him that the length of the suspension, added to the fact that it fell in a window in which no rugby would be played, appeared lenient.


  “That is the case,” he replied, “that’s why we’re reviewing it.”


  Sportspeople here have access to a specialised app that allows them to check that over-the-counter medications available are compliant with anti-doping regulations.


  “All that information is out there, Treacy explained. “It is available at your fingertips. Whether you are a professional or an amateur athlete competing in international sport, or you are competing where testing is being carried out, you should be testing the medications that you are on.”


  Rugby was second only to cycling in terms of the number of tests carried out in 2019 and no sport had more TUEs (therapeutic use exemptions) with the code accounting for nine of the 44 accommodated in 2019.


  Treacy pointed out that the volume of tests in sports such as rugby and cycling were in keeping with previous – and best – practise as these were considered “high risk” sports in an international context.


  Various rugby bodies also paid for a combined 150 of 178 tests conducted under the ‘User Pays Programme’ with World Rugby requesting 78, the IRFU 32, EPCR another 24 and the Six Nations the last 16. The next most significant utiliser of this service as the International Hockey Federation with 17.


  The focus on rugby has increased more or less year on year and Dr Una May, Director of Participation and Ethics with Sport Ireland, explained how, contrary to popular perceptions, the body is also testing schoolboy players now.

Dave Bacuzzi was signed as player-manager of Cork Hibernians from Reading in 1970. He had played in the then First Division — today’s Premier League — for Arsenal and Manchester City. The closest we ever got to that was watching Match of the Day.


  BACUZZI looked different. He was tanned. There was an aura of authority about the way he carried himself. When, as captain, he led the Hibs side out of the little dressing room complex at the corner of the pitch, he looked so elegant. He would bounce onto the pitch on the balls of his feet and glide over the top of the grass.


  By way of contrast, fellow defenders Noel O’Mahony, Frank Connolly or Martin “Fada” Sheehan, whose bristling foxy beard made him look even more ferocious to kids of our age, would gobble up the ground and anyone else who stood in their way.


  John Herrick was a classy full-back. His uncle Jack lived next door to us and in my naivety I felt connected to the team as a result. You had the three magicians in Carl Davenport, “the Dav” to all and sundry, Tony Marsden and Dave Wigginton. They were to us what Messi, Suarez and Neymar were to Barcelona. Poetry in motion.


  That was before Miah Dennehy scored a hat-trick against Waterford in the 1972 FAI Cup. Miah was everyone’s favourite after that, so good that Nottingham Forest signed him the following season. Donie Wallace had blinding pace. His ability to take on defender’s always created massive excitement on the grassy banks. Glasgow Celtic had the flying Jimmy Johnstone but we had Donie Wallace.


  I remember a few of us walking down Wellington Road one afternoon, heading back to school after the lunchtime break, when Hibs towering goalkeeper Joe Grady, who was stationed in Collins Barracks with the army, stopped and gave us a spin. We couldn’t wait to get back and tell everyone. Nobody believed us.


  THE fact Bacuzzi always had his side in contention for silverware made life even more exciting.


  Under his stewardship Hibs won the league in 1971 and back-to-back FAI Cup’s in 1972 and 1973.

CHICAGO — Former Chicago Blackhawks president John McDonough, in his first public comments since he was fired, called his time with the team “the ride of a lifetime.”
 McDonough also praised owner Rocky Wirtz and his family in a statement released by the team on Tuesday, one day after he was dismissed.
 “My late father used a phrase sparingly but impactfully to describe those he found to be the most dignified, respectful and worthy of admiration,” McDonough said. “He would say they had ‘class à la mode.’ That perfectly describes the Wirtz family and the Chicago Blackhawks.
 “Good luck. I’ll always be pulling for you.”
 The 66-year-old McDonough provided no clues on the circumstances surrounding his surprise departure. In the team statement announcing the change on Monday, Rocky Wirtz pointed to the coronavirus crisis and the suspension of the NHL season as an opportunity to assess the team’s direction.
 McDonough was president of baseball’s Chicago Cubs before he was hired by Wirtz in 2007.
 “Rocky Wirtz gave me an amazing opportunity to preside over the Chicago Blackhawks 12 ½ years ago,” McDonough said. “It was the ride of a lifetime. I would like to thank Rocky, the Wirtz family, our staff, the players, the ambassadors and the fans for all they have done for the organization. I will be forever grateful to them and proud of what we accomplished together. Blackhawks fans are so incredibly passionate and loyal and are deserving of a consistent winner.”
 McDonough’s arrival was a key moment in the Blackhawks’ climb from one of the worst franchises in sports to the top of the NHL.
 “Thirteen years ago, I recruited John to the Blackhawks because of his leadership, direction and vision. John brought all of that to the table and more,” Rocky Wirtz said in a news release. “His contributions went well beyond leading the team to three Stanley Cup championships. He rebuilt the front office and helped guide the organization toward a winning vision.
 “As difficult as this is, we believe it was the right decision for the future of the organization and its fans.”
 McDonough helped revamp the team’s business operations while star forwards Jonathan Toews and Patrick Kane powered Chicago to the Stanley Cup title in 2010, 2013 and 2015. While the business side of the franchise remains in good shape, the Blackhawks haven’t made the playoffs since 2017.
 McDonough’s departure could lead to massive changes across the organization.
 “While we can reassure you all that there will be hockey again, no one knows what it will look like,” Rocky Wirtz said in the memo. “We must take the opportunity today to reimagine our future and to set a positive course getting there.”
 Danny Wirtz, Rocky’s 43-year-old son and a vice president with the team, is replacing McDonough on an interim basis.
 “I wish Danny Wirtz well in his new role, and I am confident the organization will have success in the search for a new president,” McDonough said in his statement.

NEW YORK (AP) — A coronavirus vaccine is still months or years away, but groups that peddle misinformation about immunizations are already taking aim, potentially eroding confidence in what could be humanity’s best chance to defeat the virus.
 In recent weeks, vaccine opponents have made several unsubstantiated claims, including allegations that vaccine trials will be dangerously rushed or that Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, is blocking cures to enrich vaccine makers. They’ve also falsely claimed that Microsoft founder Bill Gates wants to use a vaccine to inject microchips into people — or to cull 15% of the world’s population.
 Vaccine opponents in the U.S. have been around for a long time. Their claims range from relatively modest safety concerns about specific vaccines or the risk of side effects to conspiracy theories that border on the bizarre.
 The movement is receiving renewed attention, especially as it aligns itself with groups loudly protesting restrictions on daily life aimed at controlling the spread of the virus. Health professionals say vaccine misinformation could have lethal consequences if it leads people to opt for bogus cures instead.
 “Only a coronavirus vaccine can truly protect us from future outbreaks,” said Dr. Scott Ratzan, a physician and medical misinformation expert at the City University of New York and Columbia University. “But what if the effort succeeds and large numbers of people decide not to vaccinate themselves or their children?”
 While vaccines for diseases such as polio, smallpox and measles have benefited millions, some skeptics reject the science, citing a distrust of modern medicine and government. Others say mandatory vaccine requirements violate their religious freedom.

Coffey lists four schools that are the main competitors for his commitment – Texas, LSU, Oregon and Washington. The Longhorns would appear to have an advantage in that their closest to home and while Coffey says distance won’t be a determining factor in his decision, he does admit that it’s crossed his mind more of late.
 “To me, distance doesn’t really play a big factor. But I have had thoughts recently because I’m really close to my family, and I want them to be at my games,” Coffey said. “But to me, distance isn’t a big factor.”
 The Texas Longhorns have been a school that’s always been in the mix for Coffey, who ranks No. 112 on the Rivals250. With a largely new group of assistant coaches on the UT staff, Coffey said his connection with Texas is as strong as ever.
 “I’ve been talking to coach (Chris) Ash a lot. I’ve been talking to coach Valai, been talking to all them a lot recently,” Coffey said. “Then I’ve been getting some out of the blue training sessions in with Coach Flight (of FlightSkillzPerformance) where I’ve seen some UT players. Some new things popped up, but I’d say my relationship with them is definitely better."
 The Texas coaches have stressed to the 6-0, 175-pound Coffey that they like his versatility in the back end of the defense, and Coffey feels he could thrive in the new scheme that Texas will employ under Ash.
 “Coach Ash says he sees me as a normal safety, but also would like to try me in as a nickel back, almost like an outside linebacker but also a nickel back,” Coffey said. “I like the way he sees me playing, like how I would fit in there. My goal is to make it to the league, so as many ways as I can show that I can make plays I think would be a good thing.”
 Coffey is ranked as a four-star prospect who holds about 30 offers overall. He’s the No. 5-ranked safety in the nation by Rivals.com.

I was 10 years old when introduced to the buzz associated with games down the Lodge for the first time.


  A neighbour, Dan Kelly, who lived across the road, was a Cork Hibernians season ticket holder. That entitled him sit on the halfway line in the stand every second Sunday. In those days at every sporting event, including All- Ireland hurling and football finals, you were allowed slip a child into the ground with you when filtering through the turnstiles. It was a common occurrence at most matches for kids to queue up outside the ground and ask a man to “take me in, please sir”.


  I was lucky. Mr Kelly collected me every Sunday and, with a few other neighbours, we would climb into the back of Billy Scouts’s van and head off to the game.


  Mr Kelly had no problem smuggling me into the middle of the stand. The chat surrounding the match in the back of the van, before and after the game, was fascinating. I would just sit there and listen while the atmosphere once inside the ground was electric.


  I think Mr Scouts was a tradesman of some description, hence the van. It was always full of tools. I remember him talking one day about the simplicity of modern day songs. “There’s a new one just out” he mused. “I’d rather be a hammer than a nail”. Given his day job, it clearly resonated with him. It was my first introduction to Simon and Garfunkel. After moving from national school in St. Patrick’s to CBC, I was deemed old enough to go it alone on match days and head for the terraces. Even in a rugby mad school like Christians, if you weren’t at the Cork Hibs game on a Sunday you were out of the conversation on Monday morning.

Bluffton Town Council rejected Tuesday a proposal that would have required retail stores to follow a series of coronavirus precautions or risk potential fines.


   


  Instead, council members said they plan to consider Thursday a resolution that would urge rather than require businesses to follow the guidelines.


   


  "I think it's good to put down on paper what we want people to do," Mayor Lisa Sulka said during a meeting that was held by video conference and broadcast to the public on Facebook.


   


  Some council members said they had reservations about parts of the proposed emergency ordinance on Tuesday's meeting agenda. The plan was presented to council as more Lowcountry stores reopen after Gov. Henry McMaster began loosening restrictions on some businesses that had been ordered to close in an effort to slow the coronavirus' spread.


   


  Public health officials said there were 5,613 confirmed coronavirus cases in South Carolina with 177 deaths as of Monday. In Beaufort County, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control said there were 254 confirmed cases and estimated there were another 1,560 unconfirmed cases. Officials say there have been 10 coronavirus-related deaths in the county.


   


  The proposed ordinance would have required Bluffton businesses to follow a series of social distancing, cleaning and hygiene measures or face fines of up to $100 per violation through May 17. It would have authorized the Bluffton Police Department and the town's building inspection division to inspect businesses to determine if they were following the guidelines.


   


  The proposal's requirements for businesses included signs encouraging employees and customers to follow social distancing and other recommendations from public health officials, monitoring employees for COVID-19 symptoms, cleaning many surfaces "either twice a day or after each use," having employees wear face coverings and making hand sanitizer available at certain locations, among other rules. The city of Charleston passed a similar ordinance last week.


   


  Council members pointed out the expenses that would be required for businesses to meet some of the demands like signage and that many employers already have been following public health guidelines. Councilman Dan Wood said the town should wait to see if McMaster's task force on reopening businesses makes any recommendations.


   


  "It should be noted that a lot of our businesses are already implementing a lot of what's being stated here," Councilwoman Bridgette Frazier said.


   


  The proposal failed when no council member made a motion to approve it. Council members asked town attorney Terry Finger to revise the ordinance as a resolution they can consider at a work session scheduled for 6 p.m. Thursday.


   


  Council discussed keeping in the resolution a proposal to encourage people to wear protective masks when they are in retail stores, similar to one passed last week by the town of Hilton Head Island.


   


  The resolution also would offer support for McMaster's recent executive order that outlined some social distancing and sanitation rules for businesses. It could urge businesses to practice the list of more specific recommendations that was in the proposed ordinance, council members said, but it would not be required or enforced.


   


  "I think it's a matter of a (public relations) campaign for us to highly recommend to our local businesses and our citizens what we feel is in the best interest," Wood said.

When the coronavirus first started to spread across the U.S., back before schools had shuttered and before we were told to stay at home, my then 4-year- old daughter looked at me one evening after overhearing the evening news on TV.      Her lip quivered and her eyes filled with tears.      "Mommy, am I going to get that virus?" she asked.      I assured my kids that no, the virus never makes kids very sick and that it's only the very old people or people with health problems that get seriously ill. While we still need to wash our hands and be careful about symptoms, I assured my kids that everything was going to be fine. I told them that life as we know it would continue.      Looking back, only two months ago, I had no idea that we would be where we are today. If only things were as simple as washing hands.      Things hit home for me in late March, when, while texting an old friend in the New York City area about the difficulties of trying to work from home while homeschooling the kids, she told me her 10-year-old son was sick. It was COVID-19. Because of the onslaught of the virus, it was almost impossible to find any kind of disinfectant, masks or gloves. The family had been staying home, much like we all are, and yet their son still got sick.      My kids started praying for the boy every night. I had some masks, extra Lysol wipes and hand sanitizer that I had bought back in February, and we packed them up, along with candy and homemade get-well cards that my kids made, and shipped the box to Brooklyn. Thankfully, the boy's symptoms were fairly mild, and after two weeks, the fever dissipated and he recovered.      But not every child has been so lucky.      Last week, 5-year-old Skylar Herbert in Michigan became the first child in the U.S. to die of COVID-19. Like so many other girls her age, like my own 5-year- old daughter - she loved dressing up and performing and loved all things "bling." A kindergartner, she loved going to school and began reading when she was only 4.      But last month she started complaining of headaches, the Washington Post reported. And within days she was hospitalized with COVID-19. She developed a rare form of meningitis, suffered from brain swelling and eventually was put on a ventilator to help her breathe. She did not survive.      She did not have any underlying health conditions.      The majority of the COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. have been people who are over age 60 or people who have underlying health conditions. But there have also been critical cases among the young and people without underlying health conditions who have also ended up on ventilators and some who have died.      According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 21,050 COVID-19 deaths as of April 22. Three of the deaths were in children age 14 and younger, 21 deaths in people age 24 and younger, and 585 of the people who died were between 25 and 44.      There is no sure way of knowing how many people ended up on a ventilator and survived, or how many people have actually had the virus. Without widespread testing, we won't really know how many people have antibodies or how many people have the virus but are asymptomatic.      In the last couple of weeks, people have protested across the country, saying that businesses should re-open and stay-at-home orders should be lifted for the sake of the economy and their personal rights to do business as they please. While states like Georgia have started to lift their business closures, despite not yet reaching a peak on COVID-19 cases, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey announced last week that she will not lift the statewide stay-at-home order yet.   When she lifts the restrictions, Ivey said the decision will be based on data. Currently, the state is testing about 1% of the population for COVID-19, and Alabama doesn't have enough information right now about the number of cases out there to lift the stay-at-home order, Ivey said.   For that, I applaud her. I understand the need to reopen the economy and get back to a somewhat normal life. I look forward to the day when I can go back to work and my kids can go back to school. But until we are able to conduct widespread testing to know who for sure has the virus and how many people may be immune, we don't need to rush reopening business as usual, just for the sake of it.      Lives matter, lives like little Skylar Herbert. Lives like my kids', my husband's, our parents, my neighbors - lives like yours. Right now, without a clearer picture of cases, it's too much to risk.   Lydia Seabol Avant writes The Mom Stop for The Tuscaloosa News in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.

Pity, then, that the gameplay is so tedious. You spend a huge chunk of time here carrying out menial tasks, and many of them seem like they’re as drawn out as possible. You don’t just go to the canteen to get a cup of coffee, you go to the canteen, pick up your cup, insert it into the coffeemaker, turn the coffeemaker on, fill your cup, take it out, drink it up, and do it again -- while also pausing to eat dehydrated food. You find that a room has flooded, so you don’t just have to turn the sprinklers off and drain the room, you have to wander through hallway after hallway, occasionally adjusting screws and knobs, finding canisters, manually turning off sprinklers, and then inserting the canisters into a machine and adjusting their flows so that everything drains properly. You don’t just put on a spacesuit and go outside, you…well, you get the picture. Any time Moons of Madness has the choice of making players take one or two steps to carry out a task, and making players take half a dozen or more steps to carry out a task, it opts for the latter. It may be the more realistic option, but it really drains away the dramatic tension.

HYANNIS -- A prominent member of the Cape's Brazilian-American community has launched a campaign to unseat incumbent 2nd Barnstable District state Rep. William Crocker, R-Centerville, in November.
 Michael Mecenas, 42, of Hyannis, said Monday he will be running as an independent.
 Mecenas is a mental health clinician who also works at Boston Medical Center and Cape Cod Healthcare and came to the United States from Brazil more than two decades ago. He has a master's degree in human services and a bachelor's degree in psychology, both from Springfield College.
 Realizing the need for health and wellness services for the local Brazilian community, Mecenas founded the nonprofit Health Ministry community center in Hyannis two years ago and serves as its president.
 "Coming into this country with nothing and now being able to help people is very important to me," said Mecenas, noting those of all backgrounds and ethnicities are welcome at the Health Ministry. "I'm fascinated by Cape Cod and want to make a difference."
 Key issues of his campaign will include mental health services, the opioid epidemic, affordable housing, homelessness, environmental protection, senior services and immigration, according to Mecenas.
 He also said there will be a focus on helping local businesses rebound from the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 "Businesses across the board have been impacted," he said. "We need to help them get back on their feet."
 Mecenas said he was spurred to run by what he perceives as a lack of presence by the incumbent in the community.
 "You need to be known," he said. "When I talk to people, especially minorities, they do not know who their state representative (Crocker) is. I won't just represent one group of people, I will represent everybody in this district."
 There are an estimated 15,000 Brazilian-Americans on the Cape, with several thousand eligible to vote in the 2nd Barnstable District, according to Mecenas, who said a voter registration effort will be undertaken in the community.
 The campaign already has secured enough signatures to get him on the ballot, Mecenas said, and a kickoff event will be held when it is safe to do so. He also plans to launch a website and social media initiative in the near future.
 The 2nd Barnstable District comprises 10 precincts in Barnstable and two in Yarmouth.
 In other news, Thomas Keyes, of Sandwich, a Republican candidate for state representative in the 5th Barnstable District, says he wants Gov. Charlie Baker to develop a plan immediately to address reopening Cape Cod for the summer in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 The suggested plan would include a review of what businesses should or should not be labeled "nonessential" as well as guidelines for restaurants to plan and prepare for opening.
 As Memorial Day approaches, Keyes contends that waiting any longer for an action plan could be "a killer" for the Cape's economy.
 "There are options and protocols that could be implemented, such as reservation-only seating so that restaurants don't get overcrowded," Keyes said. "I am sure many of the local owners have already been developing their own plans and protocols. I believe that our governor should reach out to them and find an appropriate way to allow them to reopen for Memorial Day."
 Keyes will be opposed by Steven Xiarhos, of Barnstable, in the Sept. 1 Republican primary.
 James Dever, of Sandwich, is the only Democrat in the race.
 State Rep. Randy Hunt, R-Sandwich, announced last year that he would not seek reelection. The 5th District comprises Sandwich, two precincts in Barnstable, three precincts in Bourne and one precinct in Plymouth.
 The special election for the Plymouth and Barnstable District state Senate seat between Democrat Susan Moran and Republican James "Jay" McMahon III is just three weeks away, on May 19.
 Moran, of Falmouth, has received the endorsement of state Sen. Marc Pacheco, D-Taunton. Pacheco, who has represented the 1st Plymouth and Bristol District for nearly three decades, is the longest continuously serving member and dean of the Senate.
 McMahon, of Bourne, has been issuing regular dispatches focused on solutions for reviving the region's economy in the wake of the COVID-19 public health emergency, and he said Monday that he is in favor of reopening golf courses in the district.
 "While golf courses are considered 'nonessential' businesses according to the governor, it doesn't make sense to keep them closed," he said. "The game naturally keeps players at social distancing. It is also a good form of exercise. And, it gets people out of the house!
 "Golf courses can easily adopt reasonable measures and guidelines to keep golfers safe," he said. "That's why I believe that we need to allow all of the Golf Courses in the Commonwealth to open immediately."
 The winner will succeed former state Sen. Viriato "Vinny" deMacedo, R-Plymouth, who resigned in November to take a job at Bridgewater State University.
 The Plymouth and Barnstable District comprises Bourne, Falmouth and Sandwich in Barnstable County, and Kingston, Pembroke and Plymouth in Plymouth County.

As COVID-19 cases began to quickly overwhelm hospitals, Kelsey Coolahan, an M.D. and Master of Business Administration student at Cornell, started getting messages from friends and family about the healthcare industry’s dire need for personal protective equipment.
 Confronting one of modern America’s worst public health crises in history, hospitals across the country were caught off guard by the sudden surge of thousands of patients; with not enough masks to go around, doctors and nurses have been forced to treat coronavirus patients without sufficient protection.
 Two weeks ago, Coolahan got together with other Johnson Graduate School of Management students — including Katie Colton, Greg Minogue, Sameer Shah and Imani Finn-Garland — to see how she could help. Together, they started the Students for Healthcare Heroes, a fundraiser that has so far raised $5,000 to place PPE in the hands of healthcare workers.
 “To tell you the truth, eight weeks ago I didn’t even know what PPE was. To me — I’m an investment banker — PPE is profit plant and equipment,” said Greg Minogue, a Cornell MBA student who is coordinating the team’s efforts to get other schools involved. “In conversations with Kelsey, I could hear her passion and her frustration and her concern.”
 Minogue realized that while there was no easy solution to COVID-19, the biggest priority was making sure healthcare workers have access to the lifesaving equipment that they need.
 The fundraiser contributes to the organization GetUsPPE, which works to connect healthcare workers to protective equipment. Among its teams and affiliates across the country, GetUsPPE has distributed 500,000 units of PPE to Baltimore, Chicago and the San Francisco Bay Area alone, with hundreds of thousands more in other regions.
 “They have a big focus on equity — they’re looking to really focus on areas that are being hit hardest, and also affecting underrepresented populations, communities of color, rural hospitals, tribal communities, prison populations — helping folks that otherwise wouldn’t get the funding and the resources,” Minogue said.
 In addition to distributing PPE, the organization also vets the safety of new designs and posts them to their website to “empower makers and fabricators to craft open-source alternatives that have the best chance of utility in the hospital setting,” GetUsPPE said in an emailed statement. In recent months, the market for protective gear has been flooded with scams and defective equipment.
 The Students for Healthcare Heroes fundraising initiative started out as a grassroots effort, with members of the organizing team sending out emails to as many Cornell departments and student organizations as possible. Now, they’ve brought other business schools on board, including Harvard Business School and the Carnegie Mellon Tepper School of Business.
 The team encourages donations to the cause, but hopes that students across the country will get involved in whatever way they can to support healthcare workers in the fight against COVID-19.
 “Donations are our number one priority, but we understand that not everybody can donate money at this time,” said Katie Colton, a Cornell MBA student coordinating the team’s University outreach efforts. “So any advocacy people can do … would be really helpful.”
 So far, the fundraiser has reached its initial goal of $5,000 in two weeks, with over 90 percent of the total amount coming from Cornell alone. They are aiming to double that amount in the coming weeks, setting a new goal of $10,000.
 While its first round of fundraising will likely conclude in late May, the organizers are looking ahead to the potential of renewed need in the fall, when the combined effects of flu season and COVID-19 could cause a new wave of infections, according to Minogue.
 The team hopes that their fundraiser will lay the foundation for a network of support among business schools, continuing to contribute to the battle against coronavirus as the crisis evolves in coming months.

To that ever-growing list, you can add Blood Breed. I suppose it stands out from all those other games by virtue of the fact it tries especially hard to earn that M rating, with lots of over-the-top gore and polygon-based nudity, but I don’t know that this qualifies as an accomplishment. If anything, it feels more like a bargain budget horror game from the ‘90s (or, going back further, a bargain budget slasher film from the ‘80s) that overcompensates for being thoroughly terrible by trying to push the envelope well beyond the realms of good taste.
