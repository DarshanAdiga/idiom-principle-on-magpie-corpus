But on Election Day, there was widespread voter intimidation against African- American Republican voters throughout the South. Three of those Southern states – Florida, Louisiana and South Carolina – had Republican-dominated election boards. In those three states, some initial results seemed to indicate Tilden victories. But due to widespread allegations of intimidation and fraud, the election boards invalidated enough votes to give the states – and their electoral votes – to Hayes. With the electoral votes from all three states, Hayes would win a 185-184 majority in the Electoral College.

CALLAWAY COUNTY – 2020 was fraught with surprises for Silvia Sprinkle, and it was not because of the virus.
 Earlier in the year, Sprinkle's three grandchildren moved in. For Sprinkle, it was a welcomed opportunity for family time.
 Her grandchildren, however, all have KCNB1, a rare genetic disorder.
 Within the past month, Sprinkle's brother also moved in. Her brother is a US Navy veteran and a double amputee.
 As a result, accommodations were needed to create an accessible environment for the family.
 Sprinkle is no stranger to lending a helping hand. She has organized "Kids in Crisis" for the past several years, which provides resources to families in need.
 But this weekend, Sprinkle received the good kind of a surprise; she would receive a helping hand herself.
 "I'm used to going on Facebook and asking for stuff for other people," Sprinkle said. "I'm just not, it took a lot of pride to just get on there and just bare myself."
 After posting in a local Facebook group for assistance building a ramp for her brother and grandchildren, Sprinkle learned the community had stepped up to provide it for her free of charge; labor included.
 The materials were donated by Rough Around the Edges, LLC.
 Contractor Andy Griffith of AG landscaping assembled the ramp with the help of J-Bar Construction.
 Sprinkle said she feels grateful to the community for its help.
 "It's the small things that are going to help so much and get us all through the country being so divided right now," she said.
 Pat Rowe Kerr, a veteran's and disability rights advocate, donated a van chair lift for Sprinkle's brother. She said it is important to provide for the needs of veterans and children with disabilities.
 "Everybody needs an opportunity to move forward in life," Rowe Kerr said.
 Rowe Kerr recommended that veterans in search of help reach out to their local VFW or VA. Sprinkle said MU's Thompson Center has been a great resource in providing occupational therapy for her grandchildren.

 The last time that foursome of former national championship programs was unranked at the same time was Oct. 13, 2013. Though that season Michigan State would finish No. 3 in the country. The other three were out by the end.
 Since Nebraska joined the Big Ten in 2011, there has not been a season in which at least one of those four traditional powers has not finished the season in the Top 25.

They see that the party is not making the gains that they're supposed to be making. You can't run against some of the most unpopular people ever to have existed in politics and lose, and then still expect to maintain your position of power.

As the Steelers and everyone else move into the second half of the schedule, they should look at Sunday as a cautionary tale. It surely was that for the Buccaneers, who looked lethargic and confused in only their biggest test so far this season.
 Same for Seattle, which had a difficult chore in traveling cross-country to Buffalo and then having an early kickoff. But the Bills, who have struggled a bit the last month, blew away the Seahawks in the first half, toying with a defense that was practically invisible for the first half of a 44-34 Buffalo win.
 "What I will tell you is I don't recognize that game. We haven't seen us look like that, and it's a game that I don't have any place in my brain for it," coach Pete Carroll said. "It's just such an out-of-character game across the board that I don't even recognize us."
 But it happens to virtually ever club some time during a 17-week schedule. During 2020, with all of the pandemic-related issues, it is even more difficult to remain on an even keel. Being stoked in every situation? No way.
 So when the Steelers line up against the Bengals (2-5-1) next week, and the Packers (6-2) face the Jaguars (1-7), they should keep Week 9 in mind. Ditto for the Buccaneers (6-3) against the Panthers (3-6), and the Ravens (6-2) against the Patriots (2-5 heading into Monday night's game at the Jets).
 And so on through November and December. Remember, overcoming lethargy and still succeeding is a rare, irreplaceable quality.
 "I think it just shows a mental toughness," star Steelers defensive lineman Cam Heyward said. "The last three games have been on the road, played quality opponents. Guys are hungry. Takes different guys to step up each game.
 "I'm glad we're in a position where everybody has to chase us."

Oil prices rose more than 2% on Monday, with Brent futures topping $40 a barrel, after Joe Biden clinched the U.S. presidency and buoyed risk appetites, offsetting worries about the impact on demand from the worsening coronavirus pandemic.
 Brent crude futures for January climbed 94 cents, or 2.4%, to $40.39 a barrel by 0710 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for December was at $38.07, up 93 cents, or 2.5%.
 Oil recovered from a 4% decline on Friday, rising along with other financial markets after Biden emerged as the winner in the U.S. presidential race on Sunday. Meanwhile, the dollar weakened, boosting commodities priced in the greenback as they became more affordable for investors holding other currencies.
 "Trading this morning has a risk-on flavor, reflecting increasing confidence that Joe Biden will occupy the White House, but the Republican Party will retain control of the Senate," Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.
 "The outcome is ideal from a market point of view. Neither party controls the Congress, so both trade wars and higher taxes are largely off the agenda."
 U.S. President-elect Biden and his team are working on tackling the worsening health crisis. The United States became the first nation worldwide since the pandemic began to surpass 10 million COVID-19 infections, according to a Reuters tally on Sunday.
 "There will be some repercussions further down the road," said OCBC's economist Howie Lee, raising the possibility of lockdowns in the United States under Biden.
 "Either you're crimping energy demand or consumption behavior."
 Separately, U.S. oil production is set to climb as producers are tapping into a backlog of drilled wells left uncompleted to boost output. The number of operating oil and gas rigs in the United States rose for an eighth week last week, according to Baker Hughes.
 Key members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are wary of Biden relaxing measures on either Iran or Venezuela in years to come, which could mean an increase in production that would make it harder to balance supply with demand.
 ING analysts said the return of Iranian oil supply is more likely to happen at end-2021 or in 2022.
 OPEC and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, are cutting output by about 7.7 million barrels per day to balance global oil markets.
 China, the world's top crude importer, posted a 12% decline in October imports compared with September.
 This data may be bearish for global commodity markets, said OCBC's Lee: "China might be near the end of what it needs in the raw commodity form given the amount of stockpiles that it has."
 Some analysts, however, expect imports to rise into 2021 after Beijing increased quotas by 20%.      (Reporting by Florence Tan; Editing by Gerry Doyle, Tom Hogue and Kim Coghill)

There are a lot of Canadians who are in the state working in various levels of sports. There are people who have played in the Canadian Football League who are coaching in the state now. We have every day Canadians living here who like to go “south” for the winter, and high school teams sometimes compete with Canadian hockey and basketball teams.
 Perhaps the biggest influence is with CP Rail. It owns track across the state, from Portal to Hankinson, and has hundreds of employees working in North Dakota. They are, of course, Americans who are working on the steel rail for CP, but their paychecks originate in Calgary. That Alberta city is where Enbridge has its headquarters, and thousands of workers came down from Calgary to work in the Bakken during the oil boom.
 One could argue that this is all superficial, but what it boils down to is money, and money translates to prosperity, and yes, even today, there is a small percentage of North Dakota’s gross domestic product that is based on the Canadian dollar. But it’s always been this way. We just don’t think about it. You can go back in history to territorial days and find cross-border exchanges all the time.
 Two Canadian companies, the Northwest Company and the Hudson’s Bay Company, were the first two Canadian organizations in the 1790s to do business in what is now North Dakota. Back then Canada didn’t exist as we know it, and they were spending the British pound, but nonetheless, it was other than U.S. currency being traded in what is now Pembina County.
 Minnesota doesn’t have this, outside of International Falls and Roseau, nor does Montana. In this respect, Canadians favor North Dakota just as they do Vermont, New York, Upper Peninsula Michigan, and Washington.
