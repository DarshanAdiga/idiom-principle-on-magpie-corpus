Meanwhile residents of the small Oregon town of Phoenix, near the California state line along Interstate 5, walked through a scene of devastation after one of the state’s many wildfires wiped out much of their community. A mobile home park, houses and businesses were burned, leaving twisted remains on charred ground.
 Many of the residents were immigrants, with few resources to draw on.
 Artemio Guterrez stood helplessly next to his pick-up, surveying the rubble of his mobile home. His children sat quietly in the truck bed and waited for him to salvage what he could. He was able to find a ceramic pot with a smiley face on it, some charred miniature houses from a Christmas-themed village and a cross that formed when two pieces of glass melted together.
 Guterrez, a single father of four, had been at work at a vineyard nearby when he saw thick smoke spreading through Rogue River Valley. He raced home just in time to snatch his kids from the trailer park where they live alongside dozens of other Mexican families. They got out with just the clothes on their back.
 “I’m going to start all over again. It’s not easy but it’s not impossible either. You have to be a little tough in situations like this,” said Guterrez, who had just returned from his mother’s funeral in Mexico. Entire mobile home parks with many units occupied by Mexican immigrants who worked in nearby vineyards or doing construction were reduced to ash in Phoenix and nearby Talent.
 “We’re kind of like a family. We’ve known each other for years, since we came here or even before then,” Guterrez said of his neighbors at Talent Mobile Estates. “We’re living day by day.”
 As the fire approached Phoenix, Jonathan Weir defied evacuation orders, even as flames 30 feet (9 meters) high shot from trees. Fearing for his life, he drove his car to the entrance of a nearby mobile home park, where his tires began melting. His home was destroyed as the fire hopscotched through the town of 4,000 residents.
 “There were flames across the street from me, flames to the right of me, flames to the left of me. I just watched everything burn,” Weir told a reporter.
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency estimated that 600 homes were burned by the fire that started in Ashland and tore through Phoenix, the Mail Tribune of Medford reported.
 Oregon officials haven’t released an exact death count for the wildfires but at least four fatalities have been reported in the state. One person was killed in wildfires in Washington.
 Oregon officials were shocked by the number of simultaneous fires, which stood at 37 Thursday, according to the state Office of Emergency Management.
 Gov. Kate Brown said more than 900,000 acres (364,000 hectares) — greater than the size of Rhode Island — have burned in Oregon in the past three days — nearly double the territory that burns in a typical year.
 Back in Phoenix, Marty Curtis considered herself lucky. Her house was spared and she escaped with her cat, Louie.
 “You could see the flames. You could hear things popping — gas tanks and propane tanks exploding,” she said. “I have my house. I have my life. I have my cat and I have my job — and right now, that’s all I need.”

One-hundred and fifty years ago, Wyoming Territory became the first place in the world to give women the right to vote and hold office. In September of 1870, Laramie’s Louisa Swain became the first woman to cast a ballot.
 “This exhibit examines the major successes, the struggle for women in politics, their challenges and how they’ve overcome that,” Cease said.
 The exhibit is located in the prison dining hall alongside an ongoing exhibit about May Preston Slosson, who became the first female prison chaplain in the United States in 1899. Slosson was also the first woman in the United States to earn a doctoral degree in philosophy, and she was active in the suffrage movement.
 “She worked nationally for women’s right to vote and suffrage, and she talked around the world about that,” Cease said.

“(For) every single death among a Wyoming resident that we have reported, a health care provider or the certifying provider or coroner has determined that COVID-19 was a cause or contributor to death,” Harrist said.
 “If somebody has COVID-19 and they die in a car accident, is that counted as a COVID-19 death? The answer is no,” Harrist added. “The provider in that category is going to determine that the cause of death was trauma.”
 The comments from the Gillette legislators drew some pushback from Rep. Andi Clifford, D-Riverton. The representative from the Northern Arapaho Tribe commended Harrist for implementing the statewide health orders.
 “I’d rather err on the side of safety, and by no means do I think that you handle that with a .45 revolver,” said Clifford, who then asked how many more deaths could’ve occurred on the Wind River Reservation without any orders in place.
 “We’ll never know” exactly how many COVID-19 cases and deaths were prevented by the orders, Harrist replied, adding to the difficulty of proving how effective they’ve been to skeptics.
 “Do I think it would’ve been more deaths (without the orders)? Yes, of course I do,” the health officer said.
 Beyond his broader criticisms, Clem also pushed for changes regarding public health orders for residents of nursing homes and long-term care facilities.
 Initially, the state’s orders largely prohibited visitations to the facilities, though those restrictions were relaxed in June to allow for limited outdoor visits between residents and their loved ones.
 “In order to protect their public health, it’s come at the cost of isolation, loneliness — so mental health, emotional health, spiritual health, which also affects physical health (and) a sense they’ve been in a makeshift prison since March,” Clem said.
 Harrist said her hope is to further loosen restrictions on nursing homes to possibly include some indoor visitation by the end of September.
 Additional tweaks to the state’s three public health orders could also be on the horizon. While there likely won’t be any drastic changes to the health orders set to expire Sept. 15, Gov. Mark Gordon said Wednesday that state officials are looking at changes to accommodate indoor contact sports and other athletic competitions.
 The discussion Thursday began as a review of the laws outlining Wyoming’s response to public health emergencies, and members of the committee ultimately voted to draft a bill establishing a task force to review the topic.
 “I like the idea of us going forward with a collective effort to look back on this thing,” committee co-chair Sen. Bill Landen, R-Casper, said at the end of the meeting. “I just feel like right now, being in the throes of this thing, we don’t know how our schools are going to respond to this ... I think we’ll know more in November.”

I came up with the idea of a mobile game tackling a mental health issue, specifically the mild to moderate symptoms of the obsessive-compulsive disorder. Building a gamified product with positive impact got everyone on the team very excited a and what had seemed like a far- fetched idea at first quickly developed into a tangible concept. We partnered with the Czech National Mental Health Institute and applied for a grant together — if our application succeeds, we will bring the game to life in the coming months. And this project also served as the foundation for setting up the new team — Flying Kale.

WASHINGTON (AP) — As the nation marks the 19th anniversary of the Sept 11 attacks in the midst of another unfolding tragedy, the men vying to lead the nation next year will pay their respects at the same memorial — without crossings paths.
 President Donald Trump and his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, will both be traveling to rural Shanksville, Pennsylvania, Friday, where the hijacked Flight 93 crashed in a field, killing everyone on board. While Trump will speak at the site's annual memorial ceremony held Friday morning, Biden will visit later, in the afternoon, after attending the 9/11 Memorial & Museum’s annual commemoration at Ground Zero in New York, along with Vice President Mike Pence.
 While Trump and Biden's visits will not overlap, the day will nonetheless bring the two candidates the closest they've been in months. And though the candidates and country will be focused on the commemorations, the political significance of their visits to Shanksville is hard to ignore, with Pennsylvania a crucial battleground state. Trump won there by less than one percentage point four years ago, and Democrats hope they can return it to their column in less than two months.
 Still, Biden insisted that he would steer clear of politics on a national day of mourning.
 “I’m not gonna make any news today. I’m not gonna talk about anything other than 9/11," he told reporters. "We took all our advertising down, it’s a solemn day, and that’s how we’re going to keep it, OK?"
 Trump did not address reporters before boarding Air Force One and his campaign did not respond to questions about whether it intended to halt ads as well.

FOXBORO -- On Sunday afternoon at 1 p.m., Cam Newton is set to make history at an important time in this country. When he lines up under center for the first time, he'll become the first Black quarterback to start a Week 1 game for the Patriots in franchise history. The 31-year-old will also join Jacoby Brissett as the second African American to start at quarterback for the Pats.
 In a year when racial tension is high, Newton understands the importance of the position he's in. Following his own difficult offseason, this quarterback is looking to stand up and lead for his community, his teammates and children.
 "It's a big deal. It's really a big deal," Newton said. "I understand who I am. I understand being an African American in this time, this day, we have to be stronger and sticking with each other more than ever now. This is a great feat to achieve, but at the end of the day, we have to make sure we use our platform for positive reasons and that's what I want to do. I want to prove to people that there's more to a person than what you see on an outer level.
 "I'm a person who got second and third and fourth chances in my life. Yeah, through it all, it should always be about what that person is about not what that person looks like. As long as I have this opportunity to impact and empower the community - whether it's the Black community, whether it's the white community, it doesn't matter what community it may be. I just want to do my part as a good Samaritan on earth."
 This offseason, NFL players have been outspoken about the racial injustice that has occurred within the United States. The death of George Floyd brought the Patriots together this spring. On one day, players and coaches met virtually to discuss social injustice.
 Patriots captain Devin McCourty has been out front talking about these issues for years now. On Thursday, when he was told that Newton will become the first Black quarterback to start a season for the Patriots, he was elated. He said he thought of his nephew and other African American boys who look at someone like Newton and realize they too can dream big.
 "I think it's awesome. As soon as he signed, I started thinking about things like that," McCourty said. "... I think it's an honor. It's something that none of us should take lightly because of the history of our country and different things that have happened."
 Newton understands the impact he can make. He said he idolized Black quarterbacks like Michael Vick and Vince Young while growing up in Atlanta. He said those players, along with Randall Cunningham, Donovan McNabb and Daunte Culpepper, are the main reasons why he's currently in the NFL. Newton said he takes his role as an African American quarterback seriously for his community, but another source of motivation is his children. On Thursday, Newton's kids flew into Boston.
 "I'm even more excited to live up to their expectations," Newton said. "... I want them to know I did it the right way. I was myself throughout this whole time. I did right by people. I was good to people. I was a respectful young man. Through it all, I just love that and want to make the most of it."
 Newton went into detail about his turbulent offseason. After being released in March, it wasn't until July 8 that he signed a one-year deal with the Patriots. Newton prayed, meditated and confided in family and friends about his struggles. Everywhere he went, including the grocery story and daycare to pick up his children, he was asked about his next move.
 With everything that happened, Newton is happy to be in New England and ready to lead.
 "Pressure is when you're looking at your children and you're saying you're 31 and you're not ready to retire, but nobody is calling your phone. That's pressure -- when you don't have control of your destiny," Newton said. "For me, I'm elated, I'm excited, I'm all that and a bag of chips… I have to do right by my community. I have to do right by my children. I have to do right by the Black man who sees me and I never meet. I also have to do right by the white man who sees me and I never meet, too, but looks up to me and thinks so highly of me.
 "Throughout it all, that's me and I'm going to make the most of it."

Thank you for having me! I’m excited to share what I do because it really is all coming together in a way I wish everyone could experience. I studied Applied Psychology in college and thought I’d graduate, go to grad school, and become a therapist. Instead, I hopped into a toxic relationship after college and spent a few years paralyzed by that. I tolerated it for far too long and when I finally had the courage to cut things off I turned to fitness. I didn’t want to blame other people for my problems or get stuck telling my story as a victim or turn to alcohol to ignore my problems, so when I got into fitness my whole world changed. It certainly didn’t happen in a day, but my physical, mental, and emotional health improved so much that I needed to become a CPT to show others how healing exercise can be.

Accordingly, ED conducted investigations which culminated in the issuance of show cause notices to TMBL, its directors, SCB and an official of the SCB for various contraventions of the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA).   "The case was adjudicated by the Adjudicating Authority which is the Special Director, ED Southern Region. In his order, the Adjudicating Authority imposed a penalty of Rs 11.33 Crores on TMBL, headquartered in Tuticorin for recording in its books the transfer of 46,862 shares of TMBL in the names of seven foreign entities which were not approved by the Reserve Bank of India for acquiring the shares of TMBL," ED said.   A further penalty of Rs 5.66 Crores was imposed on TMBL for its act of recording in its books, the subsequent transfer of 27,289 shares out of the above 46,862 shares in the names of two foreign entities without the permission of the RBI. The penalty has also been imposed on the directors of the Board of TMBL, who approved the recording of the transfer of shares of TMBL.   The Adjudicating Authority has held SCB guilty of contraventions of the provisions of FEMA for opening the SCB Project Windmill (Sale Consideration) Escrow Account, without prior permission of the Reserve Bank of India and for having allowed deposits totalling to Rs 113 crores in the said account and for having held 1,12,151 shares of TMBL in SCB Project Windmill (Shares) Escrow Account, ED said.   Accordingly, a penalty of Rs 34 Crores has been imposed on Standard Chartered Bank for the contraventions. In addition, a penalty of Rs 66 Crores has been imposed on Standard Chartered Bank for providing collateral/ guarantee/taking into custody of TMBL shares and original sale deeds of land in lieu of which Standard Chartered Bank, Mauritius granted a loan of US$ 55.40 million (equivalent to Rs 221 Crores) to three foreign entities without any special permission from the Reserve Bank of India.   According to the agency, the penalty of Rs 35 crore was also imposed on M.G.M. Maran, then Chairman and Director of TMBL for having opened, without the permission of the Reserve Bank of India, a bank account in Singapore and for having received foreign exchange to the tune of US$ 68,50,000 (equivalent to Rs 28.08 crores) in the said account from a foreign entity as consideration for facilitating and assigning the rights towards the transfer of shares of TMBL in favour of Katra Holdings Limited and for having failed to repatriate the said foreign exchange of US$68,50,000 into India.

Dr. Torrance Choates recommended to the Sumter Country Board of Education (BOE) the virtual learning format be extended another 9 weeks. The vote passed unanimously. In surveys recently completed, the virtual learning experience has been overall successful for both parents and staff. Dr Choates made special remarks on the increase of parental involvement since the debut of the format. Sylvia Roland reports she has received some calls from parents who find the virtual format to be taxing for working parents who depend upon their children to be in schools during working hours. Roland wanted those parents to know they have been heard, and she understands the stress involved in not having the children enrolled in traditional learning. However, the safety and health of the children and those who encounter them have to be the first priority. Rick Barnes reports that stakeholders have called him asking how sports can go forward, yet there is no face to face school option. Barnes has invited the school staff and the BOE to be actively preparing for the students to return to the classroom.

OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) — The state Supreme Court has cleared the path for signature-gathering to begin in a second recall effort against Snohomish County Sheriff Adam Fortney. Justices issued a ruling Thursday that finalizes the content of recall petitions that will be circulated starting Friday by those seeking to oust the first-year sheriff, The Daily Herald reported. The petitions contain three charges. Two are linked to Fortney’s criticism of Gov. Jay Inslee in April, when he said in a Facebook post that Inslee’s stay-home order amid the coronavirus pandemic was unconstitutional, and that his deputies would not enforce it. The third claim says Fortney “exercised discretion in a manifestly unreasonable manner” by rehiring three deputies fired for misconduct by the previous sheriff. Justices tossed another charge that dealt with a public statement made in a case in which a sheriff’s deputy tackled a Black medical worker who was accused of jaywalking. “We are ecstatic,” said Colin McMahon, a public defender and one of four local attorneys behind the recall effort. Mark Lamb of Bothell, attorney for Fortney, said they were encouraged that the Supreme Court threw out what he called the most extreme of the anti-police claims made by the recall proponents. \"The remaining claims are meritless and will be thrown out by the people of Snohomish County in due time,” he said. To get on the ballot, those leading the recall will have 180 days to gather valid signatures of roughly 45,000 registered Snohomish County voters. If successful, an election would be held after the signature count is certified by the Snohomish County elections office. Fortney did not seek Supreme Court review of another recall petition, filed by Monroe resident Lori Shavlik. Cowlitz County...

However, standard processes and systems cannot be used as-is when you expand from a traditional workforce to a blended workforce. Processes and systems need to be adapted or rethought to be effectively utilized for liquid workers. For example, to de-risk compliance issues, companies should separate employees and contractors into different systems for management and payment. Likewise, onboarding processes will be different for freelancers, emphasizing contractual elements (such as the master services agreement, statement of work and nondisclosure agreements) and enabling the freelancer to hit the ground running from the moment onboarding is completed. KPIs must also be adapted and focus on areas like project success rates and freelancer performance ratings.

Sure, people need to look at email addresses that attachments come from and link addresses before they click on them, but that's not enough in this day and age. The criminals continue to increase their attack sophistication, so we have to become more vigilant and agile in our behavior and tools. Until utilizing data encryption at the file level becomes seamless to the user, organizations will have to continue to fight to keep malicious traffic out. This means carefully managing the use of blacklists for firewalls and web application firewalls (WAFs) and tuning email gateway spam filters. Until our systems can protect information at the file level and control access to them at the organizational level, we will have to expand our toolsets and increase user education if we are to remain safe.

BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Hungary’s prime minister said Friday that he is rooting for the reelection of U.S President Donald Trump because what he represents "is good for Central Europe."
 Prime Minister Viktor Orban said he was in his kitchen when Trump called him Thursday evening and they had a long talk about the pandemic situation in the United States, the U.S. electoral outlook and bilateral issues.
 “What the president represents is good for Central Europe, which is why we are rooting — at least me, personally — for him to win the election,” Orban said Friday on state radio.
 In July 2016, Orban became the first European national leader to publicly endorse Trump’s presidential candidacy. At the time, Orban, who was elected for a third consecutive term, and fourth overall, in 2018 on the back of a ferocious anti-immigrant campaign, said he preferred Trump because of his anti-terrorism proposals and his opposition to “democracy export."
 The Hungarian government is facing proceedings in the European Union for allegedly undermining the bloc’s democratic values and rule of law, including issues like media freedoms, minority rights, the electoral system and academic and religious freedoms.
 Orban also said Friday that it was increasingly common for national leaders to speak informally on the phone and build personal relationships instead of relying on formal diplomatic contacts.

Kamra was banned by IndiGo for his “unruly conduct” on the basis of a directive issued by the Ministry of Civil Aviation. Soon after IndiGo banned Kamra, the government had urged other airlines to do the same. Air India, SpiceJet, GoAir and Vistara promptly announced that they were also barring him.
 The ban on Kamra had triggered a huge controversy, with social media users pointing out that journalists from Goswami’s TV channel have been frequently seen heckling politicians on flights.

Former NYPD Commissioner Bernard Kerik issued a statement on the campaign's behalf honoring the memories of those who died, as well as first responders and "the brave men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces who sacrificed their lives in defense of our freedom and flag since then.”
 The National Park Service, which co-hosts the annual Flight 93 memorial event, had originally said it was planning an abbreviated ceremony this year to minimize the spread of the coronavirus. The agency had been planning a 20-minute “Moment of Remembrance” without a keynote speaker or musical guests. Instead, the name of each passengers and crew member was to be read aloud with the ringing of the “Bells of Remembrance,” according to the agency’s website.
 But after Biden and then the White House announced their plans, the website was updated to reflect a new schedule that included remarks from Trump and the Secretary of the Interior, David Bernhardt.
 The events come as the president is grappling with fallout from a new book by veteran journalist, Bob Woodward, which has refocused attention on Trump's handling of the virus. In interviews, Trump admitted to Woodward that had played down the threat posed by the virus this winter, even though he knew how deadly it was.
 In 2016, the 9/11 memorial events became a flashpoint in the campaign after then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton abruptly left the Ground Zero 9/11 ceremony and was caught on tape stumbling and then falling as she tried to get into a van. Trump also spent the day in New York and paid his own visit to the memorial in lower Manhattan.
 Pence on Friday will be attending the National September 11 Memorial & Museum’s 19th Anniversary Commemoration Ceremony with Biden, along with a second event, the Tunnel to Towers Foundation’s September 11th Memorial Ceremony.
 Friday will mark Trump’s second time observing the 9/11 anniversary in Shanksville, where he made remarks in 2018. Biden spoke at the memorial’s dedication in 2011, when he was vice president.

My hope is that rather than creating a program that focuses on body image and leaves women saying, “okay, now what?” I can combine physical fitness with mental fitness and create a space where women finish my program saying, “wow, I can’t wait to keep going!” I used to think I needed to make a generic program and sell it to as many humans as possible but instead I’ve chosen to take on only a handful of women at any given time to make sure they’re actually heard and taken care of. I truly believe if health and wellness professionals wore the ‘specialist’ hat more than the ‘jack of all trades’ hat then more people would be better impacted for the long haul. It’s all about sustainability for me. If I can get one woman to join my program and leave feeling more confident, understood, healthy, energized, and ready to implement what she learned to keep her momentum going then I have succeeded in having an impact. Quality over quantity!
