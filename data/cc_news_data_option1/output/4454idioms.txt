GOWEN, Rosemarie Mary Veronica (McKenna) 1933-2020 (of course). Please add one vote for Joe Biden for US President, American democracy and civil rights! Rosemarie Mary Veronica McKenna Gowen succumbed to natural causes exacerbated by the stress of the occupant of the White House for the last four years and....2020. Rosemarie transitioned on September 28, 2020 surrounded by the undying love of her daughter and son-in law. Rosemarie leaves behind her more than devoted and ever loving daughter, Jennifer Lee Gowen Cuneo, her beloved son-in law Joseph J. Cuneo, cats BG and Honeybun and extended family and friends. Rosemarie most loved her daughter, son-in law, animals, jazz, singing in response to just about anything, politics, native tomatoes, baked stuffed lobster, concord grapes, style, jade, natural stone jewelry, clouds and most of all, appreciated and had a sense of humor in any and all occasions. And she would want everyone to know that not being in her physical body was the only way to stop her from voting in this election! Rosemarie was born in Boston on January 6, 1933 to Margaret (Maggie) McKenna (1906 -2010). Housing, food and clothing were intermittent during childhood, which left her with a lifelong empathy for those in need and forgotten. Rosemarie found a love for jazz in her early teens that led to a passion for civil rights. She worked as a volunteer knocking on doors for the John F. Kennedy presidential campaign and joined civil rights marches. Her love of jazz in Boston in the 1950s and 60s was timely as she worked as a hat check girl and frequented some of the best jazz clubs and after hour clubs of all time, including The High-Hat and her favorite after hours club, The Pioneer, in the South End of Boston, where she met her future husband, hung out and became friends with politicians and jazz greats, including John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Jr., Nat King Cole, Dizzy Gillespie, Tony Bennett (who gifted her with a cat named Dancer) and others, including her dear friends Sabby Lewis, Lincoln Pope and Erroll Garner (who named his song Solitaire after her, due her habit of playing the solo card game while she listened to him play after hours). Other loved ones and friends that were there to greet her on the other side include her ex-husband, friend and mentor William (Bill) Gowen, lifelong best friend Maureen Cloran, old friends, Sandy Kelly and Billy York, (a proud USPS worker that left her daughter the legacy of a lifelong love of the USPS), her parrots Sid and Jackie, cats Dancer, Tini, Pepsi, KK, Samantha, and dogs Scruffy Duffy and Milly the Beagle. And we both know Jenn's Nana has been waiting for her, too, as her apparition has been sitting in her living room every morning for the last five years! After her daughter Jennifer was born on May 17, 1959, Rosemarie dedicated her heart and soul to providing her with a warm, loving, humor filled home, while raising her to be educated, with a strong moral compass, empathy and patriotism. Her efforts resulted in Jenn having many memories of a happy and secure childhood that included a deep love for her Mommy that never has, and never will leave her. For many years, Rosemarie and her daughter lived in the Chickering Piano Factory in Boston and she was a frequent caller to the Paul Benzequine political talk show on WEEI radio. After raising her daughter, Rosemarie was thrilled to get an opportunity to work for the radio station. She worked as the front desk receptionist and became known as "The Voice" (due to her beautiful speaking voice) and was tapped to do several PSA voiceovers for the station. Rosemarie then took "The Voice" to work for Taylor, Ganson and Perrin, a prominent law firm in downtown Boston. She retired in 2003 and bought a little house in the woods, nearby her daughter and son-in-law in Athol, MA. She has declared that her son-in-law Joe grows the best native tomatoes in the world. And she would know. Rosemarie loved the city of Boston and also treasured her last years in the peaceful and beautiful Quabbin countryside with picture perfect holidays. Rosemarie will be missed every day by those left behind who love her dearly. And her Lovebug wants her Mummy back!

"In 2020, the businesses that have been able to pivot and adjust to the pandemic have thrived while unfortunately other businesses haven't made it," Wise said.
 "At 3M, so much of what we've done ... has been about problem solving and improving our capacity to understand difficulties and driving invention to solve those problems."
 It's not just global juggernauts like 3M and Microsoft that have taken advantage of innovation and technology.
 Indeed, Peesker said the same business tools that help make a big companies successful can work for smaller outfits.
 Take Lane Sales and LS Logistics in Guelph, Ont., for example.
 The company is a third-party fulfilment centre, which warehouses and ships products on behalf of manufacturers to their retail customers in Canada.
 A few years ago, the company invested in business process management software.
 "We were growing our business and wanted to get beyond managing Excel spreadsheets," president Brendan Lane said. "We invested a lot of money but we needed to know for sure what was coming in and out."
 Lane said the growth in online shopping during COVID-19 shutdowns increased demand for his services and the new software was an important part of securing new business.
 "We're a third-party at arm's length, so those tighter inventory controls are essential," he said. "Our customers like to have full visibility of their inventory and business."
 For companies that haven't yet invested in technology and innovation, Peesker shared some advice.
 "It's not too late," he said. "The same platforms that allow a Microsoft or a 3M to be successful in adapting are absolutely available to the smallest of businesses."
 As the second wave extends across much of the country, Peesker said "it is in these moments, where we are most challenged as a country, that innovation is rewarded."
 "If there are any upsides of the pandemic, it's that it has been a catalyst for us to really wake up in awareness to enhance the skill levels of Canadians, and to better prepare Canadian organizations to compete on the global stage."
 This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 2, 2020.

Fundraising was the next item of business. They sold stickers, dog treats that were made from grains that were from when Race Street Brew Works was open in Clearfield, held raffles and made memorial bench sales.
 “We had a lot of different fundraisers and sold a lot of dog treats,” Lauder said.
 The community support was overwhelming, Lauder said, as they created a dog park committee that had actual meetings at the borough building. From there, they have been able to raise more than $8,000 so far.
 “There’s been a lot of community involvement in this,” Lauder said. “It’s just awesome. It’s been 100 percent fundraising and donations.”
 They were all set and ready to go this spring. But then, of course, COVID-19 hit and things got delayed, Lauder said. However, the Philipsburg Borough crew broke ground on it a couple weeks ago.
 Lauder said he has a friend in engineering who helped draw up designs of the park and they plan on being extremely creative when it comes to what it will look like.
 “There’s going to be a big dog side and a little dog side,” Lauder said. “Within each side ... I want to get the community’s input on what we’re going to put in there. I’ve seen a lot of simple things that we can pretty much do for free ... but we’re going to get real creative with that. There’s been a lot of really cool ideas that have come up at past meetings.”
 They will also keep some trees within the park and Lauder said they will try to get a pavilion or two in there eventually, with Lauder stating Watson has some ideas on how they can do that.
 The park, Lauder hopes, should be up and running sometime in the spring for those to utilize, as the borough crew is doing all of the construction.
 Once it is up and running, Lauder said Philipsburg Borough will maintain and run the park. Those wanting to make donations toward it can contact the borough office. Further information on the dog park itself can be found at the “Philipsburg Dog Park” Facebook page.
 “It’s just been a passion project of mine for the last few years and it’s just really cool to see it happen,” Lauder said.

And there is a subtle shift in elevations, even at sea level. On a long par three, the 12th tee, the thunder showers that had been skirting around us all day came roaring. Near the ocean, where it’s difficult to tell which way the weather will go, we had taken our chances, but suddenly the wind gusted strong and the tops of trees sharply bowed their heads. Do we bailout? For a half minute, we were pelted with hard rain, and the idea of actually making our partners widows – which we had joked about when we arrived at Widow’s Walk -- suddenly became real. But just as quickly as it came, the storm passed. We teed up and began our intrepid march toward another green.

The ARCA Menards Series has evolved and developed into the preeminent driver development series in stock car racing. The bridge between local and regional racing and the professional leagues of stock car series nationally, the ARCA Menards Series platform has seen dozens of drivers participate as they made their way up the ladder. Of the 99 drivers that participated in the season openers at Daytona for the NASCAR Cup Series, NASCAR XFINITY Series, and NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series, 86 of them had experience in the ARCA Menards Series, ARCA Menards Series East, and/or ARCA Menards Series West. Thirty-seven of them have accumulated 132 total ARCA Menards Series wins and six championships, twenty-nine of them accumulated 93 total East wins and six championships, and twelve of them accumulated a total of 51 West victories and four championships. All twelve drivers competing for national series titles at Phoenix Raceway have ARCA experience, and ten of them have wins within the ARCA Menards Series platform. Chase Elliott made 12 ARCA Menards Series starts over three seasons, with one win (Pocono, 2013), six top-five, and eleven top-ten finishes. He also scored wins in what is now known as the ARCA Menards Series East (Iowa, 2012) and ARCA Menards Series West (Sonoma, 2016). Brad Keselowski made three ARCA Menards Series starts, two in 2004 and one in 2006 for three different owners. Keselowski didn't fare well in any of the three starts, with a best finish of 17th at Michigan in his final appearance. Keselowski is the son of 1989 ARCA Menards Series champion Bob Keselowski, and won ARCA-sanctioned super late model races at Toledo Speedway before moving up the ranks to NASCAR Gander Truck Series competition. Joey Logano has four career ARCA Menards Series starts to his credit, and he's won half of them (Rockingham, 2008, Pocono, 2009). His worst ARCA finish? Second, twice, at Talladega in 2008 and Daytona in 2009. Denny Hamlin made two ARCA Menards Series appearances, one in 2004 at Talladega and the other at Nashville in 2005. He finished third in his debut at Talladega. Chase Briscoe is the 2016 ARCA Menards Series champion. He won six times on his way to the championship, at Winchester, Iowa, Lucas Oil, Pocono, Chicagoland, and Kansas. He finished in the top five 14 times and had 18 top-10 finishes in 20 starts that season. Austin Cindric has eight ARCA Menards Series starts, with one win (Kentucky, 2017). He has led laps in seven of his eight career starts. He also has two career wins in two ARCA Menards Series East starts, on the road courses at Virginia International and Watkins Glen. Justin Haley began racing full-bodied stock cars in the Late Model Sportsman division at ARCA-sanctioned Toledo Speedway in 2013. He earned the first of seven top-five ARCA Menards Series finishes at the age of 15 in 2014. He has three series wins, at Springfield, Talladega, and Pocono. He is also the 2016 ARCA Menards Series East champion with two wins and 14 top-10 finishes in 14 starts. Justin Allgaier is the 2008 ARCA Menards Series champion, taking the series title with an impressive three-race win streak to close the season. He has eight total series wins in 86 starts. Grant Enfinger is the 2015 ARCA Menards Series champion. In 2014 and 2015, he opened the season with three consecutive wins. Enfinger has 16 total series wins in 95 appearances.

Inditex ha sido uno de los grupos que ha presentado una estrategia más ambiciosa de cierre de tiendas y crecimiento online. La empresa que preside Pablo Isla se ha fijado como objetivo que el 25% de sus ventas sean digitales en 2022, frente al 14% que representaron en 2019, lo que supondrá casi doblar su peso en apenas tres años. El grupo invertirá 1.000 millones de euros en este trienio para lograr la meta fijada, pero en paralelo ha presentado un plan de cierre de entre 1.000 y 1.200 tiendas, en torno al 15% del total, entre 2020 y 2021. El plan afecta a todas sus marcas y a todas sus geografías, incluida España, donde se clausurarán entre 250 y 300 establecimientos. El dueño de Zara acaba de firmar un acuerdo con CCOO y UGT para ofrecer la recolocación a todos los empleados afectados, así como una salida de la empresa en buenas condiciones a aquellos que no quieran ser reubicados. Las conversaciones, que suponen la antesala para el inicio de los cierres, van más allá y contemplan también el impacto que tendrá en la plantilla la digitalización del grupo, fijando aspectos como nuevas categorías o condiciones laborales, lo que da una imagen de la transformación que prepara Inditex. H&M; tiene en marcha una estrategia similar. El grupo sueco ha anunciado el cierre de 50 tiendas netas este año y 250 en 2021, lo que representa un impacto menor respecto a su red global de cerca de 5.000 establecimientos. No obstante, la compañía que dirige Helena Helmersson indicó a principios de octubre que 'el Covid-19 está acelerando el cambio digital en la industria', lo que conllevará un 'incremento de las inversiones digitales, la integración del negocio online y físico, así como la consolidación de la red de tiendas'. Y lanzó un mensaje al mercado: 'La situación actual ha cambiado las condiciones de alquiler de las tiendas. Los acuerdos de H&M; permiten renegociar o salir de una cuarta parte de los contratos de arrendamiento cada año, proporcionando más flexibilidad para adaptar el número de tiendas'. El nuevo plan estratégico de Gap también contempla cerrar tiendas. La empresa reducirá la red en Norteamérica de sus marcas Gap y Banana Republic, las que peor están funcionando en los últimos tiempos, en 350 establecimientos hasta 2023, pasando de 1.216 a 870 tiendas.

There may be some positives in all of this. The restaurants still standing could get stronger and claim more customers. Increased revenue could improve the menu, decor and customer service. The additional funds could be allocated toward better quality foods and advertising costs. Investors, such as Amici Partners Group and private equity firms, could inject much-needed funds into the bankrupt chains. The money may help with rebranding, refurbishing and modernizing the restaurant chain to make it more appealing to consumers. Short term, it looks bleak. In the long run, we could see fewer, but better restaurants.

"A lot of people would say, 'Gee, if I had known there was a question about voting drive-in, I would have parked my car and walked to the polls,'" Hanen said.
 At one point, however, Hanen raised the question of whether drive-thru voting would be permissible on Election Day. Hanen said, while holding up a book, "I'm looking at the statute. It says on Election Day, they're supposed to vote in a building."
 Monday, Christina Ford, an attorney representing Democratic parties that intervened in the case, said that provisional ballots do not have a check box on them to reflect that the voter had cast a ballot at a drive-thru location and that if a voter is found to have intent to vote twice it is a criminal offense.
 Voters relied on county officials, Ford said, and invalidating their ballots would "cause mass confusion" and create a "frantic situation with voters trying to figure out if they could cast a provisional ballot."
 Sunday, the Texas state Supreme Court denied a similar petition on drive-thru ballots. Roughly 10% of the votes cast in person during the early voting period have been cast at those sites.
 In a separate case in Nevada, a judge rejected a Republican lawsuit seeking to halt early counting in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, over the stringency of signature-matching computer software and how closely observers can watch votes being counted.
 President Donald Trump and Republican officials have repeatedly made baseless claims of voter fraud and sought to cast doubt on measures including voting by mail and the use of dropboxes.
 During the hearing, Democratic attorney Ford said GOP claims of fraud in Harris County are non-existent.
 "Plaintiffs argue that drive-thru voting would result in fraud and corruption," Ford added. "There's no evidence of that."
 The hearing began at 10:30 a.m. CT, but public access was limited at the start.
 Reporters and other members of the public were granted access to a teleconference about an hour after the hearing began. A phone line that had been set up for access broke down as the hearing was about to begin. Reporters inside the courthouse were held in the lobby and not allowed into the courtroom due to social distancing measures put in place due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 About 90 minutes after the hearing began, those reporters were eventually allowed into the courtroom.
 Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said the lawsuit fits a broader pattern of GOP-led lawsuits claiming voter fraud.
 "Like so many 11th-hour voting-related suits filed by Republicans in recent weeks, this suit has almost nothing to do with voter fraud," Vladeck, who has intervned on behalf of the defendants, wrote in an op-ed published in The Washington Post.
