BERLIN (AP) ‚Äî Robert Lewandowski scored four goals as Bayern Munich defeated Hertha Berlin 4-3 in a dramatic finale to their Bundesliga game on Sunday.
 The Poland striker converted a penalty in injury time to leave the visitors with nothing but pride after twice coming from behind, from 2-0 and 3-2 down, to make it 3-3 in the 88th minute.
 Bayern coach Hansi Flick said a hectic schedule was having adverse effects on his team, one week after its 32-game run without defeat across all competitions ended in a 4-1 loss at Hoffenheim.
 Bayern's offseason was shorter than usual due to participation in the delayed Champions League final, while last weekend's defeat came days after winning the UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla.
 ‚ÄúThe whole situation, the conditions, how we started the season was not ideal,‚Äù Flick said. ‚ÄúWe're rushing from one game to another.‚Äù
 Flick said his side's concentration dropped after conceding Hertha's first goal.

All street vendors in the city and retailers at the three main markets, including the Devaraja Market, have been directed to get themselves tested for COVID-19 within a week.
 This was decided by the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) authorities in a bid to curb the possible spread of the cases which is on the rise in the city.
 Mysuru reported 1,514 new cases on Saturday ‚Äì the highest since the pandemic broke out ‚Äì sending the authorities into a tizzy. The district has also recorded 798 cumulative deaths and has become a major source of worry for the administration. Hence the authorities though it fit to increase testing in places where there is large public movement and transaction as in case of the main markets.

 With her two-decade-long experience in the Kudumbashree network, Ms. Prasanna Kumari kept up the good work. She was not disappointed, and says they will bag the award for the third time on the trot in 2021 too.
 With Kottukal largely an agricultural village, the CDS has formed the members into farming joint liability groups and made available to them bank loans, interest subsidy, seeds and so on, so as to retain at least 90% of farmer families in the agricultural sector.
 The coastal areas too have witnessed a change. From the days when the women had no idea of what how to start a venture or the technical knowledge required to launching microenterprises such as fish processing, dry fish, fish pickle, curry powder, and even beauty parlours, things have come a long way. The coastal wards alone have 127 neighbourhood groups. All of them have been provided a revolving fund of ‚Çπ15,000, she says.
 An amount of ‚Çπ5 lakh received as part of the ‚ÄòIni Njangal Parayaam‚Äô reality show in 2015 has been utilised for purchasing utensils and table chairs.
 Twenty-one of 36 Haritha Karma Sena members have been registered as a microenterprise unit to make paper bag and cloth bags for sale. They also provide food catering services in uniform.
 Besides 89 Balasabhas, the CDS has formed 42 elderly neighbourhood groups for the protection of senior citizens.
 Community kitchen during the early days of the pandemic, Janakeeya Hotel, awareness programmes, medicine delivery, food for those in home quarantine in containment zones were some of the COVID-19 related activities undertaken.

The Minister also handed over a cheque for ‚Çπ1 crore towards the development of Talacauvery.
 It was also decided that devotees would not be allowed to take a dip in the kalyani and instead holy water would be sprinkled after the Teerthodbhava which is scheduled to take place on October 17 at 7.03 a.m. Teerthodbhava refers to water gushing out from the Brahmakundike at the birthplace of the Cauvery at a specified time to witness which devotees gather in large numbers every year and also take a bath in the large kalyani or pond.
 ## Road repair
 Mr. Somanna also directed the PWD to ensure that all roads connecting to Bhagamandala and Talacauvery were repaired. Police were instructed to ensure proper barricading so that social distancing was not violated.

The last line in John Naisbitt's 1982 book, Megatrends, is "My God, what a fantastic time to be alive." Naisbitt declared that we were living in "the time of the parenthesis, the time between eras." We had moved from an agricultural society to an industrial, manufacturing society and then on to a technological society. Willis Harman concluded that the period between these eras would be characterized as "a wrenching and traumatic transition period," and yet, Naisbitt would describe these transitions as "great and yeasty time(s)." While transitions can be "great and yeasty," they can also be dangerous and chaotic times for individuals, institutions, society, and the very earth itself.
   
 Take this metaphor of "the time of the parenthesis" and apply it to the last four years. There is great turmoil on the political landscape. The political ground is literally shifting beneath our feet. The political system has always been anchored in our values, mores and belief systems. It has been grounded in the Declaration of Independence and in the Constitution with its Preamble, Bill of Rights, three branches of government and system of checks and balances. It relies on a restrained use of political power and on a system of governance based on preparation, negotiation, and compromise. While ours has always been an imperfect system involving imperfect people, it has worked. Admittedly, it has not worked equally well for all people, yet it has always rested on its inherent promises that we can do better. The election of 2016 marked the beginning of this new political parenthesis. It has proven to be an anomaly. We are experiencing a surreal political reality, where qualifications are replaced with loyalty, truth, as we have understood it, is no longer truth, experts are untrustworthy, and facts are re-interpreted as "alternative facts." As early as 2015, we knew we were seeing and encountering things unlike what we had ever experienced politically as a country. It has been like living in Alice's Wonderland, not merely disorienting, but dangerous.
   
 Political life within the parenthesis has not been experienced in the same way by all people. Some would say, "My God, what a fantastic time to be alive." These individuals, viewed as "my people" by the president, hold fast to their sources of information, have bonded with fellow believers, and are faithful followers. On the other hand, those defined as "radical democrats," "those who hate America," the "suckers" and "losers," the "enemies of the state," see things very differently. They would regard this time as chaotic, "wrenching and traumatic." Every parenthesis has boundaries - a beginning and an ending. The question now is whether we will have a beginning and an ending within a four-year time span or will four years become eight? The president is now suggesting that he should get a third term.
   
 The answer to the question rests with us. A positive of having spent time within this political parenthesis is that hopefully we have learned something. We will not transition unscathed, but If we are wise, insightful and creative, the chaos and uncertainty can hopefully be turned into positive change. With eyes wide open, we can learn from our past and not repeat our mistakes. We can emerge a better country by understanding and reclaiming the inherent promises and protections of the Constitution and our system of governance. We have an opportunity to introduce necessary reforms, and to meet a promising future different from anything we have ever experienced or could imagine as a nation. It will mean challenging behavior and words which run counter to proven fact. It will mean standing up and speaking truth to power. It will mean restoring trust and respect. We have the possibility of becoming "our better angels." Our choice. There is a sense of urgency because so much is on the line, and that is why each American citizen cannot sit this one out. When we mail in our ballot or walk into the voting booth, it would be advisable to remember Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. She inquires, "Would you tell me please which way I ought to go from here?" The cat replies, "That depends a good deal on where you want to get to." We have had our time within the boundaries of this political parenthesis for complaining, blaming, hand-wringing, facing our flaws, debating, and learning. Now it is time to vote, remembering the answer to Alice's question "‚Ä¶that depends a good deal on where you want to get to."

Restaurants are also suffering from the changes to the liquor-selling policy, for although they can continue to sell food past 10 p.m., there‚Äôs a lot of profit being lost with alcohol sales forcibly decreasing. Not to mention, profit margins are already tight. Like bars and pubs, restaurants can only serve at half capacity at the moment; and once you account the costs of product, rent, insurance, employees‚Äô salaries, and whatever the business had to pay for COVID-19 safety accessories like plexiglass screens, masks, and hand sanitizer bottles, it‚Äôs a miracle if a restaurant is able to break even at this point.

The Prime Minister mentioned the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC 2016) as one of the key legislative reforms that would help aid India‚Äôs path to self- reliance on a high growth trajectory. The IBC, along with the Goods and Services Tax regime, among other key reforms, were helping in significantly improving the ease of doing business in India and enabling it to emerge as a ‚ÄòMake for World‚Äô platform. He also credited these reforms for a surge in Foreign Direct Investment into India in 2019-2020, to the tune of nearly $74.5 billion, or a significant increase of 20 per cent from the previous year.
 ## A key reform step
 The IBC has been a far-ranging and structurally significant reform that has transformed insolvency resolution in India. Replacing a rather inefficient bankruptcy law regime, the IBC has focused on time-bound resolution, rather than liquidation, as an empowering tool to support companies falling within its ambit. It has successfully instilled confidence in the corporate resolution methodology, and perhaps, more importantly, on creating a possibility for the creditors recouping some of their investments in firms being liquidated or going in for resolution. Its core implication has been to allow credit to flow more freely to and within India while promoting investor and investee confidence. Despite the suspension of the IBC for a limited duration due to the COVID 19 pandemic, in the short, medium and long term, it will prove to have been a timely reform. It will greatly streamline insolvency processes in a sustainable, efficient, and value retaining manner.

_Based on the precedent created Saturday in conjunction with the Patriots- Chiefs game, the Saints-Lions game should be postponed, at a minimum for a day or two, in order to allow further testing to occur (unless it 's quickly determined that Burton generated a false positive). Otherwise, Saints players could (in theory) spread the virus to other Saints players and ultimately to Lions players during the game on Sunday._

Trump's Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, pulled his attack ads off the air during Trump's hospitalization, and on Sunday, he dispatched senior aides to deliver a largely friendly message.
 ‚ÄúWe are sincerely hoping that the president makes a very quick recovery, and we can see him back out on the campaign trail very soon," Biden adviser Symone Sanders said on CNN's ‚ÄúState of the Union.‚Äù
 She added: ‚ÄúThis is a glaring reminder that the virus is real.‚Äù
 Biden was at home in Wilmington, Delaware, on Sunday with no plans for in- person campaigning or other public appearances. Having already tested negative, he is expected to release the results of a new coronavirus test later in the day, and the campaign has pledged to disclose those results and all other future test results for the 77-year-old candidate.
 On Saturday, chief of staff Mark Meadows told reporters outside the hospital, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still not on a clear path yet to a full recovery.‚Äù In an update Saturday night, Trump‚Äôs chief doctor expressed cautious optimism but added that the president was ‚Äúnot yet out of the woods.‚Äù
 Meanwhile, Trump‚Äôs handling of the pandemic and his own health faced new scrutiny.
 Trump‚Äôs medical care is far superior to the average American‚Äôs, with around- the-clock attention and experimental treatments. In the hospital video, he defended his decision to continue campaigning and holding large events during a pandemic.
 ‚ÄúI had no choice,‚Äù said Trump, who refused to abide by basic public health recommendations, including mask-wearing. "I had to be out front. ... I can‚Äôt be locked up in a room upstairs and totally safe. ... As a leader, you have to confront problems.‚Äù

And as the state has dealt this year with another health care emergency, the COVID-19 pandemic, Dubnik said people should accept personal responsibility and do their part to prevent the spread of the virus.
 ‚ÄúWe shouldn‚Äôt need government to tell us how to be safe or smart in our daily activities. I believe without a doubt, if you‚Äôre sick, stay home,‚Äù Dubnik said. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ Use that thing between your ears that the good Lord gave you. Don‚Äôt be out and about.‚Äù
 The pandemic also showed how state government should work to coordinate resources in emergency situations, he said.

La incertidumbre y la preocupaci√≥n crecen cada d√≠a m√°s en el sector de agentes mar√≠timos, luego que el Per√∫ decidiera denunciar el ‚ÄúConvenio para la Unificaci√≥n de Ciertas Reglas en Materia de Conocimientos de Embarque‚Äù, m√°s conocido como Reglas de La Haya. Esta medida, que deja sin efecto el instrumento que regula los servicios de transporte mar√≠timo que se proveen entre dos y m√°s pa√≠ses, deja en la desprotecci√≥n jur√≠dica y en mayor riesgo econ√≥mico a los due√±os de la carga, revela la Asociaci√≥n Peruana de Agentes Mar√≠timos -APAM. ‚ÄúNo estar protegidos bajo estas normas internacionales supondr√° una inestabilidad jur√≠dica y mayor riesgo para la carga, lo que conlleva mayores costos operativos al haberse eliminado la inversi√≥n de la carga de la prueba que proteg√≠a a la carga bajo el paraguas de esta normativa internacional‚Äù, advierte Sabino Zaconeta, gerente general del citado gremio. Asegura que las Reglas de La Haya representan el 90% del marco jur√≠dico que regula el comercio mar√≠timo mundial. ‚ÄúSi el Per√∫ ratifica su denuncia, sin tener claro un plan B respecto a qu√© convenio internacional nos vamos a adherir, se dar√≠a un retroceso para los intereses de la carga, cuyas reclamaciones hab√≠an sido exitosas. Estas no son m√°s que razones artificiosas de funcionarios que ignoran la realidad del sector y la manera como este produce valor‚Äù, enfatiza Zaconeta recuerda que el pa√≠s decidi√≥ tomar estas acciones con el argumento de que las Reglas de La Haya no son consistentes con la Ley General de Aduanas del Per√∫, y la necesidad de incorporar al Bill of Lading (conocimiento de embarque) a los gastos de traslado de la carga al consignatario. Zaconeta, adem√°s, hace eco del an√°lisis realizado por la consultora Intelfin, el cual refiere que el informe del Gobierno ‚Äì en el que se ampara para adoptar las reglas de Hamburgo como √∫nico camino para lograr una adecuada previsibilidad de costos para el usuario de transporte mar√≠timo- carece de una correcta evaluaci√≥n de costos de la cadena log√≠stica, de la identificaci√≥n de aquellos que no ser√≠an previsibles, de una discusi√≥n de por qu√© no lo son y que, por el contrario, supone de antemano que todos los costos log√≠sticos, a excepci√≥n del flete, son imprevisibles. ‚ÄúEsto solo denota un enorme desconocimiento de la econom√≠a mar√≠tima‚Äù, dice el representante gremial. Aclara que, tanto en las operaciones de exportaci√≥n como de importaci√≥n, cualquier due√±o de carga puede conocer de antemano todos los costos de su cadena log√≠stica y optar por llevar a cabo estas operaciones ellos mismos o, en su defecto, contratar agentes de carga que se encarguen de ellas (quienes est√°n en capacidad de proveer un presupuesto preciso de todos los costos involucrados). ‚ÄúLos art√≠fices de retirarnos de La Haya deben saber que la existencia de estos √∫ltimos constituye evidencia de que los mercados de servicios log√≠sticos funcionan correctamente, pues ante la inherente complejidad de las operaciones de comercio exterior, el mismo mercado genera la soluci√≥n‚Äù, explica. Sostiene, adem√°s, que seg√∫n Intelfin la afirmaci√≥n de que existen costos no previsibles en la cadena log√≠stica es, adem√°s de infundada, tendenciosa, pues ello solo puede ser cierto para due√±os de carga poco diligentes, que llevan a cabo operaciones de importaci√≥n sin conocer el costo y procedimiento de las mismas. ‚ÄúEn el mercado de servicios log√≠sticos peruano los proveedores tienen mucho mayor poder de negociaci√≥n frente a las navieras que los usuarios finales, por lo que la supuesta integraci√≥n forzada solo puede resultar en un incremento de las tarifas finales para los due√±os de la carga‚Äù, puntualiza.

The global agricultural fumigants market is driven by factors, like rapid technological advancement in the agricultural sector, growing concerns over the post-harvest losses, and a shift in the advanced framing practices which lead to increased yields. The use of fumigants during storage helps in the reduction of storage loss. Thus, the demand for fumigants is expected to rise, as the use of fumigants is an effective and economical method to reduce post- harvest losses.

"articleBody" : "A healthy sign is now visible in Andhra Pradesh. The social media which was targeting the judiciary for past some time has gone silent. This has led to speculations that the State government has been told by the Centre to see that the social media was reined in or else it could lead to unnecessary clash between the executive and judiciary. This of course also gave rise to another speculation that the political equations in Andhra Pradesh are set to change and that the YSR Congress party may join Modi government. YSRCP had recently denied any such move but speculations are speculations and refuse to die down. It is being said that during the recent meeting the Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy had with the Union Home Minister Amit Shah, the Centre had advised him to see that the social media refrains from making any derogatory comments targeting the judges. They are said to have brought to his notice the displeasure expressed by the Andhra Pradesh High Court over the Crime investigation Department failing to act on the cases of posts on High Court judges. The bench comprising Justice Rakesh Kumar and J Uma Devi felt that there could be larger conspiracy behind such posts against judiciary. The High Court said that the attempts to lower the dignity of the judiciary which is one of the three pillars of democracy and thus calling it redundant could lead to internal strife. The judges were so angry that they went to the extent of saying that court cannot remain a mute spectator to the social media posts destroying the reputation of the judiciary. The court, without mincing words, went on to say that the people who do not have faith in the judiciary can go on to Parliament and seek the abolishment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court. The Centre which needs support of other parties in Rajya Sabha while passing many important bills wants to keep regional parties in good humour. It may maintain the cat on wall attitude regarding the three-capital proposal mooted by the AP government ducking under the alibi that the Centre has no role in deciding where the state should have its capital. May be, like YSRCP, they too are waiting for the decision of the High Court on this issue. The State government on its part is ready to shift the executive capital to Visakhapatnam anytime if the court decision comes in its favour. But what the Centre needs to clarify is will it take similar stand if in future some other government wants to shift capital to some other place? What is more important? Constitutional position or political convenience? Will the Centre also turn a blind eye to the slow progress of Polavaram project and the controversy pertaining to payment of R&R; package to those who gave land for the project. Silence on certain issues may be good policy but not on crucial issues like lifeline projects of the state. Amidst such developments, the decision of the AP Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy to go to Delhi again on Monday and the possibility of meeting the Amit Shah, (his last meeting with Amit Shah was on September 23 and 24) and others gives credence to the political talk that the AP government was moving in the direction of joining the NDA sooner than later.

With increasing agricultural production, the demand for fumigants has been witnessing an upward trend over the years. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations has predicted that agricultural productivity is likely to increase by 70% by 2050, in order to meet the growing demand for food. The production of cereals is estimated to reach 3,009 million metric ton by 2050. However, the expected demand for agricultural crops is around 6,759 million metric ton by 2050. Thus, the demand for agricultural warehouses, storage technologies, and associated products, like fumigants, is expected to increase in the long run. In warehouses, pests damage most of the crops and the use of fumigants decrease the loss of agricultural products. Therefore, this boosts the demand for the agricultural fumigants market across the world.
