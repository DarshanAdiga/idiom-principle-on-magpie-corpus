Apple released the original iPhone SE in 2016 and featured the same A9 processor as the iPhone 6S (Apple's flagship at the time), before it was discontinued in favor of the iPhone 8. For more on how the brand-new iPhone SE stacks up against its predecessor and the pricier iPhone XR and iPhone 11, check out CNET's specs chart below. We also have a more in-depth comparison of the new iPhone SE and iPhone 11 if you're trying to figure you're out which of the two phones to buy. My colleague Lexi Savides didn't feel like she missed out on all that much when she switched over to the less expensive iPhone. You can read more about her thoughts here. But if you've already made up your mind and want to bring home the 2020 iPhone SE, here's how to do just that.

The correct answer to this question is the Toyota Camry, but the _right_ answer is the third-generation Mazda6, which can be fairly easily found fully loaded for under $20,000. With a backseat big enough for kids, a decent-sized trunk and fairly efficient 30 mpg combined from its 2.5-liter engine, the 6 basically does everything the Camry can, but wrapped in much more handsome sheetmetal and, if you're lucky, juicy Soul Red paint.
 So many automakers claim that their volume sedans have the soul of a sports car, but Mazda actually backs it up with sharp handling and much better driving dynamics than anything else in this class. Sadly, you probably won't be able to opt for the more powerful turbocharged engine, which came online in 2018, but the standard I4's 184 hp feels better than it sounds on paper, powering the 6's lightweight chassis.
 Modern driver-aid technologies are available on upper trim levels, but the Mazda6's cabin tech wasn't great at launch. Thankfully, Mazda recently started retrofitting models dating back to 2014 with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, which basically solves most of the sedan's tech woes. Make sure your example has been updated or be sure to swing by your dealer shortly after taking delivery. Look for a Touring or Grand Touring for the most family-friendly tech goodies or -- if you love an engaging drive -- find yourself a pre-2019 Sport model with a six-speed manual transmission.

When I think family on a budget, particularly an active family who lives somewhere it gets cold, my mind typically falls to Subaru, and for this money I think you're best off looking at a Crosstrek. I checked my local dealer inventories and you can easily get yourself into a low-mile, 2016 or 2017 Crosstrek Premium that'll be a perfect fit for most families.
 First off, it's a wagon, so bonus points there. Secondly, standard all-wheel drive means a little more confidence in the winter, or absolutely unstoppable performance should you decide to step up to a set of snow tires. You don't even have to compromise on the fuel economy stakes, with the Crosstrek delivering an impressive 34 mpg on the highway.
 How does an AWD wagon do so well? By having absolutely no power. The gutless, 2.0-liter flat four is paired with a CVT that further sucks dry what little performance it has to offer. But, if you can deal with that handicap, you won't do much better at this price.

Mit seiner ersten Single "Don't Think About Me" war Hänni der erste Schweizer in 52 Jahren, der Platz 1 der deutschen Charts erreichte. 2019 nahm er für sein Heimatland beim Eurovision Song Contest teil und belegte den vierten Platz. Vor seiner "Let's Dance"-Teilnahme konnte er bereits die Tanzshow "Dance Dance Dance" 2017 gewinnen. Ob das ein gutes Omen auf den Sieg am heutigen Abend ist?

The Volt may not seem like a family vehicle, but I assure you it's quite the versatile machine, with phenomenal fuel economy to boot. Granted, this pick is probably best for smaller families, but nevertheless, the Volt is a solid all- around vehicle.
 First of all, it's a hatchback, and the rear seats fold flat to reveal a surprising amount of cargo room. This one time, I squeezed 20 bags of mulch into one. The Volt is also a plug-in hybrid with an estimated 53 miles of electric range at the driver's disposal. With the small battery, you can easily plug it into a household outlet overnight without needing to wait an extraordinary amount of time. Even if you forego charging the car up, the hybrid powertrain delivers 42 miles per gallon. Families won't need to worry about budgeting for fuel all too often.
 Now, the rear seats aren't the most wonderful place, especially with a tight middle seat, but they'll easily strap a couple of kids in the rear and keep them safe. Buyers will find a wide assortment of low-mileage, second- generation (2016-2019) Volts with the more mainstream design well under $20,000. The Premier model will toss in all the goodies, but even a Volt with the Comfort Package includes comforts such as heated seats and a heated steering wheel. Seriously, there's a lot to love about Chevy's now- discontinued plug-in.

Sie ist die letzte Frau im Bunde und wusste in den vergangenen Wochen mit ihrem athletischen Körper umzugehen: Artistin Lili Paul-Roncalli. Profitänzer Massimo Sinató (39) hatte ihr Talent bereits in Show eins richtig eingeschätzt und sie als Tanzpartnerin für sich gewählt - es folgten regelmäßig Bestwerte in den Shows. Auch ein Trainingsunfall vor dem Viertelfinale, bei dem das Tanzpaar mit den Köpfen zusammenstieß, hielt die beiden nicht auf. Im Halbfinale konnte sich Paul-Roncalli gegen drei Männer behaupten und zog ins Finale ein. Mit dem Contemporary holte sie sich in der Show 30 Punkte von der Jury ab. In dem Tanz verarbeitete Paul-Roncalli eine derzeit schwierige Phase in ihrem Leben, wie sie danach im Interview mit spot on news erklärte. Sie habe versucht ihre Gefühle zu tanzen, "die ich derzeit habe, wenn ich daran denke, dass unser Circus und Varieté [aufgrund der Corona-Pandemie, Anm. d. Red.] nicht spielen dürfen.

Turn the time machine's dial back about five years to get the most out of your $20,000 or under. A used Toyota Sienna will deliver just about everything you need in a family vehicle, probably with some room left over, to boot.
 There's a fresh new generation of the Sienna arriving later this year, but the version that was revealed several years ago and updated for 2017 remains at dealers. Thus, you can reach a little further into the used market without bumping into hella-outdated technology. And it's still a minivan no matter what, so you get oodles of space for both cargo and people.
 An older variant is still pretty decently equipped under the hood. Its 3.5-liter V6 produces 266 hp and 245 lb-ft of torque, while achieving 18 mpg city and 25 mpg highway with front-wheel drive. Spend a little extra on all- wheel drive -- yes, it was available even back in 2015 -- and you lose some fuel economy in favor of a little extra bad-weather traction.

Some folks insist that many separate ingredients, including flour, sugar, baking soda, eggs, butter and a contraption called a sifter, are required for cookies to be truly homemade from scratch. However, in my view, if the cookies were sitting on a store shelf with the word "Oreos" on the package, and if the oven in your kitchen was used, then the cookies definitely should be considered "homemade" and "from scratch."
