Drew Brees won the battle of the all-star quarterbacks, throwing four touchdowns as Tom Brady suffered the worst loss of his career in the New Orleans Saints 38-3 blowout of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday night in Florida.
 Brees threw touchdown passes to four different receivers as the Saints easily won the showdown for first place in the NFC South Division.
 "He had all his weapons on field too. So I thought it would be one of those games," said Brees of the marquee matchup. "We have been playing against each other for 22 years now so there is a lot of respect there."
 Brees completed 26 of 32 passes for 222 yards and 12 different receivers caught passes on the night, while Brady threw three interceptions and had no touchdowns at Raymond James Stadium.
 Brees's four touchdown passes allowed him to vault over Brady in their back- and-forth battle for the NFL's all-time touchdown record. Brees now has 564 career touchdown passes while Brady sits at 561.
 It was the most one-sided loss of a legendary career for Brady as the Saints scored three touchdowns before Brady even registered a first down. He completed 22 of 38 passes and Tampa Bay rushed the ball just five times, the lowest total in league history.
 "I can't say enough about our pass rush and our front four," said Brees. "Tonight was a great night. It was pretty special, exceptional."
 Kicker Wil Lutz booted a 36-yard field goal late in the second quarter as New Orleans led 31-0 at the half.
 "We can't waste a win. We wanted to spread the ball around," said Brees. "The offence was able to possess the ball, run the ball well, and throw the ball well."
 In Buffalo, quarterback Josh Allen guided the offence by throwing for three touchdowns and Buffalo's sturdy defence forced four turnovers as the Bills delivered the Seattle Seahawks their second defeat in three games with a 44-34 win.
 Allen finished with a whopping 415 passing yards and added a rushing touchdown to outgun Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson in the clash between the division leaders.
 Wilson completed 28 of 41 passes for 390 yards but he had two interceptions for the Seahawks, who fell to 6-2 in the NFC West. He also gave up two second- half fumbles while being sacked as the Seahawks attempted to rally from a 24-10 deficit at the half at Bills Stadium.
 "We are capable of doing whatever we want to do. We have all of the pieces here, and we just have to continue to do things right on and off the field," said Bills team captain Dion Dawkins.
 Elsewhere, quarterback Patrick Mahomes passed for four touchdowns and 372 yards as the Super Bowl champion Chiefs won their fourth consecutive game by edging the Carolina Panthers 33-31 in Kansas City.
 Tight end Travis Kelce, who is one of Mahomes's favourite targets, grabbed 10 passes for 159 yards for the AFC West-leading Chiefs (8-1).
 Mahomes now has 101 touchdown passes in 40 career games, surpassing Dan Marino who was the previous fastest to 100 in 44 games.
 Mahomes completed 30 of 45 passing attempts and teamed up with receiver Tyreek Hill for two fourth-quarter touchdowns. Hill finished with nine grabs for 113 yards.
 In Indianapolis, reigning league MVP Lamar Jackson rebounded from a sub-par game last week to gain 228 yards of total offence as the Baltimore Ravens handed Indianapolis their first loss at home this season with a 24-10 win.
 Quarterback Jackson had a rushing touchdown and Gus Edwards ran for another score as the Ravens improved to 6-2 on the season.
 Jackson grabbed a slice of history as he equalled the best 30-start mark of the NFL's Super Bowl era.
 He is 25-5 since becoming the Ravens' starter, tying retired Dan Marino of the Miami Dolphins for the best start by a quarterback since the mid-1960s.
 Elsewhere, it wasn't pretty, but the Pittsburgh Steelers rallied from a 13-point deficit against the Dallas Cowboys to reach 8-0 for the first time in franchise history.
 Minkah Fitzpatrick knocked away a pass in the end zone as the Steelers held on to beat the Cowboys 24-19 at AT&T; Stadium.
 "I'm really proud of our football team," coach Mike Tomlin said. "Eight and zero for the first time in franchise history. We're humbled and honored to be that group."

“We’re artistes at the end of the day. I’ll not stop doing the work,” quoted Ali. The Mirzapur star cited the example of late actor Irrfan Khan, who had done many good films in Bollywood and Hollywood. Ali said Irrfan was an inspiration to many but he never talked much about his work. Ali further said that Irrfan’s last film was Puzzle, a Hollywood film, in which he had done a tremendous job. “We should be all over a performance like that one. And even I had the same question that why don’t people talk about his work more this,” added Ali.

Heading into the election, Mr. Bernstein said he had been taking a slightly more conservative approach to money management than he had in years past, given how much uncertainty was up in the air over the election, the global economy’s trajectory, the pandemic and fiscal stimulus in the U.S. Like some other money managers, he said he was less concerned from a portfolio- management perspective about who won the presidency than who would take control of the Senate.

"I think that's fair to say," Adams said via Packers.com, after finishing with 10 receptions, for 173 yards and his league-leading eighth touchdown catch of the season, in Green Bay's 34-17 win over San Francisco Thursday night. "I think that's not being conceited; that's just being confident. I think obviously what I've done and what I'm going to continue to do is going to prove that, to anybody who isn't on board with that. At the end of the day, I'll tell you yes, absolutely, I think I'm the best wide receiver in the game, but there's a lot of things that go into me being able to make that statement."

One big reason why? The widely held assumption among strategists and pollsters heading into Election Day that Democrats would win control of both houses of Congress is up in the air. Two key Senate races in Georgia are both headed toward a runoff in January. Should Republicans emerge victorious there, control of Congress almost certainly will be divided between the two parties. And that means sweeping policy changes that might benefit or hurt specific industries’ bottom lines look less likely to come to fruition—something that investors took into account as soon as betting markets showed declining confidence in a quick and decisive Democratic sweep Tuesday night.

Even after Takada’s retirement from his namesake label, he continued to collaborate with various brands from eyewear to furniture before launching his own luxury lifestyle brand this January, K3. Teaming up with his longtime creative assistant, Englebert Honorat, and Manheim, K3 presents Japan-inspired furniture, textiles and decorations in collaboration with both European and Japanese artisans. Honorat, who trained under Takada for 10 years, has been appointed as the next creative director, and Manheim says the brand will continue to stand for Takada’s legacy by constantly rediscovering Japan and honoring his enthusiasm and dreams that initially led him to Paris.
 “He was always open-minded, generous and humorous, even at the hospital,” says Manheim, adding that Takada fell into a coma briefly at the American Hospital of Paris before regaining consciousness about a week before his death. “When he woke up from the coma, he said ‘I got to sleep a lot, and I have so many ideas now,’ and was just eager to get back to the drawing board.”
