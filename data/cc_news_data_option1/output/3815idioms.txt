The most inspirational team performance this year. It's just a shame the Warriors won't be playing finals. When the club made the decision to sack Stephen Kearney it looked to me an unbelievably dumb move given the team was stuck in lockdown and away from their families back in New Zealand. But Todd Payten has done an extraordinary job pulling them together, while Roger Tuivasa-Sheck is the standout for the Dally M captain of the year. But across the park they should all take a bow.

Assam is staring at a sharp rise in COVID-19 fatalities as both health care infrastructure and health care personnel are stressed to the limit. The National Health Mission, Assam, floated a tender in the last week of August for 3,000 body bags to be supplied on an “urgent basis due to COVID-19 pandemic”, which indicates the scenario that is being anticipated in the coming days.
 Designated COVID-19 hospitals and care centre beds are almost saturated because of the exponential rise in positive cases. Health experts have said that home isolation could soon be the only option for a large number of patients if the pandemic curve is not flattened as most hospital beds will be filled with critical patients requiring urgent medical attention. Two cryogenic oxygen tanks with a total capacity of 40,000 litres have been installed on the Gauhati Medical College Hospital premises to ensure an uninterrupted supply of oxygen for at least 10 days.
 Until September 16, the State had 29,180 active positive cases and recorded 492 fatalities. The number of fatalities of laboratory-confirmed positive cases could be higher as the State’s Death Audit Board is not counting the death of many people as caused by COVID-19 if they had comorbidities. Assam Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that the board was ascertaining the number of COVID-19 deaths in strict adherence to the guidelines of the Indian Council of Medical Research. He said that if the guidelines were changed subsequently to include the positive cases where the death after recovery from COVID-19 was caused by comorbidities the death count due to COVID-19 might see an upward revision. The number of fatalities of such positive cases is estimated to be around 350.
 Of the total 1,46,575 positive cases to date, 1,16,900 patients have been discharged. The positivity rate is close 7.5 per cent, and on an average over 2,500 new cases are added every day, which has led to the saturation of hospital beds despite the high discharge rate. Over 1,600 doctors and other health care personnel have been infected with the virus, which has aggravated the situation. A large number of police personnel and mediapersons have also been infected.
 With schools and colleges scheduled to reopen on September 21 for pupils of classes IX to XII an increase in positive cases is likely in the coming days. The standard operating procedure that the Central government issued for the reopening of schools mentions that attendance in offline classes should be voluntary and will require consent from parents and guardians. However, schools and colleges in rural areas are likely to witness large attendance because the majority of rural students were deprived of access to online classes conducted by schools and colleges. Data from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India show that rural Assam has only 27.47 Internet subscribers per 100 population against 100.97 in urban areas. The data were included in the report titled “The Indian Telecom Services Performance Indicators, October-December 2019” published on June 30.
 With the 2021 Assembly elections less than eight months away, the State has been witnessing a surge in political activities. Non-adherence to safety protocols such as wearing face masks and maintaining a minimum physical distance has triggered apprehensions of a further deterioration in the pandemic situation. A number of legislators, leaders and workers of both ruling and opposition parties have been infected with the disease. Former Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi, ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Member of Parliament Kamakhya Prasad Tasa, and Topon Kumar Gogoi are among those who were admitted to hospital for COVID-19 treatment.
 In most political gatherings, parties are not adhering to the restriction of only 100 attendees. Electioneering in areas under the Bodoland Territorial Area District (BTAD) has also picked up even though the Assam State Election Commission has not announced fresh dates for elections to the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC), the autonomous council, under which the BTAD areas fall, set up under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution. Elections to the BTC, earlier scheduled for April 4, were deferred following the nationwide lockdown.
 The Election Commission is exploring setting up additional polling stations for staggered polling but is yet to notify fresh election dates. The parties are anticipating that the elections might be held sometime in October-November and are trying to connect with voters through mass rallies. Campaigns are likely to be intensified, putting people in the BTAD at risk of getting infected with COVID-19, if the State Election Commission does not clarify whether the elections will be deferred further or announce fresh dates and safety protocols for campaign and voting.
 The pandemic has adversely affected the State’s economy, and there has been an alarming rise in the number of unemployed, with people forming long queues to register at employment exchanges. The opposition parties have flayed the BJP- led coalition government for announcing a cash assistance of only Rs.830 a month for the 19 lakh targeted beneficiaries of a flagship scheme, Arunodoy, announced in the State budget for 2020-21. The opposition parties insist that the amount is too little and have demanded that all households outside the purview of income tax obligations be paid a monthly cash assistance of Rs.7,500 for the next few months to help tide them over the financial crisis they are facing because of the pandemic. The State government also announced Rs.2.5 lakh each for 8,000 _namghar_ s (traditional Assamese prayer houses) by October 15 for the improvement of infrastructure and directed Deputy Commissioners to select 55 beneficiary _namghar_ s in each Assembly constituency.
 In April, the State government shelved its plans to construct five temporary hospitals for COVID-19 patients with a total of 1,500 beds using funds collected through donations from individuals and organisations to the Assam Arogya Nidhi account. The collection was to the tune of Rs.100 crore. The government made this decision after it evaluated that it would be able to ramp up existing facilities and incomplete infrastructure to meet its requirements. The State currently has around 600 beds and about 400 ventilators in intensive care units (ICU) in government and private hospitals. On September 10, the Health Minister expressed his helplessness and said that there could be a severe shortage of ICU beds if the present trend of the pandemic continues and infections do not decline by October.

Playing a video game with a childhood friend was the catalyst for chef Keith Sarasin's appreciation of Indian cuisine. Now, two decades later, he's helping Americans understand just what he loves about Indian home cooking through a new YouTube channel and a series of virtual cooking classes. The first hour- long class is Oct. 4.
   
 "I had a friend growing up in Nashua, Supreet, and his family owned an Indian restaurant. We would play video games at his house all the time. Walking into his house and just like a wave of scents. They always had spices and food everywhere and they would always try to get us to eat Indian food all the time," Sarasin said.
   
 "I was 13 or 14, and I was a really picky eater, so I said, 'Absolutely not.' One day we were playing a video game and he said, 'If I beat you in this next round, you have to try Indian food.'"
   
 Sarasin was up for the challenge and, luckily for home cooks everywhere, the founder of New Hampshire's The Farmer's Dinner series and cookbook author lost that game.
   
 "He beat me. I had my first experience with Indian food at India Palace in Nashua and I tried chicken vindaloo. It blew my mind. I thought, 'how are they doing this?' It was like sorcery to me."
   
 The next day Supreet invited Sarasin to go with him to a local Indian market, and the chef was once again blown away by what he saw, smelled and tasted. Six years ago, his friend asked him to meet at that market, Food and Fashion of India, once again.
   
 "I walked back in and at the back of the stores was a short little lady wearing a sari, just smiling. Supreet ordered some spices and they talked in Hindi for a minute while I looked around the place flabbergasted," Sarasin said.
   
 "I had been in kitchens for a bit, but I had no idea what a lot of it was. The lady asked me if I wanted to try something to eat, and she went into the back and put this stuff into a styrofoam container and handed it to me. She said, 'I call this 'Indian breakfast.' There was a vegetable with semolina, and I took one bite. I was blown away."
   
 Sarasin says his experience enjoying a dish that really didn't look like much but which was so full of flavor -- sweet, sour, spicy and still balanced -- resulted in a mentorship with Indira Shelat, that little lady who first cooked him an Indian breakfast and who created set lunches each weekday, improvised from what was on hand.
   
 "I begged her to teach me to cook these dishes," said Sarasin. "But she said, 'No, no, no. I'll do it.' I went into her store every day for about six months asking her to teach me something. I started learning the names of the spices in Hindi, because it was important for me to connect with her on that level, and I felt like if I could learn the spice names, she'd be more inclined to teach me."
   
 Finally, Shelat agreed to teach the chef one dish if he would help her with her website. That dish was masoor dal, a spicy red lentil dish.
   
 "Her food was home-style, not refined," said Sarasin. "It didn't need to be. I've been lucky to dine at some of the best restaurants in the world at this point, but I keep coming back to the food that she would make and serve in a styrofoam container and thinking that's the stuff that I miss."
   
 It was through Shelat that the chef also learned the connection between mood and food.
   
 "I would chop some onions and she'd tell me I'm chopping it wrong, you're not dicing it. She'd ask, 'how are you feeling right now.' I said, 'Anxious.' and she would tell me 'you're putting that into your food, you need to clear your head.'"
   
 Over the course of months, and then years, Sarasin said he'd learn more about the spiritual aspects of Shelat's homecooking.
   
 "I'd walk in in the morning and it just smelled like incense, and I'd hear Indian prayers playing on a loop -- her father was a Hindu priest."
   
 Sarasin eventually helped Shelat with catering, including making dishes she was not allowed to touch due to her religious traditions. At one wedding, the bride and groom praised the chicken vindaloo and were surprised when Shelat let them know that "the white guy did it."
   
 Shelat has since retired and while she offered Sarasin the chance to purchase the market, the chef was running Greenleaf Restaurant in Milford. He's since left Greenleaf and can now concentrate on continuing The Farmer's Dinner series where guests will often enjoy a dish from Sarasin's Indian cuisine repertoire as well as his new YouTube channel, which covers Indian cuisine and history and live Indian cooking classes. He's also recently announced a partnership with Chunky's Cinema Pub which includes a series of themed dinner and movie collaborations. Upcoming films include "100-Foot Journey," which features both Indian and French cuisines.
   
 While a planned trip to India is out for the time being, Sarasin is learning Hindi and hopes that by sharing his enthusiasm for Indian cuisine through these classes and videos, more Americans will embrace the dishes and culture he loves.

On Monday, Bavaria premier Markus Soeder warned against the fixture becoming a “football-Ischgl”, referring to the Austrian ski resort where thousands of holidaymakers were infected with the virus at the beginning of the pandemic in Europe.
 “I really get a stomach ache when it comes to the Super Cup” Soeder added of Bayern’s game against Europa League holders Sevilla in a coronavirus red zone.
 Rummenigge echoed Soeder’s comments on Wednesday, insisting Bayern Munich have “every interest in ensuring that no Ischgl of football takes place” in Budapest.
 “I think everyone’s stomachs are churning. The game will take place in a city with a rate of infection of over 100 (per 100,000 inhabitants), which is twice as high as that in Munich,” Rummenigge told broadcaster ZDF.
 “That has to be taken seriously.”
 Up to 20,000 spectators would be allowed by UEFA into Budapest’s Puskas Arena in a piloting project to test the return of fans into stadiums.
 However, Budapest’s mayor Gergely Karacsony wants the game played without fans.
 “If I had the legal means to decide that, I would let the game take place behind closed doors,” he told Hungarian newspaper Nepszava.
 The Hungarian FA (MLSZ) released a statement Wednesday saying the “Puskas Arena will be safer than any other place in the country”.
 The MLSZ pointed out that Sevilla and Bayern fans can only enter the stadium after “strict health checks”, will be kept seperate and “will not meet with Hungarian fans”.
 Rummenigge anticipates “less than a thousand” Bayern fans will actually make the journey and only around 500 Sevilla fans are expected.

The spokesman for the Pakistan Navy said on Wednesday that in his message on occasion, Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Zafar Mahmood Abbasi that shipping provides dependable connectivity and the most economical means of transporting goods: linking economies and communities across the globe.
 International economies are overwhelmingly dependent on shipping activity which carries nearly 90 per cent of global trade served by over 4,500 major ports worldwide, he says, adding that increasing traditional and non- traditional maritime security challenges as well as rising pollution levels are affecting the freedom of navigation and marine environment.
 “Owing to their magnitude and diversity, there is a growing realisation that no nation can tackle these challenges alone. It is thus a collective responsibility of all maritime nations to contribute and collaborate in countering maritime security challenges besides adopting international regulations and best practices for promoting an environment conducive for sustainable shipping industry.
 “Pakistan is blessed with an over 1,000km coastline. Sea trade is the backbone of our economy. Over 95% of our trade is through sea, yet Pakistani flag carriers carry around 16% of our total seaborne trade. As the CPEC and Gwadar Port are set in motion, maritime activities in Pakistan are bound to increase manifold.”
 According to the naval chief’s message, there is a need to capitalise on the associated economic opportunities which would only be possible by developing our maritime sector. In this regard, the declaration of 2020 as ‘The Year of Blue Economy’ by the GoP is a step in the right direction.
 “The Pakistan Navy, besides fulfilling its core responsibility of seaward defence, is leading the way to create maritime awareness in the country and promote Blue Economy. The Pakistan Navy is enhancing regional maritime security through continuous constructive engagements with international partners and by undertaking regional maritime security patrols.
 “The Coastal Security & Harbour Defence Force comprising a network of coastal security stations and a state of the art Joint Maritime Information and Coordination Centre at Karachi, duly supported by the Fleet, Pak Marines and SOF elements, are working day and night to ensure maritime security, maintain vigilance and respond to any emerging situation all along our coast.”
 He further says that the Pakistan Navy is laying special focus on reducing marine pollution and promoting safe and sustainable use of sea resources. Some of the major initiatives undertaken by the PN over the years include the construction of boats for the collection of solid waste in harbour, the establishment of sewage water treatment plants in all areas under its jurisdiction and refinement in SOPs to tackle oil pollution at sea.
 “The Pakistan Navy has also planted over 5 million mangrove saplings during the last three years along the coastal areas of Sindh and Balochistan to help protect marine ecosystems. “On this World Maritime Day, the Pakistan Navy pledges full support towards development of maritime sector in general and shipping industry in particular. We also reaffirm our commitment and resolve for the eradication of marine pollution for clean and green environment. I look forward to sincere efforts by all stakeholders to achieve sustainable development in Pakistan's maritime sector.”

The new MTG-B2000 watches further advance the Metal Core Guard Structure used in previous MT-G series watches by employing a new Dual Core Guard Structure that incorporates a carbon fiber-reinforced resin case, leveraging the light weight and rigidity of carbon fiber. The watch features a dual structure with a carbon monocoque case that seamlessly integrates the case and case back. This is surrounded by metal frame, giving the watch a refined metal look when viewed straight on and from the sides. This new structure achieved a watch with more visible metal while retaining the popular mid-sized case and weight that users found to be so wearable in the MTG-B1000 released in 2018. The MTG-B2000 watches also feature Triple G Resist to resist dropping shocks, centrifugal gravity, and vibration, ensuring toughness.

Un sistema messo a punto tenendo presente il no dei Visegrad, dei Baltici e dell'Austria ai ricollocamenti, ma che a ben guardare nella misura dei rimpatri sponsorizzati prevede che "se entro otto mesi non saranno stati effettuati tutti i rimpatri presi in carico, lo Stato partner che si e' impegnato nell'impresa sara' obbligato ad accogliere sul suo territorio quanti restano da allontanare", come ha spiegato la madrina della proposta, la commissaria svedese Ylva Johansson. Un dettaglio non di poco conto, di fronte al quale la Repubblica Ceca, per bocca del ministro dell'Interno Jan Hamacek, ha gia' levato gli scudi, col rifiuto netto di qualsiasi forma di ridistribuzione obbligatoria dei migranti.

The direction came on a petition against the dumping of sewage and industrial waste into the sea. The petitioners — World Wide Fund for Nature-Pakistan (WWF-Pakistan), Citizens for Better Environment (Shehri – CBE), Pakistan Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) and others —approached the high court seeking an injunction against release of industrial waste and untreated sewage into the sea.
 They submitted that Karachi was blessed with a coastline that had been attracting tourists, traders and fishermen for several decades. They expressed concerns over the actions and attitude of the metropolis’ civic agencies which were seriously harming the environment, specifically the city’s coastline.
 Two sewage and industrial waste dumps had been installed at Sea View which were polluting the sea, maintained the petitioners as they requested the SHC to order action against those responsible for the installation of the waste dumps in order to protect marine life and reduce health risks.
 The petitioners also attached in the application pictures taken both on-site and through Google Earth which clearly showed the sewage and industrial dumps installed at an approximate distance of 50 metres from the sea. The pictures also showed the open discharge of waste into the sea.
 It was further submitted in the petition that the flow of industrial waste and sewage into the sea was happening openly unconcealed and this, besides contaminating the sea, was causing the entire area to be enveloped by an unbearable stench. The petitioners maintained that it was an infringement of the fundamental rights of the citizens.
 They expressed the fear that such an untoward situation had been exposing the visitors of beach to serious health risks as sewage and industrial waste was causing various diseases and medical conditions. Besides, oral exposure to sewage-contaminated water could also give root to deadly diseases such as hepatitis, they stated.
 The petitioners’ counsel submitted that the acts and omissions of the civic agencies were not only destroying marine life and disturbing the ecological balance but their oversight was affecting the health of citizens who visited the beach for recreation.
 The counsels maintained that locals living near the beaches commonly found corpses of endangered green turtles and other cetaceans that had died due to water pollution. Referring to the pictures taken from Google Earth, the counsels brought the court’s attention towards the water around Sea View which appeared dirty and dark in colour; whereas, water around the beach at other coastal areas of Pakistan such as Gwadar looked blue and clear.
 The petitioners requested the SHC to direct the civic agencies to take steps for cleanliness of the beaches and ensure that sewage and industrial waste was not discharged into the sea.
 The SHC, on a previous hearing, had ordered the CBC and DHA to submit comments regarding the discharge of sewage and industrial water into the Arabian Sea near private restaurants. The CBC law officer submitted that building plans of private restaurants were not approved by the cantonment board; however, it seemed that the same had been approved by the DHA at their own.
 A division bench of the SHC headed by Justice Mohammad Shafi Siddiqui observed that the CBC lawyer did not file a report and sought time to do so. The high court observed that it appeared that no compliance had been made by the CBC and DHA with its previous order issued on October 22 last year.

Bryson’s breakthrough -
 Bryson DeChambeau dismantled one of golf’s most feared courses to win his maiden major title at the US Open, raising concerns about what he might do to Augusta when the Masters rolls around in November.
 DeChambeau, bulked-up from a regime of weight training and protein shakes during the coronavirus lockdown, brutalised Winged Foot with a singular strategy that upset the purists and prompted soul-searching among the golfing establishment.
 Tossing convention out of the window, the 27-year-old eschewed accuracy in favour of smashing his drives for pure distance — hitting just four of his last 21 fairways — and relying on his new-found strength to muscle recovery shots out of deep rough.
 Together with rock-solid putting, the result was a six-shot triumph, with DeChambeau the only player to shoot below par in the final round on Sunday.
 The fact that it came at a course famed for 1974’s “Massacre at Winged Foot” and the 2006 meltdowns of Phil Mickelson and Colin Montgomerie — when Geoff Ogilvy won with a five-over-par total — underlined the feeling that this could be a game-changer.
 “I don’t really know what to say because that’s just the complete opposite of what you think a US Open champion does,” said a flabbergasted Rory McIlroy, a four-time major winner.
 DeChambeau, a physics major, has long prided himself on the analytical approach that has earned him the nickname ‘Mad Scientist’.
 He’s known for cutting his irons and wedges to the same length, floating his balls in Epsom salt to discover their lighter and heavier sides, and even writing backwards and left-handed to improve his fine motor skills.
 For the Masters, Dechambeau, dubbed the ‘Incredible Bulk’ since his physical transformation, is planning to add another 10 pounds (five kilos) of muscle and is considering using an outsized, 48-inch driver.
 The danger for the sport’s hierarchy is that DeChambeau repeats his success at Augusta, which suits long hitters and has little rough, forcing them to change the rules or equipment to stop golf turning into a driving contest.
 But DeChambeau warned: “It’s tough to rein in athleticism. We’re always going to be trying to get fitter, stronger, more athletic.
 “Tiger (Woods) inspired this whole generation to do this and we’re going to keep going after it. I don’t think it’s going to stop.”
 \- Six of the worst -
 While DeChambeau was turning heads at Winged Foot, New Zealand’s Danny Lee was losing his.
 After an increasingly irate six-putt on the final hole of his third round, Lee slammed his putter into his bag and hurled it into the turf, before withdrawing with a wrist injury.
 “The most likely cause for a sore wrist would have been the 30-year-old smashing his putter into his bag as he stormed off the green,” quipped New Zealand’s Stuff website.
 Lee’s quintuple bogey left him 13 over for the tournament — no disgrace on a course that has been the undoing of many a player — but it was his fit of pique that drew negative attention.

There are - perhaps surprisingly - lots of young, healthy people ready to volunteer for coronavirus challenge trials.
 It would be a way of finding out, almost immediately, whether a vaccine works.
 And it could help speed the selection of the promising coronavirus vaccines.
 The health of the volunteers would be monitored round the clock at a clinical research facility in London.
 I understand that no contracts for the study, which would be government funded, have yet been signed, but the hope is they could begin in January.
 What's been holding things up are ethical considerations - challenge studies have been used to test vaccines for flu, cholera and typhoid, but in each case there was an effective treatment to prevent volunteers from falling ill.
 With coronavirus, there would be an added level of risk - but it's one that volunteers say they are willing to take.

“There are a lot of people who tell me it’s their first time dining out since February,” said hostess Emma Kanell, who started working at LaRosa’s a month ago amidst the pandemic.
 Shift supervisor Brendan Hart, more familiar with the restaurant’s customer trends over the last four years, said he has been hopeful after a rebound in business spanning several weeks.
 “We’re seating every other table inside and 30 or more seats outside with heaters,” he said.
 “I know the owner is trying to figure out how to stretch the outdoor dining. I’ve heard talk of foil blankets at every table, like you see people wrap themselves in at the end of marathons.”
 Similarly, nearby at Salvatore’s, the third side of a large tent setup in the parking lot is expected this week. What started as an overhead covering will become enclosed as the weather gets colder, and eventually, heaters will be added.
 “This is all new. So we’re going to be trying out different types to see what works best, what’s the most efficient,” said General Manager Kevin Branco.
 The purchase of a new igloo-type structure will hopefully be a fun draw for customers as well, he said.
 “It’s one of those clear, plastic, see-through structures like they have in Boston,” he said. “We’re trying to figure out different ways to make it fun and functional for people to keep dining outside.”
 Inside, dividers are being ordered for a renovation and redesign that has been in the works longer than the pandemic. The plastic partitions are expected to allow for about 110 people indoors.
 “We’ve got a new name, new menu, new everything coming at the beginning of October,” Branco said. “This just adds more planning, but we’re happy to see regulars and new customers who are supporting us through it.”
 While top management grapples with logistics, diners just seem happy to be out now.
 Hart said of LaRosa’s, “There’s an energy back here that was missing for a while during quarantine.”

LAKE CHARLES, La. (KPLC) - The St. Nicholas Center for Children in Lake Charles has been helping kids with autism since 2008, but after the center was damaged during Hurricane Laura, those children have gone without therapy now for a month.The outside of the St. Nicholas Center for Children almost appears to be untouched. However, 95 percent of the inside of the building including their technology, therapy materials and furniture are a total loss.“We looked at our building, and we’re like, this is great, there’s not much damage,” Outreach Director Tausha Kordisch said. “What we couldn’t see from standing on the ground were the holes riddled across the roof and the sections of roof that were actually missing.”Kordisch said the entire inside of the center is environmentally unfit for anyone to be inside of it right now.The damaged building leaves many autistic children without a safe space to learn and have fun.Kordisch knows first-hand how difficult this can be on the kids and their families.“It’s very difficult for a family with children who have autism to be displaced and not have their regular therapies happening,” Kordisch said. “What you need to understand is children with autism, they crave structure and routine, and that’s been taken away.”That’s why the staff is working tirelessly to rebuild the center and offer a temporary solution.“We were blessed by Dr. Casci. He has donated a piece of property that we can use temporarily to put temporary sites on so that our children can start coming to therapy.”The temporary location will have classroom learning pods so kids can attend therapy. The staff hopes to have that up and running in just a few short weeks.For the time being, they want families to know they are here for them.“You have a family of people to help support you and help make it through together,” Kordisch said. “So, we’ll be here, and we’ll be together very soon.”Copyright 2020 KPLC.

Middle linebacker and defensive captain Bobby Wagner said no Wednesday when he talked to media members via Zoom.
 “I don't think it's a concern,’’ said Wagner. “I think it is definitely an area that we can improve on.’’
 Then Wagner explained why he's not yet worried, noting it’s just two games and that Seattle has been much better against the run this year than last season.
 “We’ve been very stout on the run, kind of forcing teams to pass the ball,’’ Wagner said.
 Indeed, Seattle is third best in the NFL in allowing just 3.0 yards per carry, a vast improvement from the 4.9 of last year (and they allowed minus-1 yard rushing on the key play to date of the season on the final snap Sunday against the Patriots.)
 That, at least, gets the Seahawks back on track in coach Pete Carroll’s No. 1 defensive objective: stopping the run.

North Texas’ game at Houston on Saturday has been canceled due to a coronavirus outbreak at UNT.
 The schools made the announcement Wednesday afternoon.
 UNT is dealing with four active coronavirus cases across its entire athletics department following its last round of testing conducted last week. School officials have not disclosed if the people who have tested positive are athletes, coaches or administrators.
 UNT officials said Wednesday that the four people who have tested positive are in isolation and their contacts have been identified. The fallout from contact tracing will prevent the Mean Green from playing this week.
 “We knew that there would be challenges with COVID-19 this season and we were taking precautions to hopefully avoid this situation,” UNT athletic director Wren Baker said in a statement. “Our student-athlete health and safety is the priority in every decision we make and that is what this difficult decision is based on. We are hopeful we can resume safe activities soon.”
 Despite both schools announcing the game is canceled, UNT said they are working to find a date to reschedule the game.
 The game is the second UNT has lost to the pandemic. The Mean Green were scheduled to play at Texas A&M on Sept. 12. That game was lost when the SEC elected to move to a 10-game conference-only schedule.
 UNT has played two games so far this season. The Mean Green beat Houston Baptist in their season opener before falling to SMU last weekend.
 School officials acknowledged before UNT’s game against SMU that linebackers KD Davis and Tyreke Davis would not play against the Mustangs due to medical reasons. UNT coach Seth Littrell declined to provide additional details after the game.
 UNT athletic department officials formulated a plan to deal with the pandemic after the school shut down its campus in March. The plan was based on testing and social distancing.
 Conference USA later adopted standards for its schools that includes testing football players for COIVD-19 three times per week.
 UNT officials expressed confidence in their plan before the school’s football players began reporting back to campus in June. Littrell has consistently praised the school’s administration and his players for the way they have handled the pandemic.
 “Our testing has been unbelievable,” Littrell said earlier this fall. “Our players have done a great job of staying in our bubble and doing the things that are necessary for us to play ball.”
 The school has held down the number of infections it has experienced since its athletes began returning to campus but has had a steady trickle of infections over the last few weeks.
 UNT has had 26 members of the department recover from an infection. The school had conducted 3,442 total tests as of Monday.
 Houston has not played a game this season. The Cougars were set to face Baylor last week in a game the schools added to their schedule earlier this fall.
 Baylor canceled the game due to COVID-19-related issues. Houston has now had five games either canceled or postponed, a list that also includes games against Rice, Washington State and Memphis.
 “We understand this COVID-related decision North Texas has made to not play Saturday’s game and appreciate the consistent dialogue with our program by UNT Athletics Director Wren Baker, his administration and medical staff during this week,” Houston athletic director Chris Pezman said in a statement. “I am disappointed for our student-athletes who have continued to focus on competing this season and were ready to play this Saturday. We will continue to work to adjust our schedule with the hopes of playing as soon as we can.”
 UNT will now turn its attention to its Conference USA opener. The Mean Green are scheduled to host Southern Miss on Oct. 3 at Apogee Stadium.

JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - What will be the state’s next flag? A lot of votes and steps have already been taken. But the next step is at the polls.Think of the In God We Trust flag as the candidate and Mississippi’s business leaders are now working to organize a campaign of sorts.“Making sure people understand that, ‘Hey, the vote is on November 3 and this particular event is at the very bottom of the ballot,’" said Mississippi Economic Council President and CEO Scott Waller. "There’s a lot of other things on the ballot above it but get to the bottom of ballot and cast your vote.”The Mississippi Economic Council and Alliance for Mississippi’s Future are teaming up for the campaign. They’ve created ingodwetrustflag.com where people can learn more about the design and make a donation to the campaign to receive items like a yard sign, car tag, decal or face maks. They’ve studied the topic for years now and believe it’s important folks know what’s at stake.“I think the future really lies in getting this symbol flying so that represents Mississippi in a symbol that will let other businesses know that look, this is a new day, a new opportunity in citizens of Mississippi are ready and welcoming to start moving forward," added Waller.A prototype is flying outside the Old Capitol Museum but you likely haven’t seen it elsewhere yet. Here’s why.“Production time normally for flags is around two weeks," explained Brenda McIntyre. "That’s digital print of flags that we can get made all the time. But this was going to be thousands of flags we were going to have made so we worked with a company that we do business with all the time and they said that they could get things done for us in about 2 1/2 to 3 weeks which we thought was incredibly good.”Brenda McIntyre co-owns A Complete Flag Source with her husband Jim. Those orders are expected to start coming in this week and next. But a scan around the store and you’ll see another familiar flag.“The retired flag, the old 1894 Mississippi flag, we still have in stock and we will always have it in stock because it is now a historical flag,” described Jim McIntyre.And some are ready to see this flag fly where it once did. The Legislature will have the ultimate say, even if the design gets the majority approval in the November vote.If you’re wondering about the proposal that would put a few different options on the ballot... that won’t be this ballot. A group is in the process of collecting signatures to get four different flags, including the 1894 flag, on a ballot in the future.Copyright 2020 WLBT. All rights reserved.

President Trump keen to pass the buck as America’s Covid-19 deaths pass 200,000

Local organizers have been gearing up for what may be the final push to get as many local residents registered for the 2020 Census.
 As of Wednesday, the deadline to complete the census has been set for Sept. 30 by the President Trump administration, according to Cindy Quezada, senior program officer at the Center at Sierra Health Foundation. Quezada — who has been at the heart of this year’s census registration efforts throughout the county — said the deadline was moved from Oct. 31 back to the end of this month to ensure the results would be ready by Dec. 31.
 Quezada said an existing lawsuit could reverse the date back to Oct. 31 once again, but as of Wednesday the 2020 Census deadline remained just seven days away.
 Since learning of the deadline’s change in early August, Quezada said her organization has been in an “emergency type of mode” to try and get as many residents — especially those considered “hard to count” — on board with the census.
 Currently, Kern County has recorded a 63.1 self response rate during this year’s census, according to Louis Medina, director of community impact at the Kern Community Foundation.
 Quezada said that in 2010, there was a 65.2 self response rate throughout the county.
 “Considering all of the setbacks with COVID and a lot of the debate over whether or not the census should count undoucmented people — considering all of that — the fact that we’re at 63 percent, it’s not that bad,” Medina said.
 Quezada described this year’s census efforts as being “wild” and “challenging.” Other factors that have caused difficulties outside of the pandemic have included the poor air quality as a result of wildfires which has prevented census canvassers from going door-to-door, Quezada said.
 She explained that many of the communities that have been considered “hard to count” have included many rural communities and parts of east Bakersfield. Some of the communities with low self response rates include Lost Hills, Maricopa and Taft, she said.
 “Many of the people (in these hard-to-count communities) are immigrants, people of color, low income, people with low educational attainment,” Quezada said.
 She said that in order to try to at least match 2010’s self response rate, canvassing would be needed at 113,200 households.
 With all of the roadblocks they have encountered throughout the year, census canvassers have had to get creative, Quezada said.
 In many of the “hard to count” communities, organizers have implemented a caravan of cars making noise to get people to come outside. Canvassers also recently added a DJ to the caravan, which she said has been “very successful.”
 “In certain areas, it's really hard to canvas, there’s a ton of dogs, locked gates, sometimes in high crime areas,” Quezada said. “There’s obstacles to coming to the door, so they’ve adapted to try to find approaches to getting people’s attention.”
 Other methods that have been implemented have included a group that works with the local Sikh community to try and get their message across to the monolingual Sikh population. They have also had groups accompany Spanish- language radio stations out at the fields for local harvests.
 They've even gone the route of creating jingles and songs in various languages. Quezada said their songs have varied from mariachi, to Punjabi, to even a trilingual rap in Spanish, English and the indigenous language of Mixtec.
 “They’re all really catchy songs,” Quezada said. “There’s one in Spanish that is about the telephone number (related to) the census. It was only because of that song that I remembered that number. After this song, it’s in me now. I can’t forget it now.”
 Medina explained that for every person that is left uncounted, Kern County loses about $20,000 and could potentially lose government representation.
 "I encourage everyone to visit the website 2020census.gov because you can respond to the census on that website," Medina said. "People can respond by phone too, in different languages. The census bureau has made it really easy to respond."
 Medina said that phone numbers available for the census are 844-330-2020 for English speakers, and 844-468-2020 for Spanish.

“The journalists and workers of the Geo-Jang Group were fighting the cause of the freedom of the media in the country as never in the past such restrictions on the media were imposed by the rulers,” the protestors said at the protest camp outside the offices of Jang and The News in Rawalpindi on Wednesday.
 At the protest camp that has been continuing for the last 194 days against the illegal arrest of Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman, the protesters chanted slogans and raised slogans.
 Addressing the protestors, Secretary General Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists Nasir Zaidi said the workers of Geo and Jang Group were writing a new leaf of history for the struggle for the freedom of the media in the country.
 Chairman Joint Action Committee of the workers of Geo and Jang Group and President Jang Workers Union Rawalpindi Nasir Chisti said of the workers of Geo and Jang group stood with Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman for his principled stance for the freedom of the media in the country.
 Resident Editor The News Aamir Ghauri said the workers of Geo and Jang have succeeded in their movement for the freedom of media in the country. He said the movement of Geo and Jang Group was yielding the positive results in the struggle for the freedom of media in the country.
 Resident Editor Jang Rawalpindi Hanif Khalid said those who dreamt of dictating Jang and The News on their terms were failed as of Mir Shakil-ur- Rahman made it clear that he will not compromise on his principles stance of the freedom of the media in the country.
 Secretary General Rawalpindi Islamabad Union of Journalists and senior correspondent of Geo News Islamabad Asif Ali Bhatti said that workers of Geo and Jang Group did not stand up only for their media group but also for all the media to ensure their right of freedom of media in the country.
 Chief Reporter Jang Rawalpindi Jang Rawalpindi Rana Ghulam Qadir said that rulers should learn from the history that they could move forward without ensuring the freedom of the media in the country.
 He said it was credit of Editor-in-Chief of Geo and Jang Group Mir Shakil-ur- Rahman that now everyone demanded the freedom of the media and freedom of expression in the country. The workers of Jang Group Amjad Abbasi, Munir Shah, Nusrat Malik, Azhar Sultan, Naseerul Haq, Kamal Shah and other workers of Jang and The News vowed to foil all the conspiracies against the Geo and Jang Group.
 In Lahore, journalists, civil society members, office-bearers of media unions and trade union of Jang Group on Wednesday condemned the arrest of Jang/Geo Editor-in-Chief Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman for the last 194 days over a 35-year old property exchange matter without giving any proof of charges or making any progress in investigations.
 Staging a demonstration outside Jang offices at a protest camp of the workers of Geo, Jang and The News employees for the 172nd consecutive day, they criticized Prime Minister Imran Khan for working exactly opposite to his tall claims of over 20 years to turn Pakistan into a Madina-like state, which he used only to woo media support to come into power. But, actually, Imran Khan has been victimizing Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman for exposing the corruption and bad governance of the PTI government, they said, adding that there was neither any progress in investigations into the corruption charges of 35 years old property exchange case against him nor any formal case was registered. The participants termed it a blatant attack on media freedom, chanted slogans against the fascist PTI regime and condemned the illegal and anti-media tactics of the NAB.
 Wahab Mirza said media cannot work for the truth without freedom as it plays the role of a watchdog for the society and country. He noted that such victimizations were forced by dictators like Gen Ayub Khan, Gen Ziaul Haq, Gen Pervez Musharraf in the past and now media workers are being victimized by Imran Khan who was selected by the establishment to curb media. He said the whole world knew the truth that Imran Khan was selected in sham elections and is now proving that he is not the representative of the masses and democracy.
 Awais Qarni said victimization of Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman must come to an end after the detention of over five months, and he should be released as his arrest is a symbolic move to usurp media freedom. Already the results desired by the rulers are coming out and the arrest is leading towards crumbling of other media houses and closure of noted news channels and retrenchment of workers in others recently.
 Farooq Awan said the fabricated case against Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman should be withdrawn and he should be released. He warned if Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman is not released, the protest would increase creating more problems for the government. He said the government instead of providing relief to people from the economic crunch is busy curbing the voice of media and victimizing media owners. He said the Jang Group always reported truth. He said the PTI government is using all pressure tactics to subdue the press and the Jang Group is bearing the brunt being the largest media house in the country.
 In Peshawar, the members of the journalist community on Wednesday demanded the release of Jang/Geo Group Editor-in-Chief Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman.
 The protesters converged on the offices of Daily Jang, The News and Geo TV to register their anger. They raised slogans against the arrest of Mir Shakil-ur- Rahman and in support of press freedom.
 The protesters demanded the release of Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman who was arrested on March 12 and had been interned since then.
 Jang Resident Editor Arshad Aziz Malik, Gohar Ali, Qaiser Khan, Ehtesham Toru, Amjad Safi, Rasool Dawar, Sardar Imdad Ali Qazalbash, Rahamdil and others criticised the government and the NAB for arresting Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman on cooked-up charges and keeping him behind bars for the last 196 days.
 The protesters said the Jang Group chief had been arrested to pressurise the free media and bully others to force them to accept official dictates. The speakers said that the NAB had failed to take any action against the PTI members who were allegedly involved in corrupt practices.
 The protesters deplored the lack of action by the NAB over wheat flour, sugar crises, Malam Jabba land, Billion Tree Tsunami and Bus Rapid Transit scandals. They requested the apex court to take notice of the case and provide justice to Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman.

transparent such that [the ACLU] doesn't have to file a lawsuit to get what is the public's data."
 The sparring between the ACLU and Adel over access to information isn't over. As part of their original public records request, the ACLU asked for voting history of a committee that makes recommendations to the county attorney on whether to seek the death penalty. Adel's office is still withholding those records, so the issue is headed to an oral argument at the end of October, Ortiz said.
 During a previous oral argument back in March concerning the ACLU's record request lawsuit, an arbitrator asked an attorney representing Adel's office about the committee voting records and the public's right to see them.
 "Maricopa County Attorney's Office is an elected position. Every four years one or two or three or more people run for that position. I as a voter am charged with the decision of whom to vote for," the arbitrator said, according to a transcript of the hearing. "Don't you think a voter would like to know if the incumbent County Attorney that's running for reelection ... voted to pursue a death penalty even though the committee didn't support that? Don't you think a voter would want to know that?"
 In response, Ann Uglietta, Adel's attorney, said, "It doesn't matter if the voter would want to know that. It's still protected information."
 ## Policy Differences
 On several key criminal justice reform issues, Gunnigle and Adel are miles apart.
 For instance, on bail bonds, which critics argue unfairly keep poor defendants locked up while their cases move through the courts, Gunnigle told _New Times_ that she is making a "commitment" to adopt a policy for her prosecutors to not ask judges to impose bail bonds on defendants in any context.
 "It is the commitment to not ask for cash bail at all," she said. "People shouldn't be in jail for no other reason than they don't have a couple hundred bucks or thousands of dollars that they need to bail out."
 When pressed on her position, Gunnigle clarified that her office would still ask judges to detain defendants who are ineligible for release through bail bonds as outlined in statute, court rules, and the Arizona state constitution. (Defendants charged with capital offenses or sexual assault are ineligible for bail, as are people charged with felony offenses that pose a substantial danger to the public.)
 "When I make more generalized statements of 'We're not going to ask for cash bail,' it's, 'We're not going to be asking for cash bail in those instances where we could ask for cash bail,'" Gunnigle said.
 Regarding her stance on bail bonds, Adel pointed to provisions in statute and the state constitution allowing for them. She argued that judges have the ultimate authority over dictating defendants' conditions of release, and disputed the notion that prosecutors ask for unreasonable bail bonds for defendants accused of low-level crimes.
 "The reason for asking for a secured appearance bond is not punitive. We do not want a debtors' jail -- we want people to be back and working while they're waiting the resolution of their case," Adel said. "Bond is there to secure appearance, to protect victims and public safety. And with an eye towards that, we look to a secured appearance bond that is appropriate for that person and their [criminal] history."
 "There have been occasions when we have asked for secured appearance because that's the appropriate thing to do, but then the judge sets a cash bond," she added. "We're there to do what is right and follow the law and make a recommendation that is not overly onerous on the person but again, protects public safety and victims."
 Then there's police accountability. Since the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in late May, Phoenix has seen regular protests over police brutality, one of the nation's highest levels of police shootings,  and subsequent calls for prosecuting the involved cops.
 Gunnigle said that she would establish an "independent" unit of prosecutors removed from day-to-day case work and subject-matter experts who could review incidents of alleged police misconduct for criminal liability, and ultimately conduct prosecutions of officers. She argued that the office's regular criminal attorneys are too cozy with law enforcement to impartially investigate them.
 "We need an independent and community-involved unit that can prosecute police use-of-force cases," she said, adding that she's seen prosecutors develop relationships with officers and considers it "a conflict of interest."
 When asked how this new unit would be impartial when its hypothetical boss, Gunnigle, would still have to maintain working relationships with law enforcement due to the office's routine criminal prosecution operations, Gunnigle pointed to her personal convictions and the fact that the Phoenix Law Enforcement Association (PLEA), the union for rank-and-file Phoenix cops, has endorsed Adel in the race.
 "Right now, our current unelected county attorney is the PLEA-endorsed candidate," Gunnigle said. "It's good government to be separated from police and make sure that this office does not have the reputation of being the law firm for police departments."

She jumps out someone who I didn't recognize or get a good look at. Raven(?) gets eliminated next. Rhea launches out someone else who never gets TV time and it was rough. Brandi Lauren gets sent out by Raquel. Rhea also gets out another rookie who barely gets shown. The same goes for Raquel. She and Rhea are dominating. Like in the 2019 Royal Rumble. Kacy Catanzaro gets tossed but her feet never touch the flow. She rolls into a handstand and gets her feet under the bottom rope to pull herself back inside before a commercial. During the break, Robert Stone tries to save Aliyah from elimination but Rhea still knocks her out. I may have missed an elimination or two. Returning, Kacy is knocked off the apron and into the guardrail. She latches on and climbs onto the plexiglass. She leaps back onto the stairs and Indi Hartwell kicks her off but she gets back to the guardrail. Kayden Carter on the apron tries to help but is eliminated. She then helps Kacy get back in the ring. Rhea and Raquel now go at it. Raquel gets her on her shoulders and they fall over the top and both get eliminated. We're down to Dakota, Candice, Indi, Shotzi, and Kacy. Kacy dumps Indi and then Dakota attacks. She and Candice work together to eliminate Kacy and then work on Shotzi. Blackheart turns it on them and dumps Dakota. She goes to toss Candice, who latches onto the ropes. They go at it and both come close to getting eliminated. Candice ends up on the steps and Shotzi uses her boot to try and get rid of her. Candice ends up on her back and boots Shotzi to the floor to win.

Detroit moved to a midtown trailer park called the Aristocrat and joined a local S&M club.
 "I've got this foot fetish thing going on," he explains. "So I was real popular at the club because the dominatrices didn't have anyone to do feet for them. I had appointments as soon as I joined, and I was with them until 2010. I've been into the BDSM lifestyle since I was a teenager. I don't believe in regular relationships. I believe in role playing."
 "He loves women's toes," B-movie actress Brenda Fogarty shrugs. "Okay. Whatever. With Eddy, it's never anything ordinary. And at least he's upfront about the toe thing."
 Fogarty stars in Detroit's favorite movie of all time, _Trip With the Teacher_ , a schlocky 1975 crime thriller about a bunch of scantily clad schoolgirls terrorized on a desert field trip.
 "It's a cute little B film," according to Fogarty, who plays the title role. "It was made on a shoestring, but it has a big cult following. It's especially big in Guam."
 Meeting Eddy Detroit means hearing all about _Trip With the Teacher_. He counts among his greatest accomplishments the fact that he has befriended the surviving cast and author of the film, and appears in the commentaries on the recent DVD reissue. He reads the actors' tarot cards over the phone every weekend and loves the movie so much he organized a reunion of the cast and director Earl Barton.
 "He brought us all little bitty Oscars," giggles Ousley, who plays one of the film's beleaguered teens. She's since left acting and co-founded a high- definition makeup company. "We were at this strange little club, the Pig 'n' Whistle in Hollywood, and Eddy played bongos and Brenda did some of her monologues. It was the sweetest thing. And we were surprised he had time to even come out here, because he's always got a show someplace."
 Detroit has kept a hectic musical pace well into the 21st century -- playing solo gigs at the Mason Jar, performing as a duo with folkie Mishy Katz, and traveling to the U.K. to headline the international TUSK Festival in 2016.
 "They flew me out there," he says of that last gig, sounding delighted. "They even paid for my food. Am I Taylor Swift or something?"
 While he was out that way, Detroit figured he'd better do a European tour. "I played African music at the Cafe OTO in London. In Paris, I had a loft apartment. In Rotterdam, the promoter handed me a big chunk of hash, on the house. Geneva, Antwerp, Belgium, every place I played, someone was nice to me. We sold out eight shows in five countries. One place, the producer greeted me with six pizzas!"
 Back home, Detroit founded a jazz trio with a couple of 20-somethings he met at a local festival. "St. Jude got that one for me," he explains, citing the Catholic patron saint of desperate situations. "He came to me in a dream and said I would be playing jazz music."
 Guitarist Nicky Dewberry heard about that dream the very next day. "I was playing a festival and Eddy was sitting there with his bongos and the first thing he said was, 'Do you know any horn players? I had a dream last night. Let's start a jazz band.' We had our first rehearsal that week and then we played the Clarendon Hotel for two years straight."
 Before COVID-19, Detroit was still regularly playing acoustic punk gigs around town, opening for Fat Gray Cat at Crescent Ballroom and performing with Kembra Pfahler of glam-punk band The Voluptuous Horror of Karen Black. "I'm a big fan of hers," Detroit says. "She's a foot dominatrix in New York, and she let me do a foot scene with her at the Mason Jar."

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Wednesday said a plan by the Food and Drug Administration to issue tough new standards for emergency approval of a coronavirus vaccine "sounds like a political move" and warned that the White House might reject it.
 Trump said he had "tremendous trust in these massive companies" developing prospective vaccines and suggested that they, not federal regulators, could best determine when a vaccine should be made available to the American people. "When you have great companies coming up with these vaccines, why would they [the FDA] have to be, you know, adding great length to the process? We want to have people not get sick."
 "I don't see why it should be delayed further," he said. "That is a lot of lives you're talking about."
 His comments raised questions about the integrity of the vaccine approval process on the same day that four top administration health officials, including FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, in a Senate hearing, tried to reassure the public that any vaccine decision would be free of political interference and based strictly on data reviewed by FDA career scientists.
 Trump suggested that the vaccine makers were getting good results in their late-stage trials. In fact, the trials have not produced any results — it's too early. The White House, the FDA and the companies do not know yet whether the vaccines work.
 Trump has been predicting for months that a vaccine could be available before Election Day. The proposed FDA standards, if implemented, would make that highly unlikely, according to two people familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss information before it is made public. More likely, vaccines would be cleared in mid- to late November or December, or even later.

 Harkin, 80, who was a member of the Health, Education, Welfare and Labor Committee for the 30 years he represented Iowa in the Senate, predicted that with Biden as president, regardless of which party controls the Senate, Congress will approve a public option — a government-run health insurance agency to compete with private insurers.

 Secretary General Rawalpindi Islamabad Union of Journalists and senior correspondent of Geo News Islamabad Asif Ali Bhatti said that workers of Geo and Jang Group did not stand up only for their media group but also for all the media to ensure their right of freedom of media in the country.
 Chief Reporter Jang Rawalpindi Jang Rawalpindi Rana Ghulam Qadir said that rulers should learn from the history that they could move forward without ensuring the freedom of the media in the country.
 He said it was credit of Editor-in-Chief of Geo and Jang Group Mir Shakil-ur- Rahman that now everyone demanded the freedom of the media and freedom of expression in the country.
 The workers of Jang Group Amjad Abbasi, Munir Shah, Nusrat Malik, Azhar Sultan, Naseerul Haq, Kamal Shah and other workers of Jang and The News vowed to foil all the conspiracies against the Geo and Jang Group.
 In Lahore, journalists, civil society members, office-bearers of media unions and trade union of Jang Group on Wednesday condemned the arrest of Jang/Geo Editor-in-Chief Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman for the last 194 days over a 35-year old property exchange matter without giving any proof of charges or making any progress in investigations.
 Staging a demonstration outside Jang offices at a protest camp of the workers of Geo, Jang and The News employees for the 172nd consecutive day, they criticized Prime Minister Imran Khan for working exactly opposite to his tall claims of over 20 years to turn Pakistan into a Madina-like state, which he used only to woo media support to come into power. But, actually, Imran Khan has been victimizing Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman for exposing the corruption and bad governance of the PTI government, they said, adding that there was neither any progress in investigations into the corruption charges of 35 years old property exchange case against him nor any formal case was registered. The participants termed it a blatant attack on media freedom, chanted slogans against the fascist PTI regime and condemned the illegal and anti-media tactics of the NAB.
 Wahab Mirza said media cannot work for the truth without freedom as it plays the role of a watchdog for the society and country. He noted that such victimizations were forced by dictators like Gen Ayub Khan, Gen Ziaul Haq, Gen Pervez Musharraf in the past and now media workers are being victimized by Imran Khan who was selected by the establishment to curb media. He said the whole world knew the truth that Imran Khan was selected in sham elections and is now proving that he is not the representative of the masses and democracy.
 Awais Qarni said victimization of Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman must come to an end after the detention of over five months, and he should be released as his arrest is a symbolic move to usurp media freedom. Already the results desired by the rulers are coming out and the arrest is leading towards crumbling of other media houses and closure of noted news channels and retrenchment of workers in others recently.
 Farooq Awan said the fabricated case against Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman should be withdrawn and he should be released. He warned if Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman is not released, the protest would increase creating more problems for the government. He said the government instead of providing relief to people from the economic crunch is busy curbing the voice of media and victimizing media owners. He said the Jang Group always reported truth. He said the PTI government is using all pressure tactics to subdue the press and the Jang Group is bearing the brunt being the largest media house in the country.
 In Peshawar, the members of the journalist community on Wednesday demanded the release of Jang/Geo Group Editor-in-Chief Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman.
 The protesters converged on the offices of Daily Jang, The News and Geo TV to register their anger.
 They raised slogans against the arrest of Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman and in support of press freedom.
 The protesters demanded the release of Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman who was arrested on March 12 and had been interned since then.
 Jang Resident Editor Arshad Aziz Malik, Gohar Ali, Qaiser Khan, Ehtesham Toru, Amjad Safi, Rasool Dawar, Sardar Imdad Ali Qazalbash, Rahamdil and others criticised the government and the NAB for arresting Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman on cooked-up charges and keeping him behind bars for the last 196 days.
 The protesters said the Jang Group chief had been arrested to pressurise the free media and bully others to force them to accept official dictates.
 The speakers said that the NAB had failed to take any action against the PTI members who were allegedly involved in corrupt practices.
 The protesters deplored the lack of action by the NAB over wheat flour, sugar crises, Malam Jabba land, Billion Tree Tsunami and Bus Rapid Transit scandals.
 They requested the apex court to take notice of the case and provide justice to Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman.

Badger’s boys soccer team started the season strong, winning its first two games.
 First up was a road match Sept. 17 against Westosha Central, which the Badgers won 3-1.
 Westosha got on the board first, as Nolan Bruni scored in the 26th minute. And the Falcons were able to hold that lead for the next 45 minutes, leading 1-0 with 20 minutes remaining in the contest.
 The Badgers kicked it into overdrive after that, though, scoring three straight.
 First up was a goal by Joel Torres in the 71st minute. Henry Blay picked up an assist on the play. When Badger scored three minutes later off the foot of Zion Walker, Blay was involved again, picking up his second assist of the contest to help give Badger the lead.

Punjab Industrial Estates Development and Management Company Chairman Nabeel Hashmi briefed the meeting regarding development work and industrialisation. Addressing the meeting, the provincial minister directed the officials concerned to accelerate development work and asked to contact the federal government for the resolution of electricity, Sui gas and other problems of industrial estates. He said that steps should be taken to identify and resolve the issues with the consultation of stakeholders.
 The Punjab government is working on setting up of 13 special economic zones (SEZs) which will change the destiny of the country, he said adding that billions of rupees investment was coming through industrialisation.
 The minister said Quaid-i-Azam Business Park was a milestone for industrial development. He said that the government was setting up industrial estates on thousands of acres in Southern Punjab which would bring economic revolution in the region. He directed PIEDMC to work actively for the completion of development work in industrial estates. Punjab Board of Investment director, CEO PIEDMC, and industries department officers attended the meeting.
 PGMI: PGMI Principal Prof Al-freed Zafar and PINS Executive Director Prof Dr Khalid Mahmood have said doctors should record their memoirs and make them available to medical educational institutes and laboratories so that newcomers in the field of medical administration may be able to use their long experience to run the institutes in best possible way. They were talking to the participants of a reception organised in honour of LGH management.

The FDA's plan is part of an effort by the agency to increase transparency and build public trust in the vaccine — something that has been difficult given the White House's repeated interfering with government health agencies. But Trump said late Wednesday that the plan "has to be approved by the White House. We may or may not approve it."
 During the hearing before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, top health officials sought to dispel accusations that the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic is being driven by politics, with each official saying he would trust a vaccine enough to take it himself.
 Hahn said the decision on whether a vaccine is safe and effective will be made by the agency's career scientists, following "the science and data and our rigorous standards."
 "FDA will not permit any pressure from anyone to change that," he said.
 Hahn said he could not predict when the companies developing the vaccine candidates that are furthest along in clinical trials would be ready to apply for federal clearance — or how long that FDA assessment might take.
 "What I can tell you is, we do feel the urgency of the moment," he said. "We will not delay, but we will not cut corners."

Sanju Samson's big hitting--nine sixes in a 32-ball 74 on Tuesday--was the key reason why MS Dhoni's Chennai Super Kings were left flailing while chasing what would have been the highest IPL target ever achieved."Sanju played an unbelievable knock. Felt like everything he was hitting went for six. I was just giving Sanju strike, wasn't I? He was middling everything. I hope this sets him up for a big IPL," Rajasthan Royals skipper Steve Smith gushed after a 16-run win followed the 216/7 his team raised on being asked to bat first in Sharjah.Dhoni is the inspiration for the new generation of wicketkeeper-batsmen and he was at hand to watch Samson unleash his shots. IPL brings the best out of Samson, whose season-best tally of 441 came for RR in 2018 and 342 with a century last season. The 25-year-old Kerala player's first-class career though has been modest since his debut in 2011 (55 games, 3,162 runs, avg 37.64, 10x100).Samson started playing top- level cricket at a very young age. Under Rahul Dravid's captaincy in RR, the 18-year-old was hailed as a find in 2013 on his IPL debut. He was marked for a bigger stage but lost his way in domestic cricket, attributed to a slump in form and poor temperament. He strove hard and returned to the India fold when he was picked to play in the T20 series in New Zealand early this year. With Dhoni's international retirement, Samson is among those chasing a spot in the India limited-overs teams.In this interview after Tuesday's match-winning knock and four victims with the gloves, Samson talks about his effortless hitting, hopes for a regular India spot, the Dhoni comparison young wicketkeepers face and chances this year for the 2008 champions.ExcerptsHow did you plan your innings, especially when hitting those sixes?I had the intent right from the start. Even early on when I faced the pacers, I was looking to score, put the bad balls away. I had to adapt to the pitch; it was a bit slow, the ball was not exactly coming on when pitched in the good length area. I decided to wait for balls pitched in my area to hit those shots. When the spinners came on, I was lucky the lengths were in my arc so I could just hit through, maintaining good shape.Steve Smith was at the other end. What was he telling you?When I walked in (at no.3), we had lost an early wicket so the thought process was to build a partnership and put the bad balls away. He helped me initially in terms of what the pitch was doing and its pace.Having him open and being at the other end was very useful because he stood firm and helped us all (on reading the pitch, etc.). It was helpful as the innings went on.How were the Sharjah conditions? The venue has seen innings like Tendulkar's 'desert storm' (in 1998)?Well, it was extremely hot. In the second innings (CSK chase), we had lot of dew as well, so it was tough gripping the ball and controlling it. The wicket was also a tad slow. The 'desert storm' innings is one of the best of all time and can't really be compared to my knock. I just tried to do my best while batting and it was worth it given that we won. Your knocks are useful only when your team wins.Before the first match, what did you focus on at the nets?I've looked to get my batting rhythm going, facing as many balls as possible to get a feel of things in the UAE. I've worked on certain aspects in the nets and have had good intense sessions with the bowlers.This is your eighth IPL season. How have things changed since debut in 2013?It's been a good journey. I see it as seven years of learning and developing among some of the best cricketing minds. I was 18 when I started playing IPL, my college years, so there is a special connect. The ambition, desire and drive to do well for RR and play for India are there. You can say through the years I have matured a bit, gained good exposure and have had valuable experience. The understanding of my game and cricket overall have improved. I try to see the game through a different lens now.How do you see IPL helping realise your India aspirations?It's a massive T20 tournament with quality bowlers in every team, most of whom are regular international players. I want to score runs in every tournament I play. The IPL standard is high and a good season will be a great boost. I have been with the Indian team and it was a great experience. I would for sure like to be there again, but right now I am not thinking too far ahead.Playing with RR has helped a lot, made me flexible. I have batted in several positions--opened, come one drop, kept wicket as well as fielded. That really helps in adjusting according to the team's demand.You made an India comeback in New Zealand. With Dhoni retiring, do you see the space for a long-term replacement?They're big shoes to fill. He's set the benchmark so high for keepers around the world, in terms of keeping skills and finishing abilities with the bat. Every country hopes their wicketkeeper can somehow turn out to be like Dhoni. In India, we have some really good wicketkeeper-batsmen. There is healthy competition both in the India side and domestically. Whoever comes in knows what a massive responsibility it is. (The choices) is a good headache for the team to have. For me, it's a good position to be in because the competition forces you to improve. It will benefit the team in the long run, to have players on top of their game at all times.RR finished seventh in 2019. How has the team got stronger?It's a well-rounded team this season. Also, we have Smith as captain. He is one of the smartest cricketing brains in the world. I am excited to play under him. We have good quality in all departments, a strong core from last season. We also have some really good additions from the auctions; they are all game-changers like David Miller and Oshane Thomas. It's a good mix of experience and youth, and the variety and options makes us capable of adapting to any situation.

In the event no candidate gets a majority of the votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is tossed out of the running.

Miura was in the starting line-up for Yokohama FC’s clash against Kawasaki Frontale, and at 53 years, six months and 28 days old easily smashed the record for oldest-ever J-League first division starter set by Masashi Nakayama in 2012.
 Nakayama was a comparative spring chicken when he set the record aged just 45.
 Kazu has already set records this year, becoming the oldest player in Japan’s league cup competition.
 He was named in a J-1 squad earlier this month, but stayed on the bench.
 Wednesday’s appearance was Kazu’s first in a J-1 match since 2007 and garnered plenty of attention
 “Impressive! Kazu is my hero,” one of his fans tweeted.
 “Thanks to him, I became a football fan. He’s forever young.”
 Miura, who has been with Yokohama FC since 2005, was subbed after 56 minutes in a match which saw his side lose 3-2.
 In 2017 he became the oldest player to score a goal in a professional match, and insists he won’t hang up his boots until he turns 60.
 Miura made his Japan debut in 1990 and was a close call for the country’s first-ever World Cup appearance in 1998, but failed to make the final squad for France despite scoring 55 goals in 89 games for the national side.

“I think both of those are underrated in this day and age,” she said.
 Butler and Les Schoof, his husband, both plan to attend Thursday’s event.
 “It’s very sweet of them to do this,” said Butler of Burroughs and McAleer.
 “This is a time for a change, certainly in this time of COVID-19,” Butler said. “We have lots of changes in our world, and right now I need to concentrate on keeping our business afloat.”
 As for what he’ll miss the most in Concord, Butler was quick to say, “the challenge.”
 “There is so much good that can be done,” he said. “I am very much happy and proud to have been a part of the process.”
 Butler was first elected in 2006, and began his first term in 2007. He was defeated in the Republican tsunami of 2010 but was elected back into office in 2014.
 During his years at the State House, he has fought for a liberal agenda that has included transgender and gay rights, small business, affordable housing and health care. He also fought to legislate short-term rentals.
 “I think we did a lot,” Butler said. “The LBGTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) achievements over the years are part of what I’m most proud of — civil unions, marriage equality and finally outlawing convergent therapy.
 “I’m also very proud of the work in creating the Auto Dealers Bill of Rights, along with working on the Affordable Care Act transition.”
 Butler also played a role in presidential politics, including serving Hillary Clinton’s county chairman and was the first state representative to endorse Elizabeth Warren for president in 2019.
 “There’s definitely been a lot of fun moments,” he said.
 He added: “I’m not going away. I like to do community work and will continue to do that in some capacity. I think you’ll see me still involved.”

By “star,” we mean franchise-like quarterback, with franchise-like qualities.
 For example, Arizona’s Kyler Murray, is in the second game of his second year. And he has franchise QB-like qualities. He’s a great athlete and possibly is the quickest player in the NFL. He’s got a very good arm (he played baseball!). And he does not cower, mentally, on Sundays.
 We’re not 100% sure, but we can say, with very little reservation, Murray has that “It” factor. The Cardinals are 2-0 and look legitimate in this weakened, non-practicing NFL.
 But there are three other dudes, all drafted in the first round the year before Murray, that aren’t as accomplished or showing really any qualities of a future $30 million-plus-per-year quarterback.
 Baker Mayfield and Sam Darnold, chosen first and third overall, respectively, in 2018 by the Browns and Jets are, at best, below average.
 The No. 7 overall pick, Josh Allen, is good. The Bills love him. He is an asset. And he can make plays with his arm as much as his legs.
 Allen might be a star. Might.
 But the guy chosen three picks after Allen, at No. 10, Josh Rosen, is so down in the dumps the Cardinals gave up on him after his first year and chose Murray first overall. And, since then, he has been dealt to the Miami Dolphins and currently resides with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
 Mayfield is 13-18 as a starter. That would be considered acceptable if there was light at the end of the tunnel.
 But there is no light.
 It’s even worse for Darnold at 11-23.

Ambati Rayudu will 'at worst' miss Chennai Super Kings' next enouncer against Delhi Capitals on Friday in IPL 2020, informed CSK CEO Kasi Viswanathan. Rayudu, who was CSK's highest run-scorer for CSK in their opening match against Mumbai Indians, missed their next match against Rajasthan Royals. His absence was felt as CSK didn't have the firepower to chase down the 217-run target set by RR.
 Providing an update on the right-hander's fitness, the CSK CEO said, there is 'nothing to worry.'
 "Nothing to worry about. He has the hamstring injury, but will at worst miss one more game. But you never know, he might be fit in time for that game," he said.
 CSK will take on Delhi Capitals in their next game at the Dubai Cricket Stadium on Friday. In fact, they have a gap before playing their fourth game of the season on October 2 against Sunrisers Hyderabad in Dubai.
 Rayudu played an integral part in CSK winning the opening game of the season against Mumbai Indians (MI) at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Saturday. He hit a fluent 71 and put on a match-winning partnership with Faf du Plessis. Something they missed in their second game on Tuesday night against Rajasthan Royals.
 Speaking after the opening match heroics against MI, Rayudu had said: "We were training in lockdown, we were really eager and as we get older, we need to train so we were training. The pitch was good, once the dew came on, the pitch quickened a bit, it was doing a bit with the new ball. We practised in Chennai, it really helped and we then practiced in Dubai, so I was feeling good."

He said that the TT case of money laundering against Shahbaz Sharif and his family has entered the Accountability Court, Lahore and it is very unfortunate that his niece expelled her uncle from the party on his birthday today.
 Speaking here at news conference, he said that the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) had received reports of suspicious transactions, which led to an investigation into money laundering and now in the light of all the evidence and documentary evidence, the reference by name is with the Accountability Court, Lahore.
 Shahzad Akbar said it is strongest ever case in the history of NAB till date as it consists of 55 volumes and 25 thousand pages.
 He said that it contains all the documentary proof including banking evidence, which is simple one, the Securities and Exchange Commission company records, tax and Election Commission records, foreign exchange, swift messages, Form R and other things.
 When the US introduced legislation on money laundering in the late 1990s, he pointed out that one of the four cases cited was unfortunately taken from Pakistan and that was a case of money laundering by Asif Ali Zardari.
 He said that if anyone had to study money laundering today, it would be the TT mafia case, which would set as an example, as it is a detailed investigation to which the credit goes to the NAB investigation team.
 Shahzad Akbar said that in this 55 volume and 25 thousand pages reference, 16 accused have been named in which 6 family members including Shahbaz Sharif are the head of this ring, besides they have children whose money laundering has taken place in the name while there are 10 facilitators who have been assisting them to run this money laundering net.
 He said that four persons were also named in the case who were ready to become witnesses and assisted the prosecution by informing them of their role in the case and testified against Shahbaz Sharif & family.
 Shahzad Akbar said that three unnamed companies are also part of the reference, one is Good Nature Trading Private Company Limited, which was formed in the name of Nisar Gul and Ali Ahmed. Nisar Gul had been the Director Political Affairs of Shahbaz Sharif for 10 years in the Chief Minister's House. However, Ali Ahmed remained the director of strategy. Nisar Ahmed Gill is in custody while Ali Ahmed is a fugitive.
 Money laundering of billions of rupees, he noted, was done in this case and the reference showed direct evidence of how it was linked to Shahbaz Sharif or his family. He continued that the second unnamed company is called ‘Unitas Steel’, in which these two persons are named and the third person is Tahir Naqvi who is the assistant manager in Sharif Group of Companies.
 Shahzad Akbar said that the third unnamed company is Nisar Trading Company and this company is registered in the name of Rashid Karamat who is a purchase assistant in Sharif Group of Companies, his salary is Rs18,000 to Rs20,000 and billions of rupees came into his account.
 However, kickbacks and commissions were also collected in this company because when they had a government in Punjab, money was collected from various contractors and party people and their statements are also part of the record that they bought party tickets. The question arises as to why the money was being deposited in Nisar Trading and why it was not being deposited in the PML-N's party fund.
 He said that the second thing is positions are given in PLM-N by paying money. And some instances are quite obvious; one person was appointed in Baitul Mal, Punjab and he gave Rs10 million to Hamza Shahbaz, which he deposited in Nisar Trading.
 “As many as 177 fake foreign remittances, which we call TT in common parlance are part of the reference that I thought I would read out because today is also Shahbaz Sharif's birthday so I thought it was his birthday and I should give him a gift,” he quipped.
 He said that international money laundering was carried out in a systematic manner through 177 fake foreign remittances and NAB analysed that the black money obtained from money laundering was used by Shahbaz Sharif. He claimed that the customs duty of his imported Land Cruiser was paid to him from fake accounts. Two different houses were bought in DHA Phase 5, Lahore and they were also paid from these fake foreign remittances and also Whispering Pine Villas, which he also gave as a gift to his wife, which had also been paid by him.
 Shahzad Akbar said that the deeds of Hamza Shahbaz are also listed in it who received money directly from various contractors, party officials and businessmen of Punjab and their trusted employees Shoaib Qamar and Masroor Anwar in cash and they used to carry cheques and are currently in custody. While explaining the details, he said that for more than 50,000 transactions, a copy of the identity card has to be submitted to the bank and that is how he came to know about it, so his Oxford-educated children are advised to do money laundering in the future. “Get a car, not all education comes from Oxford, but if you go to a tote school, you can't get caught.”
 He also revealed the FIA is now investigating the Sugar Commission and the laundering of Rs9.5 billion in Ramzan Sugar Mill alone has been revealed and in it he has forged accounts. He said that money laundering of Rs9.5 billion was done using the bank accounts of 11 employees. This is just an investigation report of a sugar mill and it is not known how billions of rupees were laundered.
 He said that Ramzan Sugar Mill came in favor of Shahbaz Sharif after the family settlement. Shahbaz Sharif himself was in politics so he handed over the management of the mill to his sons Hamza and Salman Shahbaz so they are directly responsible.
 Shahzad Akbar asked Shahbaz Sharif four questions whether his sons Salman Shahbaz and Hamza Shahbaz did not run the system of corruption and kickbacks in Punjab from 2008 to 2018 on his initiative.
 He also asked whether it was not true that in order to legalise the money of this corruption, he had set up a money laundering network which he had assigned to Salman Shahbaz on a daily basis.
 He asked whether it was not right that he occasionally withdrew money from this black money to benefit from it, such as buying Whispering Pine villas, DHA houses and he imported Land Cruiser and customs duty was also paid.
 The last question, he asked was that how and with what money his family was living in London currently meeting their expenses and what their business in UK was.
 He requested Shahbaz Sharif to answer these questions honestly. “If he does not answer, I will tell you in the coming days what he is doing in London,” he remarked.
 He said it was very unfortunate that the niece kicked the uncle out of the party on his birthday.
 Meanwhile, PML-N President and Opposition Leader in National Assembly Shahbaz Sharif has warned Prime Minister Imran Khan to perpetrate cruelty of such level that he could bear himself.
 Flanked by senior party leaders including former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, Marriyum Aurangzeb and others, the opposition leader said that fate could change anytime.
 He said he and Nawaz Sharif are siding together and would play their role in putting the country back on the path to progress.
 Grilling the government for victimising his family, he stated that he used to appear before courts alone but now his daughter is also facing courts with him. He said the government's grudge against its rivals is not witnessing any end, but jails and hardships are not new for them.
 Predicting a similar fate for Imran Khan, Shahbaz said he would certainly face Makafaat-e-Amal. He said that rather than putting the country on the track to progress, Imran has pushed it backwards. The government has turned the country into Baldia Factory. Imran himself benefitted from the amnesty scheme and Imran and the Punjab chief minister's name are attributed to cases like Malam Jabba, BRT, sugar scandal but no action has been taken against them.
 Shahbaz claimed Imran could go home in a money-laundering case and 23 fake account cases were brought to surface by the Election Commission of Pakistan and the State Bank of Pakistan. He said delay in the Peshawar BRT project caused a loss of billions to the national exchequer. The Metro Orange Train Project has been facing a delay for the last two years whereas under the leadership of Nawaz Sharif, the country saved billions. He said Rana Sanaullah laid the foundation of the Safe City Project and was implicated in a fabricated case of Bhang and drugs.
 He said it was the PML-N that founded the Sahiwal Coal Project of 1300MW and it was completed in first six months that saved Rs225 billion of public money. Regarding allegations of corruption against him, he said that not a single penny was proved in the court. He challenged the government to come up with a single proof of corruption against him and if proven, he would accept any punishment. He said his body should be hanged from a pole even after his death if any irregularity is proven against him.
 He said the government has made the lives of people miserable. Commodities like Atta and sugar have disappeared from markets and the country is facing an oil crisis, but the Niazi government is busy hiding its scandals and wrongdoings. He told media about his 70th birthday and said he has turned 70, not 72.

Mr Rahat was speaking at a seminar on ‘Role of languages for promoting political harmony and peace among the people of Pakistan’ organised here by Senior Journalists Forum at National Press Club Library. Eminent social scientist Dr Nazir Mahmood was in the Chair.
 Mr Rahat said that differences were created between people speaking different languages in Sindh.
 He said that Karachi was detached from Sindh to make it the capital of the new country. But after the formation of One Unit, the issue subsided. He also referred to the separation of East Bengal during British Raj.
 He said that Centre is still controlling many functions in Karachi like access to seaport. He said apart from linguistics, the difference also erupted between rural and urban areas in the country. He called for ending the hatred between followers of different languages, ethnicity, and sects. He said that Pakistan is a country of many nationalities coming together.
 He said that urban areas in big cities like Karachi could not get the opportunity to understand the history of Sindhi civilisation but smaller cities like Nawabshah and Sukkur got to know this. The people who live in Sindh should work for Sindhi and improve the situation from wherever they came and whatever language they speak which include Punjabis, Balochis, Pathans and Tharis.
 He urged residents of Karachi and Hyderabad to do not pay heed to powers that have vested interest in divide and rule. He emphasised the creation of a Sindhi Yekjehti Forum to work for the unity of all segments of society to get united and try to achieve the objectives of unity in Sindh.
 In the question hour, a journalist raised the issue of jobs and the distribution of wealth. He said that Urdu speaking people take the urban/rural quota system an issue that is used to divide the people. He said that the religious divide is also complicating the situation as one sect is more in Urdu speaking while Pashtoons in Karachi are supportive of another sect. He denounced MQM recruiting people on linguistic grounds during their rule and now PPP following the suit. He expected from Bilawal Bhutto to handle the situation in a better way. He said that PPP can do some improvements as it has a host of intellectuals who can try to solve these issues.
 In reply, Mr Rahat said that if we take on political issues, this may lead to polemics in the start so we want the would-be forum to take along all sections.
 Nasir Zaidi, General Secretary, PFUJ, said that all issues erupted due to the building of a negative narrative in the past during Muslim League rules. He said that the resulting Fascism will be anti-language, anti-culture, and anti- democratic.
 He said that State narrative is the biggest problem that started soon after Independence with the “Urdu only” mantra.
 A lady participant said that people equated the arrival of a linguistic group from India to locust invasion but we should ignore such things. She called for preserving local and provincial languages and we should support the demand of declaring provincial languages as national languages.
 Dr Nazir said that we can change our religion but not language. He said that now the trend is on first language, the language your children are most exposed to. Many in Pakistan have English as first language of their children. Mother tongue is in the background now and one reason for this state of affairs is economics.

PHOENIX (AP) — Rookie Wyatt Mathisen hit his first two career homers, fellow rookie Daulton Varsho knocked in the go-ahead run with a triple, and the Arizona Diamondbacks rallied for a 7-3 victory over the Texas Rangers on Wednesday night.
 The Diamondbacks trailed 3-1 going into the sixth but rallied for a six-run inning off Rangers pitchers Wes Benjamin, Nick Goody and Brett Martin. Arizona sent 10 batters to the plate. Carson Kelly had a game-tying, two-run single, Varsho followed with the go-ahead triple, and then Mathisen and Tim Locastro hit back-to-back homers to push the lead to 7-3.
 It was a welcome offensive outburst for Arizona, which has been one of the worst offensive teams in the big leagues this season. Manager Torey Lovullo said he's proud his team has continued to improve, even in the final week of a season with no hope for the playoffs.
 “There was a lot of work that went into that, making those good things happen," Lovullo said. “From an offensive standpoint, we hit the pitch we were looking for. Certainly, the highlight for me was Wyatt Mathisen with a couple home runs, his first two. Big ones, too.”
 Mathisen was batting ninth in the D-backs order and had just two hits in his first 19 big-league at-bats, but he smashed homers in back-to-back innings, the fifth and sixth, with both clearing the left-center field wall. He played eight seasons in the minor leagues before making his MLB debut in 2020.
 “It's a dream come true to hit home runs in the big leagues,” Mathisen said. “It was awesome.”

The COVID-19 pandemic wasn’t the first blow to Donna Jezorwski’s business, but it nearly ended it.
 When Jezorwski closed Bloomin’ Idiots Floral Garden Center, 100 Lonesome Road, in March , she thought it might mark the end of a 16-year run in Old Forge.
 But, thanks to tremendous support from the community and financial assistance through a $35,000 Economic Injury Disaster Loan and a $2,500 county grant, she reopened this business in June .
 “It was key to allowing me to continue this fall,” she said of the loan. “Otherwise, I would have been too far in the hole. It helped me continue to pay rent, utilities and insurance.”
 While it’s too early to determine the long-term viability of the business, Jezorwski plans to take it one season at a time.
 She said the garden center made some profits in the spring and summer, but the success of the fall season will help determine if the business will stay open.
 “We’ve had very good sales so far in the fall,” Jezorwski said. “If we have a profitable fall, we’ll take on Christmas. It’s too far away to look at spring.”
 The business’ bottom-line suffered significantly when it was closed during this past spring, its most profitable time of the year.
 “Spring is our biggest season and we lost Easter, Mother’s Day, Memorial Day and spring plantings,” Jezorwski said. “That loss hurt us tremendously.”
 Several community fundraisers which generated about $3,500 also helped pay the bills, Jezorwski said.
 “I can’t say enough about the people in the community,” she said. “They always step up when people need help.”
 The business faced other obstacles including severe flooding from Hurricane Ivan, a day after opening in September 2004, which damaged or destroyed all the products, Jezorwski said. Between 2006 to 2010, a bridge replacement project on Main Street and a temporary closure of Lonesome Road also presented challenges.
 In April 2015, the Main Street Moosic Bridge was shut down due to a broken support beam, Jezorwski said. That bridge replacement project kept Main Street, the main artery to Lonesome Road, closed for nearly five years.
 While they were significant setbacks, Jezorwski said the effects of COVID-19 were by far the most damaging.
 “When the bridge was closed, we could still do business,” she said. “I was completely shut down during the pandemic.”
 Jezorwski is exploring different ways to conduct business, including potentially creating a website.
 “If anything happens again, we’d still be able to do some time of sales,” she said,
 The garden center is currently fully stocked with mums, pumpkins, hay bales, cornstalks, scarecrows and more fall items.
 Lorenzo Febbo, 20, Old Forge, has been working at the garden center for about a year and noticed Jezorwski’s connection with her customers. “She’s a people person, and very friendly and caring,” he said. “She’s always been part of the community and helped out others. Now, the community is giving back to her when she’s in need.”

Is the IPL's MVP a true reflection of a player's value during the tournament? A value that goes beyond the number of runs scored, or wickets taken? In T20, strike rates and economies assume more significance than in any other format-- just scoring is not enough, but scoring at a rate that helps your team win is critical. Similarly, taking a bagful of wickets can begin to lose its heft if you've also leaked tons of runs. The IPL's MVPs are rewarded for their individual contributions, irrespective of the team's overall performance--of the 12 MVPs so far, only three have been from the winning franchise.
 Six of the 12 MVPs were chosen because of all-round performance. Only three players--Shane Watson, Sunil Narine and Andre Russell--have had the honour twice. The award also has a batting bias, as you would expect in T20--the only time someone was declared a MVP purely for bowling was in 2012, when Narine bagged 24 wickets (Morne Morkel topped the list with 25) with a barely- believable economy of 5.47.
 Is there a way to look at a player's value beyond the obvious data? Cricviz, the sport's leading data crunchers, have a performance evaluation tool called Match Impact. It's based on predictive models of List A and T20 cricket which forecast an expected total after every ball, taking into account the current score, the host country and the venue. The model prescribes a positive or negative value after every ball--measured in runs--to the batsman, the bowler and where relevant, the fielder, according to whether their actions have increased or decreased the expected total. Wickets are prescribed a run value and the earlier in the innings they are taken, the more valuable they are.
 Using these values, we have three clear leaders from IPL history--AB de Villiers among batsmen, Lasith Malinga among bowlers, and Sunil Narine from the all-rounder's pool.
   
   
 Let's look a little deeper on what makes them so good.
 Malinga, who is set to miss at least the first half of this IPL due to personal reasons, is most scathing in the death overs, hurling those foot- jamming yorkers with staggering accuracy and consistency. Even now, no bowler has a better conversion rate in yorkers than Malinga. But it's really his low- arm, slinging action that perplexes even the most gifted batsman. When bowlers with a traditional action miss a yorker, it ends up as a full toss that usually gets worked off the pads.
 But Malinga's action makes it difficult to pick even unintended full tosses. Cram in all his variations and there is little surprise that Malinga has saved his team 623 runs more than the average bowler bowling in the same situation.
 Similarly, AB de Villiers has scored 556 runs more than the average batsman batting in the same situations as he has. To be able to maintain that edge over other batsmen despite not having the luxury of opening the batting points to his ability to turn any match on its head. Consider Monday's match where Royal Challengers Bangalore beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by 10 runs. De Villiers went to bat in the 12th over and faced 13 deliveries before hitting his first boundary. Two balls later, Virat Kohli fell, leaving de Villiers the job of steering his team to a good total. By the time he was run out in the 20th over, de Villiers had taken RCB to 162 from 90 with a 30-ball 51.
 But the match-winning detail of that innings was that after scoring 14 off 13 balls, he garnered 37 from the next 17 at a strike rate of 217.64. When you also take into account the fact that de Villiers scores 14.36 runs per over in the last three overs of a T20 innings, something no other batsman has ever achieved, you know exactly why he is special.
 Narine's impact is a two-part story. Till the last edition, Narine had bowled 426.1 overs in the IPL while conceding 6.67 per over, making him the only other bowler apart from Ashwin (econ: 6.78) to bowl more than 400 overs and average less than seven per over. And a bulk of this came while bowling during the Powerplay and the death overs, unlike most spinners in the IPL. In his first three years of IPL, Narine returned economies of 5.47 (24 wickets in 15 matches), 5.46 (22 wickets in 16 matches) and 6.35 (21 wickets in 16 matches).
 But his performance took a dip in the next few years when he was repeatedly hauled up for suspect action. Narine's most expensive outing came last season when he conceded 7.82 per over. By then, however, he was already opening the batting for three seasons.
 His overall batting average in the IPL is 17.52 with a strike rate of 168.34. While the average is not great, his strike rates are phenomenal, which means he almost guarantees his team that critical flying start. Since 2017, Narine has had strike rates of 172.3, 189.89 and 166.27, one of the best among all openers. He was most attacking in the 2018 season, scoring 357.
 That and a series haul of 17 wickets helped him bag the MVP award for that season. So, considering only the number of runs he scores does not give a complete picture of Narine--among the top 30 Powerplay batsmen since 2017, he averages 23.96, much behind David Warner (104.33) or Jos Buttler (87.28). It's his aggression that sets him apart--scoring 11.09 runs per over on average in the last three years, comfortably the highest ever.

Photo By Tech. Sgt. Andrew Jackson | The Hawaii Army National Guardʻs newest aircraft, a C-12U Huron, arrives in Hawaii on board the USS Essex (LHD-2), August 10, 2020, Honolulu Hawaii. The twin engine turbo prop aircraft is the replacement for the C-26 and restores the Hawaii Army National Guardʻs passenger and light cargo fixed wing capability. The C-12U can carry up to 15 passengers and has a range of approximately 1500 nautical miles. The Hawaii Army National Guard aircraft was given a “sea lift” on board the USS Essex (LHD 2) along with several WWII era aircraft arriving in the islands to participate the the 75th anniversary of the end of WWII. The Essex is in Hawaii to participate in an abbreviated Rim of the Pacific exercise, while ported at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam the crew will not be allowed to disembark due to COVID-19 precautions.

It is significant that the two leaders who are generally known to be ideologically distant from each other seem to be on the same page on what has become known to many Nigerians as an unsavoury state of inadequate security and lack of inter-regional peace across the nation under Buhari’s presidency. Soyinka’s statement is in sync with his flair for recognising a well-supported argument backed by incontrovertible evidence, such as the recent one from Obasanjo.

"This is a tragedy. And sometimes, the criminal law is not adequate to respond to a tragedy," he said. "And I fully acknowledge that and I know many that are watching today and those listening recognize that as well. But the response is that the grand jury was given all of the evidence, presented all the information, and ultimately, made the determination that Detective Hankison was the one to be indicted."

Despite the reform-friendly rhetoric coming from both candidates, some observers are still skeptical that criminal justice reform will be a winning issue in November.
 Jacob Joss, a data analyst at OH Predictive Insights, a local polling firm, said that traditional conservative law-and-order messaging has played well with Maricopa County voters in the past.
 "Maricopa County still leans Republican. My estimation would be that they are more likely to be receptive to tough-on-crime," he said. "But then again, in 2016, we saw in the sheriff's race between Arpaio and Penzone, it kind of flipped that on its head."
 "You see some suburban voters who are traditionally Republican being really affected by the George Floyd protests or seeing some of the more prevalent topics of police and race relations. I definitely think you might be seeing some movement there," he added. "But I'm not sure if that's just a more broad trend of the suburbs moving to the left whereas they were once very Republican."
 The two candidates' donor lists also illustrate how their respective bases of financial support remain more partisan. Gunnigle has received campaign donations from individuals like Joel Feinman, the Pima County Public Defender, Yassamin Ansari, a liberal candidate for Phoenix City Council, and a staffer at the Human Rights Campaign, according to campaign finance reports.
 Adel, in contrast, has donations from Ann Justus, a Phoenix Police Department sergeant and department spokesperson, a variety of employees at her office, local private attorneys, and Derrick Hall, president and CEO of the Arizona Diamondbacks.
 Their endorsements fall along similar partisan line. Gunnigle has lined up local Democrats such as Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, state Representative Athena Salman, as well as labor unions and musician John Legend, who has been vocal about criminal justice reform. Meanwhile, Arizona conservative big-wigs like Attorney General Mark Brnovich, Congressman Andy Biggs, and former Governor Jan Brewer have endorsed Adel.

According to IDM, cited by itmunch.com, in Australia, about 1 billion invoices are sent and received between businesses annually and only 10-15% of those bills are e-bills or e-invoices, the rest being printed on paper. The Council of Small Business Australia believes that e-invoicing is 60-80% more efficient in comparison to paper-based invoices.
