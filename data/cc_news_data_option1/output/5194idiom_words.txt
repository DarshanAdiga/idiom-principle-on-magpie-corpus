The success of our Play it By Ear programme has given us the confidence to widen our range of offerings this Christmas by presenting video streaming for the first time. We’ve been talking to our audiences a lot since March and it’s obvious that the cancellation of our panto, or the first time in almost forty years, came as a particular disappointment to many families. We’ve worked particularly hard on our online shows for families this Christmas we can’t wait to share them.


  We are so grateful to all of the magnificent artists who’ve worked with us since October as well, of course, as our wonderful staff who worked tirelessly under unprecedented circumstances to bring us to this point – we’re very, very, lucky to have them.


  It breaks our heart that we can’t admit audiences to our traditional panto this year or hear children squeal with excitement as the music starts and the curtain rises but we’re sure people will love the online shows that our panto stars are presenting this year – fairy tales with a fun twist. We won’t be able to see you but you’ll be able to see us and we’ll know you’re out there. All of us still sharing a magical Christmas experience, separate but together.
