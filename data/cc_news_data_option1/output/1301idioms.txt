Jake Tapper goes into full sad sack mode as California Governor praises Trump


--DocBreak--
PLYMOUTH - As Plymouth enters the spring of its 400th Commemoration year, aimed at honoring its Pilgrim and Wampanoag history, the federal government has ordered that lands held in trust by the Mashpee Wampanoag be removed from that protected status.
 Mashpee Wampanoag citizen Paula Peters said it was no accident that the Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt announced this news at 4 p.m. on a Friday in the midst of a pandemic that is seizing everyone's attention.
 "It's a horribly unfair decision and it won't stand," Peters said. "We're the people of the original treaty of this land that was made between the colonists in Plymouth and the Wampanoag sachem Ousamequin in 1621, and those promises have been repeatedly broken, and now they're being broken once again."
 Peters argued that the federal government can't legally remove the land from its trust status. Wampanoag health services and programs have been dispensed on these lands for so long, she added. She noted that the Mashpee have been a tribal reservation since the 1600s.
 "It won't stand because the rest of Indian country is outraged, because they know if Trump can do this to us, he is going to come for every other tribe," Peters said. "It's not just us. It's the policies against the environment, the removal of protections against tribes, the environment, women, immigrants. I am devastatingly sad about what is happening. It is not so selfish as to believe that this is just about me and my tribe; this is an overwhelming policy of greed by this administration."
 U.S. Rep. William Keating, D-Bourne, had this to say about the issue: "In a time of national health and economic emergency, the secretary of the interior should be reaching out to help all Native American tribes. This is one of the most cruel and nonsensical acts I have seen since coming to Congress. The secretary should be ashamed. This also calls out the need for the Senate to act on the dual bipartisan proposals led by myself and Rep. Cole, which would rectify this issue."
 Keating is pushing for passage of a bill he authored that would reestablish the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe reservation as trust land in Massachusetts. The bill, H.R. 312, would also require "actions pending in federal court, relating to the land to be dismissed."
 The bill passed the House of Representatives last May, and Keating is hoping the Senate will follow suit.
 The Mashpee Wampanoag were excluded from the Indian Reorganization Act due to a confusing and complex legal decision, according to Keating. The release notes that in 2015, the Obama Interior Department granted the Mashpee Wampanoag land through a "different interpretation" of the Indian Reorganization Act.
 However, in 2018, the Interior Department under the Trump Administration reversed the Obama Administration's position, stripping the Mashpee Wampanoag of their land.
 In a speech to the House on the bill in 2019, Keating urged its passage, saying the federal government was refusing to honor the Mashpee Tribe's right to its historic land.
 "It's the only tribe that has received recognition and had it taken away from them," Keating said. "This is an existential threat. Without support from Congress it will be nearly impossible for the Mashpee to engage in any kind of self governance."
 In February, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the Mashpees' claim for trust protection. A group of abutters to the Taunton site where the tribe planned a $1 billion casino had sued the federal government for granting the tribe trust protection. The protection would have extended to 151 acres in Taunton, where the tribe was hoping to site a casino and resort, and 170-acres in Mashpee.
 Calls to the Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt were not returned.
 The Mashpee lands encompass the tribe's cultural heartbeat, its seat of government, cultural centers, museum, hunting and fishing grounds, as well as shellfish aquaculture and green houses, according to Peters.
 "I'm 60 years old, for crying out loud," Peters said. "Russell Peters was my father. He was a tribal leader at the time when we originally petitioned the government for acknowledgement, suing for tribal land. My dad died waiting for a letter back on that one. That's just how we live - to fight for every piece of what is rightfully ours every day."

The provision relaxes the limitations on a company’s use of losses. Net operating losses (NOL) are currently subject to a taxable-income limitation, and they cannot be carried back to reduce income in a prior tax year. The provision provides that an NOL arising in a tax year beginning in 2018, 2019, or 2020 can be carried back five years. The provision also temporarily removes the taxable income limitation to allow an NOL to offset income fully. These changes will allow companies to utilize losses and amend prior year returns, which will provide critical cash flow and liquidity during the COVID-19 emergency.

The primary camera comes with a very large 1/1.28″ 50MP Quad-Bayer sensor that produces 12MP image output. As with other devices with similar sensors, it uses pixel binning to increase dynamic range and low-light capabilities. The lens features an f/1.9 aperture and nominal 23mm-equivalent focal length, however, Huawei crops the field of view to a more conventional 27mm. This decision was presumably made in order to design a thinner camera unit, but it should also help with reducing such artifacts as corner softness and distortion. Optical image stabilization, which can be challenging to implement on such large image sensors, is on board as well.

The numbers are likely to increase as the lean season fully sets in from April until the rains come (if they do). Rain-fed agriculture, which the country has largely depended on in the past, is no longer reliable, as climate change has shortened the agricultural season and dramatically reduced yields for poor, smallholder farmers — the majority of whom are women, residing in rural areas. With unemployment estimated to be as high as 80%, and the majority of people now earning their livelihoods in the informal sector, and, therefore, living from hand to mouth, a 21-day lockdown (which may well be extended) is going to be devastating.

“We qualified for the Africa Cup of Nations and the women version of the tournament as well for the first time. Our clubs also have done well in continental events.
 “We have an under-13 and under-15 league and all this risk being going down the drain if we are banned.”
 Geoffrey Indengu, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Bungoma Super Stars, said the clubs risk losing out on talented players who will not have an opportunity to play for Harambee Stars in case of a Fifa ban.
 “Our players are young and their dream is to play for the national teams at some point in their career. If we get banned, that dream will go down the drain. My plea is that we resolve our issues internally before it gets too far and Fifa decides to ban us.
 “I ask that those who want to contest in the elections should present their papers and delegates be allowed to make a decision on whom to elect.”
 Patrick Wekesa, the Secretary General of Transfoc FC, adds that a ban will force the clubs to go back and start from scratch.
 “We have made good progress over the last four years. If Kenya is banned, we will be forced to go back to the start and risk taking our talent to waste apart from the economic impact the country will be subjected to,” he said.
 And Patrick Buluma from Ligi Ndogo believes a ban will take away the motivation for teams to play.
 “Our teams take to the pitch knowing that they are playing for promotion. If we are banned, that motivation goes out of the window and we have nothing to play for,” he said.

The probability of a massive Khaitab Hezbollah-Iranian response to any concerted US attack on PMF forces in Iraq has led the US commander in Iraq, Lieutenant General Robert White, to issue a stark warning that any such attack would “require that thousands more American troops be sent to Iraq and divert resources from what has been the primary American military mission there: training Iraqi troops to combat the Islamic state.” General White’s blunt warning is, in fact, an understatement. In their haste to promote regime change in Iran, Trump administration hardliners like Pompeo and O’Brien have exaggerated the vulnerability of the Iranian regime, especially in light of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, while minimizing the threat to US forces in Iraq.

Judith (Judy) Pack McWhorter      Knoxville - Judith (Judy) Pack McWhorter, born April 28, 1940 in Cleveland, Tennessee, passed away suddenly on March 30, 2020 at the University of Tennessee Medical Center in Knoxville. Judy was preceded in death by her mother, Lois Harrison Pack and her father, John Anderson Pack. She is survived by her loving husband of 55 years, Jerry, daughters Jennifer Mulkey, Athens, Georgia, Amy Clarke (Ken), Franklin, Tennessee, and Julie McWhorter Moore (Roger), Knoxville. Grandchildren are Jackson Mulkey, Sean Mulkey, Andrew Mulkey, and Lane Mulkey of Athens Georgia; John Clarke, William Clarke, and Harrison Clarke of Franklin, Tennessee; and Anderson McWhorter Smith of Knoxville. Judy is also survived by sister Jane Pack Miller, brother-in-law Jon C. McWhorter and his wife Malenda McWhorter, all of Knoxville, as well as several cousins and relatives.      Judy was a graduate of the University of Tennessee with degrees in Business Administration and Education. She taught primary school in Atlanta and later in Knoxville at Sacred Heart Cathedral School. Judy was a leader in her youth; she was cheerleading captain at Sweetwater High School and was also valedictorian of her senior class. Judy was a member of Phi Mu sorority at the University of Tennessee and later was a member of the Nine O'Clock Cotillion. Judy was a long-time member of First United Methodist Church and the Christian Forum Sunday School Class.      Judy was dearly loved by those who knew her. She had a special talent for making people comfortable in a conversation. Her husband recounted that many times at gatherings of people at church or social events, others were drawn to her by her loving and caring manner.      Judy's husband and family would like to express appreciation to the ER staff at Tennova North Hospital, Dr. Philip McKeown, and the OR team at UT Medical Center who worked so hard in an effort to save her.      Because of the current contagious atmosphere, Judy was laid to rest in a private service at Highland Memorial Cemetery with Reverend Troy Forrester officiating. A celebration of life is to be held at a later date.      In lieu of flowers, memorials may be made to First United Methodist Church, 3316 Kingston Pike, Knoxville, TN 37919.

Arsenal are currently being linked with a move to sign Lille striker Victor Osimhen, but the 21 year-old’s story is one of struggle and determination.
 The youngster has overcome a number of obstacles in his life, from his mother dying at a very early in the players life, to having to scrape by with very little in Laos Nigeria. He talks about scouring dumps for football boots, sometimes wearing odd pairs just in order to play the game he loved.
 “It was survival,” he told France Football. “Sometimes you found yourself with a right-footed Nike boot then you’d have to look for the other foot… Finally, you find a left boot and it’s a Reebok!
 “My brother sold sports newspapers, my sister, oranges in the street, and me, bottled water in Lagos in the middle of the traffic.
 “Part of my life has been a struggle to survive. But that’s what made me all I am today. Each event created my personality.”
 Osimhen also didn’t have an easy start to his early career, having suffered bouts of malaria which saw him fail trials with clubs Zulte-Waregem and club Brugge, before finally making his mark on loan with Charleroi, also in Belgium.
 Last summer he made the move to France however, and hit the ground running for Lille, and his former team-mate in Nicolas Penneteau has likened him to Didier Drogba, a player Arsenal fans will not have the fondest memories of
 “I’m sure he’s going to be a phenomenon,” Penneteau said. “I’d compare him to Didier Drogba. He really makes me think of him. He has the same profile. He can do everything and he’s phenomenally powerful.”
 A potential obstacle in our bid to sign the highly-rated Nigeria international could be his asking price. Some report that his club will want as much £89 Million for his signature this summer, a fee likely to put off our club.
 I would hate to see a possible new Drogba join another Premier League side, given the torment he put us through during his time with Chelsea, but the prospect of having our own strong bullying forward is an exciting one.
 Could he be the long-term replacement for Aubameyang? Will Arteta be backed strongly in the coming window to be able to spend such amounts?

Clubs taking part in the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) Division One League have voiced their concerns over the current impasse over the FKF election.
 The clubs are concerned that if a quick solution is not arrived at, the country might be banned by the world football governing body, Fifa, which will all but cripple their operations.
 The teams, competing in the country's third tier league, have also pointed out that the stability built up over the last few years risks being eroded and lead to flight of sponsors if the current impasse is not settled.
 “We have well organised leagues and we don’t hear of teams going to court because of promotion or relegation. Because of these, sponsors have started coming on board," Patrick Orwako, BuruBuru Sports chairman, said.
 “We risk losing all these gains and sponsors running away as no one will want to associate with someone who has been banned by Fifa,” he added.
 Orwako also pointed out that football has grown tremendously in the last few years with a marked improvement in the performance of Kenyan teams.

Mumbai, Apr 2 (PTI) The Mumbai Police has registered 709 offences against as many as 1,364 people for violating prohibitory orders during the coronavirus lockdown in the last 13 days, an official said on Thursday.
 The Maharashtra government has invoked section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) and the state is under lockdown in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 The police have registered around 709 offences against 1,364 people under section 188 (disobeying an order issued by a public servant) of the Indian Penal Code since March 20, the official said.
 Of the 1,364 accused, 1,100 were arrested and later released on bail, while 166 were allowed to go after being served notices to appear before court as and when required, he said.
 At least 98 accused were still at large, he added.
 The police have also penalised drivers of 269 vehicles, which were being plied during the lockdown, the official said.

New Delhi, Apr 2 (PTI) The central government has asked states to continue to buy power from renewable energy producers and clear their dues "on a regular basis as was being done prior to the lockdown".
 The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy on April 1 wrote to all states and electricity distribution companies after renewable energy producers complained that some states were curtailing purchase and payment for electricity generated from sources such as solar energy.
 In the letter, the ministry said the power ministry has recently issued instructions providing for a moratorium to distribution companies or discoms for making payments to electricity generating companies in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak and the following nationwide lockdown.
 Some state discoms, however, used that order to start curtailing renewable energy power terming the prevailing situation a 'force majeure' condition.
 The ministry, according to the letter reviewed by PTI, directed the discoms to accept invoices and billing through emails and make payments to renewable energy generators as per their power purchasing agreements (PPAs).
 "Renewable energy generating stations have been granted 'must-run' status and this status of 'must-run' remains unchanged during the period of lockdown," it said.
 Solar and wind electricity generating stations have been granted a place in the "essentials" list exempted from the lockdown, and they will be allowed to continue to function during the lockdown period.
 "Since discoms have already been given sufficient relief and as electricity from renewable energy (RE) comprises only a minor portion of the total electricity generation in the country, the payments to RE generators be done on a regular basis as was being done prior to the lockdown," it said.
 The direction from the Centre followed Indian Renewable Energy Alliance writing to the ministry saying the generators need a continuous flow of cash to ensure they stay afloat, keep plants running, repair any failures, buy spare parts and continue to employ workforce.
 "Now despite there being no mention of a moratorium on the payments to be made by the discoms (to renewable energy generators), some discoms are purposely misconstruing the intent to deny payments to RE generators," it had written on March 31.
 It said RE industry was already grappling with payment issues from state discoms and was still in a long onging legal battle with Andhra Pradesh discoms.
 "On top of that, if generation payments abruptly stop from the discoms who are buying our energy, there will be hugely negative consequences for the entire RE industry," the letter said warning of the industry's ability to operate and maintain the power plants, pay solar park charges and land lease charges.
 Also, in the absence of the payments, they may not be able to service a large pool of overseas debt.
 "All of this will lead to a loss of jobs for labour and contractors at the site, income for small owners, and damaging all the future investments in the solar sector," it wrote.
 Industry chamber FICCI also wrote to Power and Renewable Energy Minister R K Singh on March 30 stating if generation payments abruptly stop from all discoms, who are buying their energy, there will be huge negative consequences for the entire RE industry, impacting their ability to operate and maintain the power plants.
 "This will lead to loss of jobs," it said.
 FICCI said while the three-month loan moratorium advisory announced by the RBI is a positive step, it may not be sufficient to sustain RE generators.
 "RE sector will still need to service the significant international debt exposure in the form of ECB and green bonds," it wrote.
 Stating that RE generation industry needs a continuous flow of cash to ensure they stay afloat, FICCI said considering the gravity and extent of the pandemic, it is vital that liquidity in the sector is not impacted.

 The actor said there was a scarcity of essential food items during the initial days of the 21-day lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24.
 "Everybody is facing difficulties. The first week was very hard here in Goa but now vegetable shops are open. Goa was in a bad situation. Everything was locked down so there was nothing available, no water, vegetables, ration. One couldn't go out to buy anything because the cops would stop you and hit people, like whoever was trying to go anywhere would get hit," Ali told PTI in an interview.
 The actor, who stays in Delhi, had come to meet her daughter in Goa for over a week but they could not get back after the lockdown.
 "My daughter said because I am under cancer remission so I am at a big risk so she told me to come to Goa. Now, my medicines are running out slowly. For my cancer treatment, I have some medicines which are not available anywhere in Goa. They are all lying in Delhi and the courier services are closed so they cannot be sent.
 "As and when my medicines finishes I will stop taking them because they are not available. What to do? I understand the situation is such one can't help," Ali added.
 In November 2018, Ali had revealed on social media that she was diagnosed with stage three cancer. She is now cancer-free.
 Ali said the situation has improved in the state with vegetable shops opening in the last two days.
 "Ideally, when you say lockdown, you should give 24 hours to stock up essential things," she said.
 The 63-year-old actor also shared that her niece, who had been to Switzerland, had tested positive for Coronavirus and was undergoing treatment at a hospital in Bangalore. She has now recovered.
 "My niece, who came from Switzerland tested positive, she was in isolation at a Bangalore hospital. For hours, nobody comes to see you, or gives you water or food… There should be a kit ready with essential items. This is unfortunate. That is why I sent a tweet to Prime Minister Narendra Modi... Hospital authorities should have a kit with food and water."
 Meanwhile, the actor is staying positive by spending time with family and painting.
 "I am alone here so in the evening I meet my grandchildren, besides that I paint. One has to live and learn and be helpful to each other during crisis."

 Judith (Judy) Pack McWhorter Knoxville - Judith (Judy) Pack McWhorter, born April 28, 1940 in Cleveland, Tennessee, passed away suddenly on March 30, 2020 at the University of Tennessee Medical Center in Knoxville. Judy was preceded in death by her mother, Lois Harrison Pack and her father, John Anderson Pack. She is survived by her loving husband of 55 years, Jerry, daughters Jennifer Mulkey, Athens, Georgia, Amy Clarke (Ken), Franklin, Tennessee, and Julie McWhorter Moore (Roger), Knoxville. Grandchildren are Jackson Mulkey, Sean Mulkey, Andrew Mulkey, and Lane Mulkey of Athens Georgia; John Clarke, William Clarke, and Harrison Clarke of Franklin, Tennessee; and Anderson McWhorter Smith of Knoxville. Judy is also survived by sister Jane Pack Miller, brother-in-law Jon C. McWhorter and his wife Malenda McWhorter, all of Knoxville, as well as several cousins and relatives. Judy was a graduate of the University of Tennessee with degrees in Business Administration and Education. She taught primary school in Atlanta and later in Knoxville at Sacred Heart Cathedral School.

She had a special talent for making people comfortable in a conversation. Her husband recounted that many times at gatherings of people at church or social events, others were drawn to her by her loving and caring manner. Judy's husband and family would like to express appreciation to the ER staff at Tennova North Hospital, Dr. Philip McKeown, and the OR team at UT Medical Center who worked so hard in an effort to save her. Because of the current contagious atmosphere, Judy was laid to rest in a private service at Highland Memorial Cemetery with Reverend Troy Forrester officiating. A celebration of life is to be held at a later date. In lieu of flowers, memorials may be made to First United Methodist Church, 3316 Kingston Pike, Knoxville, TN 37919.

 The company says the additional steps are in response to the low global oil price environment that it expects to continue for an unknown period. It had paid a quarterly dividend of 6.25 cents per share.
 The cut to its capital spending plan comes on top of a $450-million reduction made on March 9. Cenovus now expects to spend between $750 million and $850 million this year.
 The company is also forecasting operating cost reductions of about $100 million and reduction to general and administrative costs of about $50 million compared with its December budget.

Mumbai, Apr 2 (PTI) Due to the coronavirus outbreak, Maharashtra is likely face a tricky political situation soon as Uddhav Thackeray, who took oath as the state chief minister in November last year, has to get elected to either House of the state legislature by the end of May.
 Thackeray, who is still not a member of either the state Legislative Assembly or Council, was sworn in as the chief minister on November 28, 2019 following an unprecedented month-long political drama after the assembly poll results.
 As per Article 164 (4) of the Constitution, a minister, who for any period of six consecutive months is not a member of the legislature shall at the expiration of that period ceases to be a minister. The six-month period in Thackeray's case will end on May 28.
 However, due to the coronavirus outbreak and the ongoing lockdown, the political activity in the state has come to a standstill.
 The gram panchayat elections scheduled to be held in March were also deferred.
 Nine legislative council seats are falling vacant on April 24 and Thackeray was set to be elected as an MLC during the biennial elections to these nine seats.
 However, the Election Commission of India (ECI) has still not announced the election schedule due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 The ECI had earlier deferred the Rajya Sabha polls in view of COVID- 19 and said that the fresh date would be announced later.
 Similarly, the by-election to the Maharashtra Legislative Council from the Dhule Nandurbar local authorities constituency scheduled on March 24 was also postponed.
 According to sources, if the dates for the biennial elections to nine legislative council seats are not announced after the lockdown period ends on April 14, the state may head for a political logjam.
 Thackeray may have to resign from his post and cannot be sworn in till he becomes a member of either house of the legislature.
 Sources in the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), however, said the situation will not go that extent.
 Sources said that in the past, NCP leader Fauzia Khan and Shiv Sena's Deepak Sawant, who were members of the legislative council, had continued as ministers after their term as MLC ended.
 "But both- Fauzia Khan, who was school education minister in the Prithivraj Chavan government, and Deepak Sawant, who was health minister in the Devendra Fadnavis government- resigned later," sources said.
 According to sources, Khan and Sawant were already members of the legislature and ministers so they could continue for another six months.
 "But in Thackeray's case, he is not a member of the legislature and within six months, he has to become an MLA or an MLC. The six-month time-frame is not extended as per constitutional provisions," they said.
 "The minister, in this case the chief minister, has to get elected in six months, failing which he ceases to be in the post," sources said.
 This is a peculiar political situation for which Thackeray may have to step aside and make way for other Sena leaders like Eknath Shinde or Subhash Desai, who are ministers in his cabinet.
 Sources, however, said that Thackeray would have the option of getting elected as one of the 12 Governor appointees. Vacancies for the 12 seats will be in June.
 When asked about it, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut told PTI, "We haven't given a thought to this issue as yet. But a solution would be found. A situation will not arise that the state may have to face a political crisis, I can say this with confidence."
 In the past, Sushilkumar Shinde and Prithviraj Chavan had become chief ministers when they were not member of either house of the state legislature. But within six months, Shinde was elected to the Assembly, while Chavan chose the Council route.
 Sources said a Supreme Court judgement ruled that Article 164 (4) places a restriction on a non-member to continue as minister or chief minister unless he can get himself elected to the legislature within a period of six months from the date of his appointment.
 The supreme court order was in respect to a case in Punjab where Tej Parkash Singh was made a minister in 1995 when he was not member of the legislature. He failed to get himself elected in six months and resigned.
 Talking to PTI, former state legislature principal secretary Anant Kalse said the court judgements in such cases are about misuse of Article 164 (4).
 "In this (Thackeray's) case, there is no misuse. There is an unprecedented situation due to which elections could not be held. If the elections to the legislative council are not announced till May end, then the chief minister can resign and the entire council of ministers can take oath again," he said.
 "Or else, he can become a member of the Legislative Council as a Governor appointee for the time being," he said.
 A senior NCP minister said at present there are two governor appointee vacancies from the party quota.
 Rahul Narvekar and Ram Wadkute, both NCP MLCs from the governor appointee category resigned as members to join the BJP before the assembly elections.
 Narvekar is now a BJP MLA from Colaba in Mumbai.
 "Everybody is now busy with coronavirus eradication. We have not given a thought to this issue as yet. But the matter would be resolved," a Congress minister said.

On a positive note, a crisis can also bring out the best in people. People in Zimbabwe have a history of collective action and resilience in hard times. The COVID-19 pandemic, however, is unfamiliar to most people, and social distancing runs counter to human nature. But that does not mean that we don’t have to take this pandemic seriously. There is one thought that is comforting: everyone is affected by this. This is a time for communities to find common purpose, even if people are forced to stay apart. Understanding and reminding ourselves that we are all going through something together, sometimes that can help us feel less alone. It’s too early to know how long this crisis will last or what its ultimate toll will be. Experts have suggested it might be comparable to the 1957 influenza pandemic, though it is not out of the question that it could be as severe as the Spanish Flu.

Even though some local law enforcement agencies are witnessing a decrease in calls for service and adapting to temporary changes due to coronavirus precautions, it’s still business as usual.
 “We’re not turning our heads to crime. Contrary to what’s going around on Facebook, we’re still making arrests. If you’re putting yourself or someone at risk, you’re going to jail,” said Monroe County Sheriff Kevin Crook.
 Amory Police Chief Ronnie Bowen said calls have been down, citing a 35 percent decrease in calls for service March 24 as an example.
 His department recently underwent temporary changes such as limiting visitors to the lobby; general reports, which don’t require an officer on the scene, being done over the telephone or by personal visits in the lobby; and not providing fingerprinting for the public as precautions.
 “We’re trying to limit our exposure from one place to another to avoid being potential carriers,” Bowen said. “We’re still out patrolling, making arrests and making traffic stops.”
 Aberdeen Police Chief Henry Randle said activity throughout town constituting arrests and enforcement has recently been low.
 “With the coronavirus, we haven’t had much. People are still out and about but not to the magnitude where we’d have to go and disburse,” he said. “Crime has been down for a while, and I’m still pinching myself to make sure it’s not a dream.”

Madrid, Apr 2 (AFP) Confirmed coronavirus cases approached one million around the world on Thursday as Europe reeled from the pandemic and the US prepared for what President Donald Trump warned would be "horrific" days ahead.
 The virus claimed thousands more lives in its relentless march across the globe, including nearly 1,000 new deaths in Spain, despite more than half of the planet subjected to some form of lockdown.
 And it continued to wreak havoc on the global economy, with Spain reporting its biggest monthly increase in jobless claims on record and the US expected to reveal more massive job losses.
 Since emerging in China in December, COVID-19 has infected more than 940,000 people -- including at least 500,000 in Europe -- and claimed more than 47,000 lives, according to a tally by AFP from official sources.
 World Health Organization head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said there had been a "near exponential growth" in new cases over the past five weeks and a doubling of deaths in the past week alone. "In the next few days we will reach one million confirmed cases and 50,000 deaths," he told a virtual news conference on Wednesday, warning that Africa and Latin America needed to be prepared for a wider impact.
 New figures on infection rates and virus-related deaths would show Thursday whether there were signs the epidemic could be peaking in Europe, where at least 34,000 have died. Britain and France both reported their highest daily death tolls on Wednesday, but infection rates in Italy and Spain -- the two countries hardest hit -- were slowing.
 Spain said on Thursday it had suffered a record 950 deaths in 24 hours, bringing the total number of fatalities to 10,003. The number of confirmed cases passed the 110,000 mark, the government said, although the rates of both new infections and deaths continued a downward trend. "The data show the curve has stabilised" and the epidemic has entered a "slowdown" phase, Health Minister Salvador Illa said.
 Spain, the eurozone's fourth-largest economy, also registered a leap of 302,265 jobless claims last month after imposing a nationwide lockdown since March 14.
 The virus has chiefly affected the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions, but recent cases have highlighted that it can kill people from all walks of life.
 The dead have included a 16-year-old in France, a 12-year-old in Belgium and Ismail Mohamed Abdullah, 13, in Britain, whose family said the "gentle and kind" boy had no underlying health issues. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, himself in isolation after testing positive, announced plans for a massive increase in virus testing after it emerged that just 2,000 of hundreds of thousands of staff in the state-run National Health Service (NHS) had been tested.
 The United States, which now accounts for almost a quarter of reported global infections, saw its death toll pass 5,000 by the early hours of Thursday, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Among the latest known US fatalities was a six-week-old baby who was taken to a Connecticut hospital late last week.
 "Testing confirmed last night that the newborn was COVID-19 positive," the state's Governor Ned Lamont tweeted. "This is absolutely heartbreaking." Trump, who was criticised for initially playing down the virus but has stepped up containment efforts in recent days, warned that the situation was going to get much worse. "We're going to have a couple of weeks, starting pretty much now, but especially a few days from now, that are going to be horrific," he said.
 "But even in the most challenging of times, Americans do not despair. We do not give in to fear." More than three-quarters of Americans are under lockdown, including tens of thousands of prisoners, who were told Wednesday they would be confined to their cells for two weeks.
 Officials also shuttered the Grand Canyon to prevent tourists gathering there, and New York announced that outdoor basketball courts would be closed as the city grapples with sky-rocketing infections and a severely strained health system.
 The US Labor Department was due on Thursday to provide weekly figures on first-time claims for unemployment benefits after last week's report showed a record 3.3 million filed claims. Economists are warning that US job losses could surge to the previously unimaginable range of 10 to 20 million in April.
 The virus and the measures taken to contain it have raised fears of the worst global economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
 It has also claimed the lives of many high-profile figures, including on Wednesday jazz legend Ellis Marsalis, whose family said the "giant of a musician and teacher" died at the age of 85 after contracting the virus. (AFP)
