Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, last year’s Nobel Peace Prize winner, announced the military campaign against the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) on November 4, saying it came in response to TPLF-orchestrated attacks on federal army camps.


  Abiy declared victory after federal forces took the regional capital Mekele in late November, but the UN says clashes persist in the region and TPLF leaders remain on the run. The military will pay 10 million Ethiopian birr (roughly $250,000 / 205,000 euros) to "any person who knows the exact location of the TPLF junta leadership", the Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation quoted Lieutenant General Asrat Denero, head of the military’s community information department, as saying on Friday.


  Asrat also provided a hotline where citizens could give tips. Two days after Mekele fell, Abiy told lawmakers that federal forces were monitoring TPLF leaders closely from "the situation room" and would apprehend them soon.


  He said TPLF leaders had fled west of the city, though Debretsion Gebremichael, president of Tigray when the conflict started, told AFP at the time that Abiy had the location wrong. Debretsion and other TPLF leaders have been unreachable for nearly two weeks.


  On November 13 federal police announced arrest warrants for Debretsion and 63 other TPLF leaders. It was not immediately clear Friday if the reward offer applied to all of them.


  The fighting in Tigray has left thousands dead, according to the International Crisis Group (ICG) think tank, and sent tens of thousands of refugees streaming across the border into Sudan.


  The UN has been lobbying -- so far unsuccessfully -- for unfettered access to the region to provide humanitarian assistance. On Thursday it announced a $35.6 million emergency aid package for civilians caught up in the conflict.

Mia Rubín ha crecido rodeada de los reflectores y la música gracias al trabajo de sus padres, Erik Rubín y Andrea Legarreta. Apenas con 15 años, la joven realizará su debut como cantante con _Raíces_ , un concierto vía streaming que ofrecerá junto a su papá.
 “Ha sido emocionante pensar que voy debutar como cantante porque es algo que soñé desde niña. Y hacerlo con mi papá, que tiene años de experiencia y que lo admiro y lo amo con todo mi corazón, ha sido increíble”, cuenta la joven cantante en entrevista.

 Desde hace más de tres meses, padre e hija han trabajado en adaptar algunas canciones de Timbiriche como _Si no es ahora_ o _Muriendo lento_ para adaptarlas a sonidos latinos y urbanos, lo cual es la columna vertebral de este proyecto musical que podrá verse hoy en vivo por Cinépolis Klic.
 “Estas son canciones súper emblemáticas y han marcado a muchas personas, incluso de mi generación debido a los papás. Yo tengo muchos amigos que siguen escuchándolas por lo importantes que fueron y me tiene emocionada darles voz porque las he escuchado miles de veces en el escenario y ahora me toca cantarlas”, dice Mía al teléfono.
 Erik Rubín ha llevado la batuta de este proyecto desde que la empresa de streaming le propuso unir su voz junto a su hija. El show incluirá canciones de su carrera junto a Timbiriche, como solista y algunos temas que hizo en el proyecto Sasha, Benny y Erik, por lo que para él, el mayor compromiso ha sido respetar la esencia de estas canciones y brindarles un sonido que se adecúe a las tendencias actuales.
 “Hemos hecho un ejercicio para ver cuáles canciones sí quedaban en una nueva versión, porque no se trata de un palomazo. Por ejemplo, _Princesa tibetana_ es una canción que no puedes sacar de su estilo pop rock, pero las que elegimos están ahí porque sentimos que cabían perfecto; las versiones van desde el bolero, la bachata y lo latino. _Cada beso_ hasta suena mejor que la versión que teníamos”, dice el cantante soltando una risa.
 Erik Rubín define _Raíces_ como “un proyecto con estrella”, pues aunque apenas se estrena este sábado, ya se tiene planeado continuar con otras variantes: “Queremos sacar un disco juntos el próximo año y hay interés de un empresario por comprarnos la gira”.
 El concierto vía streaming incluirá las canciones _Veneno_ , _Te lo dije_ y _La flecha_ , que serán tres temas originales interpretados por padre e hija. “Esta es la primera tanda que hemos hecho con temas a la medida para Mia. Pero ella ya tiene tiempo componiendo y hemos trabajado con canciones que tenemos por ahí y que sacaremos más adelante”.
 Tras este proyecto, Mia Rubín planea iniciar su propia carrera como solista. En su mente está crear música que funcione como “un bálsamo de amor” para los escuchas, por lo que pensar en géneros o tendencias musicales no es una opción.
 “La industria ya está muy mezclada y los géneros se van distorsionando cada vez más. Quisiera hacer un poco de todo mientras suene correcto para mi voz”, concluye.

The Reds, shockingly, have never had a director of football within the club’s hierarchy, a decision which fans and pundits are frequently left baffled by.
 It goes without saying that every club needs to have recruitment specialists as teams seek to install a rigid identity, something best demonstrated by the likes of Ajax, Borussia Dortmund and Liverpool.
 However, despite their huge spending in recent years, United continually struggle to form an on-field personality.
 One area of the club’s processes which finally looks set to be resolved is their non-existent director of football role which has previously been filled in by the likes of executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward and chief negotiator, Matt Judge.
 According to a recent report from Record Sport, United have narrowed their search for a top-tier recruitment specialist down to just a few possible candidates, including Lille’s Luis Campos.
 It has been reported that Campos is tempted by the prospect of plying his trade in the illustrious Premier League but it has also been noted that his services are attracting the interest of some of Europe’s biggest clubs.
 Elsewhere, AS Monaco sporting director Paul Mitchell, who has previous working connections with Mauricio Pochettino from the pair’s time with Spurs has also been included.

Throughout the summer of 2012, Donegal had the conditioning and game plan and will power to impose their game on the opposition. Their success sent the game tearing in a new direction. And their success also meant that what Horan had achieved with Mayo over the same period of time was largely overlooked. Horan stepped down in 2014 but the bloody -minded conviction remained.

BRANCH COUNTY -- The local C19 Relief Task Force gave Family Promise $5,000 to help with issues created by COVID-19 for its homeless program.


   


  Family Promise Executive Director Terri Huffman explained the group founded in 2000 "to assist those that are experiencing homelessness. We historically have been a program that utilized churches and volunteers to house individuals and assist them with re-establishing themselves in the community."


   


  She explained "because of COVID-19 we have had to redesign how we are housing those in need. We currently have rented a home and are housing single women, families and men with children. This has added different needs to our program which includes evening security coverage."


   


  The grand funds will allow for evening security for those housed. It will also allow for funds to take care of health needs created by the COVID-19 pandemic.


   


  The C19 Relief Task Force recently decided to support a project which provides the funds necessary for Family Promise to add non-resident evening health and security services since it fits the parameters of its goal to provide local support for those impacted by COVID-19.


   


  The $5,000 grant will provide initial funds to allow Family Promise to hire a qualified person to perform the health and safety duties.


   


  Huffman said Family Promise then can continue to fund the position with additional support coming from a reimbursable grant for which they have qualified.


   


  Huffman said the initial CC19 Relief Task Force grant was important.


   


  "This donation will enhance our ability to ensure our guests needs are being met and they are living in a secure environment. Family Promise is maintained through volunteers, grants and donations. Our community has blessed us with great sup-port."


   


  Two local Rotary Clubs started the program this spring. The C19 Relief Task Force project was first funded the Coldwater Township Sunrise Rotary Club and the Coldwater Noon Rotary Club. Each of which made the initial $2,500 donation.


   


  Most of the community support and service organizations in the area joined and now includes the Sunrise, Noon and Quincy Rotary Clubs, the Early Bird and Noon Exchanges Clubs, Kiwanis, Altrusa, the United Way, the Branch County Community Foundation and the Branch County Coalition Against Domestic Violence.


   


  To date this coalition has approved projects and collectively funded over $42,000 of relief for acute C19 related needs in the region.

Mandela’s words guided Dickson through the worst period of his life. As Covid-19 turned the world upside down, Dickson was out of work, and depressed for months as the pandemic halted the luxury cruising industry.
 Dickson worked for Wind Star Cruises as a guest services manager on the luxury yacht the Star Legend, a job that came with many perks, which include travelling the globe.
 Distraught yet still hopeful, Dickson turned to God, and through divine intervention, he wasted no time putting his Trinidad and Tobago Hospitality and Tourism Institute training, as well as his world-class customer service training, to use.
 Dickson roused up other family members to put their best foot forward and to take advantage of the festive Christmas season, offering baked treats to a large roster of customers who can’t get enough of the Dickson family treats.
 Colin’s Signature Treats, a pop-up shop at their Bon Air Gardens, Arouca, home, serves up freshly baked delights—some created from family ­recipes handed down for generations and some inspired by Dickson’s love for travels fused with the good old Trini traditions, like his signature Alaskan salmon pastelles, his granny’s recipe for ponche de creme, his gluten-free recipes and various breads and fruit cakes.
 Dickson’s support for his Christmas goodies spans the globe. In fact, it has been so tremendous that the seafarer turned baker plans on opening a store- front bakery in the first quarter of 2021.
 “I locked myself in my room and was out of it. I applied for jobs in Trinidad with no success, not even an acknowledgement of receipt of my resume. I felt like crap. Every time I told my mother I was depressed, she told me ‘that word does not exist in your vocabulary’.
 “I miss the ocean immensely. Words cannot express. I love my job, I love my people, I love my fellow officers and crew. Yacht life is way different from big ship life, and the family vibe is really authentic. At sea, your fellow officers and crew are your family, team and best friends. We depend on each other.
 “When I received a memo from work in November, advising that cruise operations will no longer resume January 2, it is now pushed to April and May, I was distraught. At that moment, I said ‘God, I give up! You take control and let your will be done.’ Oh boy, little did I know that same night I would be awakened to an inner voice at around 3.45 a.m. saying ‘Go back to your origin’. I went straight to my desk and started praying and asking God for direction.
 “My origin was food. It was cooking but, most of all, my passion was for baking. I love creating new things and exploring new flavours and cuisines. My mind just started gushing, it was truly a divine download and I just started writing on my whiteboard and sheets of paper. I have no graphic skills but I created a flyer, and boom! Pop-up bake sale at my home.
 “I told my family and everyone came on board. I shared with my mentor and best friend and they jumped on board and lent immeasurable support. Everything flowed organically. My sister, who lost her job during the pandemic, was my right hand and together we launched out, and simultaneously while doing similar projects, we supported each other’s vision.
 “My brother soon jumped on board with clothing items and we literally have a market place at my family home where guests can come pick up items curbside and whisk through clothing items and purchase as well.
 “As a family, we have truly innovated in this pandemic season using our natural gifts and talents. But to be honest I know it was not me of myself, but divine intervention. I invested my last bit of tangible cash and lunched out, while my sister started at zero dollars and zero cents in order to generate revenue to upkeep her household and pay rent. My advice to folks is release and surrender to God and allow him to direct your path. It’s not easy times, but God’s intention is not for us to suffer,” Dickson said.
 His customers can’t get enough of his signature treats. “My signature item is my fruit cake, which I mimicked from my travels to Funchal, ­Madeira. They make a beautiful fruit cake infused with Madeira wine which is synonymous to their country. It’s not as dark and bitter like our traditional black cake. That was my inspiration and I married the flavours and textures of our tradition and theirs.
 “My Alaskan salmon pastelles are another signature item. It’s just loaded with beautiful textures of salmon and local Trini herbs, and it’s then amped up with gorgeous, zesty lemon flavours from fresh lemon squeezed in to tantalise the taste buds.
 “Cassava pone has always been one of my favourites as a child growing up. So that’s also on the menu. I love freshly baked croissants because it’s what I have for breakfast every morning on the yacht. So, this is a big memory to remind me of my home away from home. I love baking bread, so I do two varieties of infused breads and top off with parmesan or honey and oats.
 “My granny’s recipe for ponche de creme as well is what I use, and of course it was handed down to my mother who then handed down to me, so it’s generations of flavours you taste when you come to Colin’s Signature Treats.
 “I consulted with my executive pastry chef and he sent me some amazing gluten- free recipes to explore as my client is expressing the desire for gluten-free items on my menu, even vegan options.
 “I extend sincere love and gratitude by the amazing response to my products by people from all over Trinidad. Folks have even been requesting that I ship items, but food is pretty tricky to ship.
 “I have been getting orders from the UK, New Zealand, Australia, Philippines, USA, Canada. I am just humbled and grateful. A lot of folks have been requesting my signature spreads, sauces and concierge service. I certainly know I plan on opening a store-front bakery in the first quarter of 2021.
 “My secret is providing exceptional service from the heart and treating each customer with respect and courtesy, and making them feel like an individual. Always give the customer an experience and provide them with more value, and always exceed their expectations. The beauty is seeing people enjoy my food and baked creations. It illuminates my heart. I put my all into whatever I do and it’s no different for baking. So much love goes into the process and that is my secret ingredient.”

In Miller’s world as an intensive care nurse at Frederick Health Hospital during the coronavirus pandemic, the answers to these ever-present questions could mean the difference between good health and critical — potentially even fatal — illness.


  “Now I have a 6-year-old and a 10-year-old at home. They want to hug mommy after she takes a shower. Am I going to give them the virus?” she wonders.


  Being an ICU nurse has given Miller a thick skin. She helps care for the most critically ill patients on a daily basis and comes into contact with death frequently.


  But a pandemic that has picked up considerable steam in recent months has presented challengers to Miller and her colleagues they could have never imagined.


  Recently, a father and a son came to the hospital and had to watch through a window as a member of their family — a wife and a mother — passed away from COVID-19 as a nurse held her hand, Miller said.


  In order to keep the virus from spreading, visitation restrictions imposed by the state have prevented family and friends from being at the bedside of loved ones during their most critical and, perhaps, final moments.


  Last goodbyes are taking place on Zoom, and it often falls upon ICU nurses like Miller to provide that final moment of comfort and support.


  “It’s a lot to carry all of it on your shoulders and have no one there to pick it up because they have stuff on their shoulders,” Miller said.


  For more than two weeks, daily coronavirus cases have surpassed 2,000 in Maryland and 100 in Frederick County.


  As a result, hospitals across the state, including FHH, are being stretched to their limit.


  On Dec. 11, there were more coronavirus patients at FHH (62) than at any other point during the pandemic, and more than half of the patients in the hospitals 19-bed ICU unit were being treated for COVID-19.


  In her conversations with fellow ICU nurses, Miller is hearing more of them say, “I am not OK.”


  Then she took it a step further.


  “We are not OK,” she said. “There is not enough support.”


  Cheryl Cioffi, the senior vice president, chief operating officer and chief nursing officer for FHH, said in a recent interview the hospital was closely monitoring staff levels and making sure that everyone that worked there felt supported. Some nurses were being placed on teams to help manage workloads, while others were being trained to help in other areas.


  Still, the nature of the work can feel unrelenting, both physically and emotionally. Some in the ICU are working 16-hour shifts to make up for the shortfalls. The burnout factor is real, Miller says.


  “It’s nobody’s fault,” she said. “You can’t pull nurses out of thin air. A doctor is only one physician.”


  As FHH began vaccinating some of its front-line health care workers Thursday afternoon, Tom Kleinhanzl, the president and CEO at FHH, praised the work of his ICU team.


  “I can’t thank them enough,” he said. “They have done a tremendous job caring for this community. They are being resilient. They are hanging in there. It’s been a long process. Let’s hope this [vaccine] is beginning to getting to other side of this.”

He said this while presiding over a meeting at Punjab Cooperatives Liquidation Board (PCLB) office on Friday. "The Punjab government will enact the necessary legislations to remove the barriers and enhance performance of PCLB."


  The meeting reviewed the performance and problems of the PCLB in detail. He said that Punjab Chief Minister Usman Bazdar has directed that effective steps be taken to recover government land from illegal occupants.


  He directed the chairman to take all possible steps for recovery of outstanding loans, the report of which should also be sent to him every week. He also directed that the process of transparent auction of litigation-free properties be started immediately.


  Earlier, in a briefing given by Chairman Board Tariq Mahmood Javed and other officers, it was informed that the board is receiving an annual rent of Rs 60 m for its properties across the province while out of the total loans of Rs 6 billion, Rs 4 billion are still pending. The chairman also said that out of the 297 properties of the board, 110 are available for immediate auction while the remaining properties are subject to court cases.


  7,000 tons of waste lifted: Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC) started picking waste with ordinary tractor-trolleys on Friday. The waste lifting process was on the halt for the past many days due to strike of sanitary workers.


  On Friday, Imran Ali Sultan, LWMC’s CEO himself remained in field and monitored all operations. He directed all the staff to remain in field till the successful completion of zero waste operation in every nook and corner of the city. The Sunday holiday of all the officers and workers has also been cancelled. CEO LWMC stated that maintaining cleanliness in the city is the top priority and LWMC has cleared mostly points of the city. Till now more than 7000 tons of waste has been lifted during the ongoing operation, he added.


  Spokesperson LWMC stated that citizens should also participate and play their role in proper disposal of solid waste whereas they can always dial LWMC helpline 1139 for their waste-related complaints or can use mobile-based application Clean Lahore.

A Dec. 12 letter stated, "If even one person's death can be prevented by taking strict precautions then we take those precautions, no questions asked." This is consistent with ethical codes where the first and foremost responsibility is to the public welfare, as followed by many professions.


   


  Imagine the outcry if a business stated, "Our product has a dangerous defect, but it only impacts 4.4 percent of the population, and only 0.012 percent of the population will die as a result. All deaths are tragic, but this percent is not very high. The profits of our owners or shareholders, and the jobs of our employees, depend on our continued production of this product."


   


  I do disagree with one point in the Dec. 12 letter, "The point [that an earlier letter writer on Dec. 10] is making about the efficacy of a stringent lockdown of eating establishments may be valid." This referred to a statement that Indiana had fewer pandemic cases and deaths compared to population than Michigan.


   


  That earlier letter writer used data over the entire pandemic, not current data. The Brown University School of Public Health website shows a current (as of Dec. 10) seven-day moving average of cases per 100,000 people of 96.7 for Indiana, but only 63.2 for Michigan. It is factually false that Indiana currently has a lower rate of cases than Michigan.

 Checkpoint locations are chosen based on a history of DUI crashes and arrests. The primary purpose of checkpoints is not to make arrests, but to promote public safety by deterring drivers from driving impaired, police said.
 During the checkpoint, officers will look for signs that drivers are under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs.
 Funding for this program was provided by a grant from the California Office of Traffic Safety, through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
 \----- IN ADDITION, every day through New Year's Day, the Fontana P.D. will have officers on patrol looking for drivers suspected of being under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs. This enforcement effort is part of a national campaign, Driver Sober or Get Pulled Over, intended to show zero tolerance for drunk driving and keep roads safe.
 “This year has been challenging and difficult on all of us,” Sergeant David Lally said. “The last thing we need is more heartbreak and tragedy. Make the right choice by not driving impaired so everyone can have a safe holiday.”
 Due to COVID-19, the state of California is asking residents to avoid large gatherings for the holidays to mitigate the spread of the virus.

It's a sad commentary on our times that so many Christians are so ignorant of evil. It makes them easy targets of evil people. Apparently, some pastors measure the success of their church by the number of people attending every Sunday (pre-COVID, at least). I guess these pastors don't want their students moving on from kindergarten. They would prefer people just dropped a check in the collection plate, practice the rules preached upon each Sunday and pray for missions every once in a while. Perhaps such leadership doesn't understand that there is a point in every believer's life when God comes by and whispers, "I'd like to take you on as a student. Come with Me!"

Firefighters can't accomplish their tasks, their jobs remotely. Neither can police officers. Doctors, nurses, ambulance personnel, and paramedics can't do their job of saving your life remotely.
 Neither can the church of Jesus Christ. That's not God's way. That's not the Jesus Way of doing things.
 Paul so beautifully laid it out in Romans 8: God went for the jugular when he sent his own son. He didn't deal with the problem as something remote and unimportant. In his son, Jesus, he personally took on the human condition, entered the disordered mess of struggling humanity in order to set it right once and for all. (vv. 3-4, MSG)
 Those young men and women in the Sahara Desert training center didn't merely listen to what I was saying, they listened to God's word, the Bible. And then they walked out the door and scattered into the places of his appointment.
 Many walked into danger.
 Some of them died in Sudan, while others continue to press forward in planting churches and spreading the Good News everywhere they can. Some of them started an Arabic Language Bible college. Others have launched training centers, prayer movements, and micro-business opportunities for missions.
 There is more--so much more--but I don't have the space to tell you how they have moved out, stepping into places I will probably never see, from Morocco to Syria and beyond.
 They went out and never looked back.
 And neither did the Father, when he sent his son, Jesus, to us. He couldn't do it remotely. For our sake, he had to come. He had to be here. God with us.
 And that's what Christmas is all about.

The Indian cricket team under Virat Kohli faced its worst hour of embarrassment while collapsing to its lowest Test score of 36 as a rampaging Australia cruised to an emphatic eight wicket victory inside two and half days in the opening Day Night Test here on Saturday. There were no demons in the pitch but Josh Hazlewood 5 3 8 5 and Patrick Cummins 10.2 4 21 4 displayed fast bowling of highest quality, the impact of which will be far reaching with three more Tests to go. India s earlier lowest score was 42 at the Lord s in 1974 against England, known in Indian cricket parlance as the Summer of 42 . Saturday s total was also the lowest score in the brief history of D N Tests and the joint fifth lowest overall. The easy target of 90 runs was achieved by the home side in only 21 overs without much fuss. They only lost Matthew Wade 33 and Marnus Labuschagne 6 in pursuit of the easy goal and in the process, opener Joe Burns 51 got a confidence boosting half century. India have now lost three successive Tests well inside three days with two being in New Zealand earlier this year. To make matters worse for the visitors, star pacer Mohammed Shami s series could well be over due to a wrist injury from a short ball from Pat Cummins, which could potentially be a fracture. Shami could not continue and the Indian innings was terminated at 36 for 9 in 21.2 overs. The likes of Sunil Gavaskar and the late Ajit Wadekar had long carried the baggage of that English Summer, inarguably one of the worst in the annals of Indian cricket. It will now be replaced by the Summer of 36 . Call it irony, but just like Gavaskar then, a modern day great like Virat Kohli will have this bit of avoidable history in his legacy, a day when one could hardly figure out what went wrong. At one stage, India were reduced to 26 for 8 and looked like equalling the lowest ever Test score 26 by New Zealand vs England but Hanuma Vihari s boundary helped them evade entry into the dark pages of cricketing history. The Indian batting was completely exposed by the extra bounce generated by Australian pacers, who bowled every delivery on the off middle channel after landing on the seam. In an inexplicable collapse, India s much vaunted batsmen fell like nine pins with not a single one able to reach double figures. Once nightwatchman Jasprit Bumrah 2 was out in the first over, Hazlewood and Cummins 10.2 4 21 4 , literally decimated the tourists and also caused lasting damage to their pride. The likes of Mayank Agarwal 9 , Cheteshwar Pujara 0 and Ajinkya Rahane 0 were all out in similar fashion. All the deliveries were almost identical, angled in, which forced the batsmen to jab at them and just bounced a wee bit more. They deviated a shade taking outside edges to Tim Paine behind the stumps. Kohli 4 was dismissed in the manner he used to get out in England back in 2014, trying to drive a delivery on the fifth stump and caught at gully. To sum it up, the Indian batsmen failed to factor in the pitch suddenly becoming more livelier with extra bounce. The two Australian pacers bowled deliveries that the visiting batsmen had to play and the ultra defensive mindset that they carried from the first innings didn t help their cause. Never has a Test match changed so dramatically in an hour s play like it did at the Adelaide Oval on Saturday. Worse, a collapse like this could effect the performance in the next Test match at the MCG, beginning December 26, and not to forget they won t have a Kohli to look up to as he would be on paternity leave. Ajinkya Rahane, the captain in waiting, has been in wretched form for the longest time and one would prefer to discount his hundred against a below par West Indies attack in the interim. Even the South Africa attack at home wasn t the best in the business. Prithvi Shaw s confidence is in shambles in terms of both technique and temperament. Mayank Agarwal, with that pronounced back lift and a dodgy technique against deliveries with extra bounce, will also have his share problems. Cheteshwar Pujara s defensive batting worked well in 2018 but this time, there is propensity to get stuck as Shane Warne, during commentary, pointed out at his inability to rotate the strike. As much as one romanticises that 43 off 160 balls as a display of pristine Test cricket but that lack of runs in the first two sessions also came back to bite India hard. The sequence 4, 9, 2, 0, 4, 0, 8, 4, 0, 4, and 1 on the scorecard will rankle the fans but more so this team, for the longest time.

With medics worried that Evelyn could have another cardiac event at any moment, it was deemed too risky to send her home.
 Instead, she was kept in hospital for 17 days, during which time she had surgery to fit her with an internal defibrillator – a device placed under the skin that monitors heart rate and corrects abnormal rhythms.
 “That operation was the hardest thing I have ever had to go through,” said Emma. “The doctors were fantastic and talked us through what would happen – but seeing that there was a risk of death on the consent form I had to sign made it very real.”
 “The surgeons said that Evelyn was the smallest person they had given a defibrillator to,” she added. “When she came back round, she was hooked up to a ventilator, which was horrible to see.

The Duchess of Sussex brought privacy and data protection claims against the Splash News and Picture Agency in March over the long-lens photographs. A lawyer for the American former television actress, who married Prince Harry in 2018, said Splash UK went into administration after the claim was issued and served.


  Judge Matthew Nicklin told the hearing: "In light of the administration, the parties have agreed to settle the claim against Splash UK. "The administrators of Splash UK have undertaken that, should the entity come out of administration, Splash UK will not take any photographs of the duke and duchess or their son in the future."


  The photographs were taken on January 20 this year, showing Markle walking with Archie in a baby sling, and her two dogs, in Horth Hill Regional Park on Vancouver Island.


  Her lawyer, Jenny Afia, said a Splash photographer had made a "full reconnaissance inspection" of the house where they were staying, and put his camera over the fence to take pictures.


  Law firm Schillings said the settlement was "a clear signal that unlawful, invasive and intrusive paparazzi behaviour will not be tolerated". A separate but similar claim against Splash US is also before the British courts, it added. The claim, brought by Markle on her behalf, and the couple for Archie, is one of several by the duke and duchess against media groups since they stepped down from the royal frontline.

  # Hobbled Hernandez helps Patriots rally past Eagles


  By Michael Smith


  The Examiner


  Truman senior Runey Hernandez wasn’t quite himself in Friday’s boys basketball contest against Grain Valley.


  That’s because he hadn’t practiced all week because of an ankle injury. He was playing at less than 100 percent against the Eagles, but that didn’t stop him from making an impact when it mattered most.


  After Truman took a 50-49 lead with just under a minute left, Hernandez took a crucial charge to give his team the ball back after Grain Valley guard Jayden Yung barreled into him in the paint. He also made four critical free throws in the final minute to help the Patriots escape with a 56-51 Suburban Middle Six win on the road.


  “He has a pretty bad ankle injury, so he’s playing on one leg tonight,” Truman coach Rod Briggs said of Hernandez. “He’s hurt pretty good. He toughed it out.”


  Hernandez’s teammates lauded him for his gutsy play.


  “He has a lot of heart to keep coming out here and playing hard night in and night out,” Truman senior Najee Williams said. “He came up clutch for us and we needed that.”


  Added Truman senior Max Black: “That’s the leader Runey is. He will do anything for the team. He’s a dog.”


  Hernandez said he’s looking forward to seeing Black’s dad, who is the team’s chiropractor.


  “The ankle is definitely swollen, but we will see Mr. Black this weekend for sure,” said Hernandez, who finished with eight points. “He’s definitely going to work my ankle out.


  “I just wanted to do whatever I could for the team. I am blessed to be around these guys.”


  Truman (5-1, 1-0 Middle Six) trailed 35-32 in the fourth quarter, and Grain Valley started the period on a 8-3 run, capped by a pair of free throws from senior Jayden Yung and one free throw from senior Keeton Maxon. That gave the Eagles a 42-34 advantage, the Eagles’ biggest lead of the game.


  However, a 3-pointer from Black, a driving layup from senior guard Quincy Scott and a free throw from Hernandez pulled Truman within 43-41.


  Grain Valley then went on a 4-0 spurt following a Maxon layup on the press break and a fast break bucket from senior guard John Haywood pushed the Eagles’ lead to 47-41.


  Black wouldn’t let Truman go away as he answered with a 3-pointer to make it 47-44. Haywood made 1 of 2 free throws on the following possession to make it 48-44.


  After three missed shots and three offensive rebounds, Williams, who finished with a team-high 21 points and six rebounds, made a putback and was fouled. He sank the ensuing free throw to narrow the gap to 48-47 late in the quarter.


  Yung, who finished with 10 points, was fouled with a little more than 1 minute left and made 1 of 2 free throws to extend the lead to 49-47.


  Black delivered in the clutch again when he received a pass from DeAnjalo Holman and nailed a 3-pointer from the right wing to put the Patriots up for good.


  “I am blessed to have a team that’s confident in me,” said Black, who finished with 11 points. “I was not playing well the first three quarters. I was not making my shots, but the guys didn’t yell at me and they just let me keep shooting.”


  Hernandez then drew the key charge and made two free throws after he was fouled on the inbound pass with 25 seconds left. Grain Valley senior Cole Keller, who had a team-high 21 points and 14 rebounds, made a driving layup to cut it to one.


  Maxon shoved Hernandez in the back on an inbound pass. The officials called an intentional foul and Hernandez made both of his free throws for a 54-51 lead for the Patriots, who got the ball back.


  Maddux Bristow and Griffen Hernandez each made 2 of 2 free throws to ice it. Meanwhile Grain Valley turned the ball over on a double dribble call and missed a long 3-point try on its final two possessions.


  “We’re young and experienced,” Grain Valley coach Andy Herbert said after his team fell to 1-3 and 0-1 in the conference. “We just have to learn from it. It’s the process of learning how to win a game. We did more things right than we did wrong. It’s just the things we did wrong happened at unfortunate times.”


  Keller scored 10 points in the first period to help the Eagles take a 13-7 lead. Williams made his presence felt in the second period by scoring 11 points – nine of which came from behind the arc – pushing Truman ahead 28-22 at halftime.


  Then a strong defensive effort for Grain Valley helped it turn the tables in the third. The Eagles held the Patriots to 1-for-11 shooting from the floor and forced five turnovers as Grain Valley took a three-point lead into the fourth.

14 people were injured when a speeding truck going to Jewar from Greater Noida lost balance, hit the divider, and rammed into an oncoming UP roadways bus on the other side of the carriage in Dankaur, Greater Noida late Friday night at around 11.30 pm. The roadways bus belonging to Shikohabad depot was coming from Lucknow and going to Delhi via Agra and Greater Noida. There were 40-45 passengers on board when the accident took place.
 Anil Kumar Pandey, station house officer (SHO) Dankaur police station, said that the accident took place at about 12.7 km from the zero point in Greater Noida.
 "It appears the truck driver slept on the wheel and lost balance of the vehicle. The truck hit the divider first before crashing into the roadways bus on the other side," he said. The truck driver and the helper were also injured in the accident.

 The bus passengers informed the police and a team from Dankaur police station and a team of Yamuna expressway patrol reached the spot and rescued the victims. Pandey said five of the 14 injured passengers had received serious injuries. The victims have been admitted to Kailash hospital in Greater Noida.
 The accident led to a traffic jam on the expressway for about half an hour. However, the police personnel placed barricades and signalled other vehicles to stop to avoid a pile up. The police team later removed the two damaged vehicles from the spot and cleared the road.
 The passengers, who escaped unhurt, boarded other buses and left the spot while some others were picked up by their friends and relatives from the accident spot.
