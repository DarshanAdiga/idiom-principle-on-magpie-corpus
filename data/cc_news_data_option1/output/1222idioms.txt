Dua Lipa, “Future Nostalgia”: While most musicians have scraped concert plans and changed album release dates due to the rapidly spreading coronavirus, Dua Lipa has moved up the date to her anticipated sophomore project.

This government will have seen the national press condemning ISS for causing a cleaners walkout at Lewisham hospital as we are on the midst of a highly contagious pandemic. Workers and the public will therefore have no confidence in ISS delivering safe and effective services within the ExCeL centre.'                  The first 500 beds at the 4,000-bed Nightingale Hospital are expected to be operational next week according to a Number 10 spokesman.                   Officials are considering setting up field hospitals in other sites across the UK to boost intensive care demand as the coronavirus outbreak strains the NHS.                  The Army confirmed the SEC in Glasgow was one potential site. Temporary facilities in Birmingham and Manchester are also believed to be under consideration as the health service braces for Covid-19's peak.                   The Prime Minister's official spokesman also indicated that other sites were being considered when asked about potential field hospitals in Birmingham and Manchester.                  'The current focus is on getting the ExCel centre up and running as the NHS Nightingale Hospital,' he said.                  'But NHS England is actively preparing for a number of scenarios as the outbreak continues and is working with clinicians and teams of military planners around the country.'                  Scotland's chief medical officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, separately said numerous sites were being considered north of the border with the nation 'on the cusp of that rapid escalation'.                  An Army spokesman confirmed the SEC in Glasgow was one of the sites under consideration as a temporary NHS hospital in Scotland.                  Bosses at the National Exhibition Centre near Birmingham, which has 18 exhibition halls, have said they 'stand ready' to aid the NHS in the coronavirus fight.

Bloomberg) -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau unveiled sweeping measures on Friday to protect Canada's small businesses from the economic fallout of the coronavirus which is pushing the country into a recession.
 The measures include a sharp increase in wage subsidies, more availability of loans through banks and credit funding agencies, and more tax deferrals for business. Trudeau praised the Bank of Canada for its measures earlier Friday, in which the central bank began a program of large-scale asset purchases for the first time and lowered its policy rate to the near zero.
 "We know that for small storefront businesses, they're struggling with cash flow right now," Trudeau said at a press conference outside his residence in Ottawa. "It's hard to raise money and make money in this climate."
 Banks are working with the government to offer C$40,000 ($28,5000) loans to certain businesses, which will be guaranteed by Ottawa. All loans will be interest free for the first year and up to C$10,000 can be forgiven if certain conditions are met, Trudeau said, adding the government has increased the wage subsidy program to 75% for small businesses, up from the 10% subsidy announced last week.
 The government will also increase access to credit to help inject cash into small and medium sized businesses with an additional C$12.5 billion to Export Development Canada and the Business Development Bank Canada.
 "This means that businesses will be able to apply for a guaranteed loan when they go to their financial institutions to get help as they weather the impacts from Covid-19," Trudeau told reporters.
 Supporting Actions
 Trudeau, who said he expects more details of the measures to be revealed by Monday, also praised the Bank of Canada's rate cut to 0.25% and other policy measures on Friday morning.
 "I'm pleased with the supporting actions taken by the Bank of Canada this morning," Trudeau said. "Monetary policy is very important, but as the governor of the bank has repeatedly said, the most important thing we can do to help people and the economy in this crisis is for the government to take strong fiscal action."
 Canada's Finance Minister Bill Morneau and Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz will hold a press conference at 1 p.m. Friday in Ottawa.
 The following is a list of new measures taken by the federal government:
 Government will cover 75% of wages for affected workers. This figure represents an increase from the 10% subsidy announced last weekAnnounces expansion of more credit through Export Development Canada and Business Development Canada totaling extra C$12.5 billionSales taxes and import duty payments to be deferred until June, worth about C$30 billionCreation of Canada Emergency Business Account through banks, which can extend C$40K in loans guaranteed by government to qualifying businesses. Loans are interest free for 1st year, C$10k is forgivable under certain conditions

Sure, GOI cannot close down India indefinitely. But being unrealistic about resolution timelines only pushes everything into the realm of quackery and fake anti-carona medicines peddled on the Net while leaving the deeper dilemmas of economic shutdown unaddressed. And all this even as cities are emptying of contract/daily wage labourers, who are streaming back to their distant villages, with those staying on along with their families are left without livelihood and wondering where their next meal was coming from. In this situation for the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to announce the capitalisation of a spate of welfare schemes and direct transfer programmes of money, etc. is very good. But such policy diversions assume that every last person in the country is so covered, which clearly is not the case. So even as the government and industry struggle to come up with large-scale economic remedies for the "wretched of the earth" (Franz Fanon's phrase for the abjectly poor) that deliver in the short term, problems of the here and now still demand immediate answers.

The phone footy is all-time, if you search the internet hard enough… it is probably somewhere out there. Rumor has it that Zeb has an iPhone edit ready to drop, but we will just have to wait and see. But as Jesse said on more than one occasion… we were there to snowboard. So we left for Loon a little after 9am.

"This is a challenging business environment, and we are thoughtfully managing through the COVID-19 pandemic to maintain business continuity," said Ms. Savage. "Rail transportation in North America has been deemed critical by the United States government to moving essential goods and commodities to market, and we are taking necessary precautions to protect our thousands of employees while serving the customers that rely on us. Until we have greater visibility into the impact of COVID-19 on the North American economy and the significant price declines in the global crude oil market, we believe it is prudent to withdraw our annual guidance. However, Trinity remains committed to the previously announced $25 million to $30 million SE&A cost reduction target for 2020 and expects additional savings over time. We anticipate providing an update on our business and financial outlook to investors in conjunction with our first quarter earnings results. While we are not able to estimate the ultimate impact of COVID-19 and the decline in crude oil prices on demand for railcars and our businesses at this time, we anticipate that these events will have a negative and potentially material impact on our financial performance in the near term."

 Little did we know that the pipe session would be the last time we strapped in. At dinner that night (March 12), we got word that the last stop was to be cancelled due to the COVID-19 spread. It was still before any government sanctioned shutdowns, but we all wanted to err on the side of caution. Tickets were changed immediately, and the crew went their separate ways.
 At the time, with all the uncertainty, it was a weird way to end a trip… but as the news gets more and more serious every day, we are all thankful to have our health and if it truly is the end of the season, at least ending it on such a high note. The group chat is still going, and no one has any symptoms, although most of us get sick when we think of the smell of the bus. We have all been self-quarantining since we left, and are just about to pass the two- week window. Huge thanks to Red Bull and all the resorts for making this possible, and for handling the end of the trip responsibly. We hope everyone stays safe and healthy so we can pick up next year right where we left off… but until then, at least we have this video to watch. _(More photos below.)_

Just when you should be looking forward to releasing your new youth team, Burke's season has stopped at the worst possible time.
 "We are following all protocols at the moment and it is working well," Burke said.
 "About 95 percent of the staff has been full time; we have had a partner with a cough who has isolated herself.
 "You still have to exercise the horses, you can't let them. It's a terrible time of year for it to happen, and it's very frustrating."
 "Like most coaches, we are selfishly thinking about what we are missing. But everyone is in the same boat, not that Middleham is closed and everyone else is open or vice versa, (so) you just have to let's do it.
 "Hopefully there will be some improvement in the coming weeks and there will be some light at the end of the tunnel. Whether it is May 1 or June 1, we would like a date to target.
 "Planning the race for the flat season must be a nightmare. The last race schedule has arrived and the first day was May 1, so I guess right now they are preparing for that."
 "The next two weeks will be vitally important, not from a career perspective, but from across the country."
 Burke hoped to lead the promising Lord Of The Lodge in a Guineas trial before a crack in the Classic, but when, or even if that will take place, is now up in the air.
 He added: "For the past 10 days, we have not galloped any horses, but they have all galloped, and that is why we need some kind of clarity. If we are going to compete in May, they must be working from next week onwards.
 "Lord Of The Lodge is in great shape, as is the rest of the chain, but I'm trying not to think about what we're missing."
 "If we can keep them in good shape and keep them healthy, we will be in a good position every time we arrive."
 "I'm almost 57 now and I've always been told when the sun was shining this time of year that the viruses would be missing. Apparently not this one."
 Hammond, who celebrated his first Grade One hit this season when Cornerstone Lad won the Fighting Fifth Hurdle, feels for those like Burke, who were stopped from the season before it started.
 "I think we are ticking here," he said.
 "We are in the process of finishing almost all of our bridges, most of them have had a good season."
 "We'll have a weird summer jumper and some flat horses to keep going. We only have about a dozen for the flat.
 "You feel about the flat guys, you really know that. No one knows what's going to happen in the future, we really don't. We just have to see what's going on across the country and see how bad this gets."
 "It seems strange that we were in Cheltenham two weeks ago, and in the meantime, I have been to Koh Samui and have returned. We returned on Tuesday and Wednesday I was prohibited from entering and leaving all flights."
 "The social distancing in our yard is working well. The staff is listening to the advice given, and let's be honest, nobody wants to get this virus, right?

 VANCOUVER — Boston Pizza International Inc. is temporarily laying off approximately half of its 192 corporate staff across its three offices in Canada.
 The company says the cuts are due to a significant decline in business caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

 The company says virtually all of its nearly 400 independently and locally owned restaurants have had to make similar decisions to layoff staff as they adjust to take out and delivery only.
 It says franchisees in some locations have chosen to temporarily close altogether.

 “It’s incredible to receive all of the honors on and off the court Princeton is especially known for their hard work in the classroom and on the court,” said Laabs on being named to the team. Miller also shared that “it really means a lot” to the senior. “The ball stops bouncing for everyone at some point, so being able to succeed in other areas is very beneficial,” explained Miller.
 Head coach Brett Cloutier was proud of the two for being named to the team. “It’s a great honor for them to get recognized for their excellence on the basketball court and in the classroom. The two were great for us all season and even better in the classroom,” said Cloutier.
 Laabs took pride in being named to the team and being able to do it with not just his teammate, but one of his friends, meant even more. “Cody and I do a little bit of everything together, from going to the gym to late night study sessions, to endless hours of film… It’s awesome to get this honor with not only a teammate but a lifelong friend,” said Laabs.
 Both Laabs and Miller were apart of two 7AAA Championship teams and were a part of the team that snapped an 87-year state tournament drought for the Tigers.
 Laabs will attend St. John’s in Collegeville next year, where he plans on studying business management, while Miller will study Health Sciences at Valley City State University with hopes to become an orthodontist. Both will continue their basketball careers at the collegiate level.

The second development, and one likely to have the greater long-term impact, is the budget cuts implemented by the Winchester School Board at its meeting on March 19. The board had proposed a $12.8 million budget for the upcoming 2020-21 school year, but voters at the school deliberative session on Feb. 6 reduced the figure to go on the school warrant by 12.5 percent. In response, the board warned that draconian cuts would be necessary and detailed the steps it said it would be forced to take if the amended budget passed. This did not deter district voters, and at the polls on March 10 they approved the reduced $11.3 million budget.
 Some advocating for the reduced budget accused the school board of scare tactics in outlining before the district vote what the cuts would be. But last week it made good on its word and approved almost the same cuts it had previously projected. Facing mounting tuition costs for students attending Keene High School and other already locked-in increases beyond its control, the board was left with limited discretionary spending options to cut. The resulting steps: reducing kindergarten to half-day, eliminating transportation for high school students to Keene as well as for kids living within 2 miles of Winchester School, axing funding for athletic programs and field trips, and eliminating nearly a quarter of the workforce.
 Extreme measures, indeed. Advocates for the budget reduction justified it as a return to the spending level approved in 2017 because the district’s test scores hadn’t improved in the three years since — and because taxpayers were tapped out and couldn’t afford the proposed budget. Time will tell whether the cuts in early education and other support will limit the district’s ability to increase test scores or, worse, serve to disadvantage Winchester’s schoolkids. As for the latter justification, board Chairwoman Lindseigh Picard summed it up when she blamed the New Hampshire public school-funding system for pitting taxpayers strapped by an unfair property tax burden against the needs of students. “Until New Hampshire figures this out,” she said, “this divide will continue.”

Just a couple of Outlaws. Mountain Creek, NJ.
 Made up or not, (definitely made up) the saying rang true. For the next couple days, we hit Stratton, Killington and Jay Peak, VT. The only thing that was bad was the smell on the bus. Semi-dehydrated urine isn’t exactly a scent you would want for a candle. We kept chugging, but the smell didn’t get much better until we left Vermont. And that is not a knock on Vermont, we just didn’t empty the tank until we hit New Hampshire. But… back to the trip. Stratton started off a bit icy, though by the end of the day the park turned pristine as Jesse and Sean traded tricks on a multitude of rails. It is easy to see why the U.S. Open was held there for so many years… the mountain is a blast and so is the town.

 On the last night before the Spanish state of emergency went into effect, in the only restaurant in the village atop the narrow valley, people gathered for a birthday party.
 The television was blasting scenes of coronavirus panic in Madrid, but nobody was paying attention to it, or the slow roll of the impending crisis.
 Aside from that wall-mounted television, Comidas Caseras de Carmen (Carmen's Homemade Food), felt like an eatery from a different century. As soon as you take a seat, Carmen sets down a large flask of wine and a pitcher of water, and then asks what you want to drink. Her only other question is what kind of meat.
 Beyond that the menu is set. First comes a mound of lettuce topped with fresh raw veggies and drizzled with pomegranate dressing. Then, a steaming vat of soup and a stack of bowls. You ladle the soup and pass around the bowls.
 The soup changes daily. In my three visits I had cocido de hinojos, made with fennel and white bean; sopa de mariscos, a seafood soup thick with mussels, clams, squid and fish; and salmorejo, a cold, pureed gazpacho.
 After the soup comes a skillet of papas alins, potatoes cooked in sherry and olive oil. Decadently soft and impregnated with oil, they are so incredibly edible that the average diner waves the white flag before the skillet is half empty if they don't pace themselves.
 Then come the meats. The rabbit tastes like chicken. The chicken is cooked in a Dijon turmeric sauce. The goat is in stew form, and includes pieces of liver. My favorite was the lamb, salted and grilled. I washed down the melted fat with big gulps of wine from the bottomless flask.
 Finally comes dessert, usually natillas -- a type of Spanish flan with a cookie on top -- or avocado mousse, which tastes like vanilla custard with your eyes closed. Anyone who wants could have an espresso with dessert.
 My last taste of Carmen's homemade food was takeout that we ate on our rooftop terrace in the hamlet of Guajar-Faraguit, just down the valley from Carmen's. She had packed my food in Tupperware, and my wine filled a plastic liter soda bottle. When I returned the next night to bring back the dishes, the restaurant seemed more festive than usual, and her sister was more dressed up. Some motorcycles roared to a stop outside, and several guests ran out, returning with boxes. An octopus-like cake holder appeared, and within moments each arm held a cake.
 The birthday girl posed with each guest in front of the ornate cake rack. All the while, on the screen behind them, the news blasted updates of the impending lockdown. As she kissed her mother, I hoped I wasn't witnessing a kiss of death.
 The next time I drove by Carmen's, it was shuttered. The villages are now silent, but this eerie silence is comforting. Spain does not want to go the way of Italy with COVID-19, and the citizens and authorities are taking it seriously. During our stay there in March, we were stopped by the police while on a grocery run. People kept their distance on the near-empty sidewalks as if scared of being mugged. One person at a time was allowed in each shop. I had my money sprayed with bleach after paying. Many locals were waiting out the epidemic in their mountain huts, next to olive groves where there is always work to do.
 Luckily, nobody stopped us from hiking in the mountains, and I stayed busy in the kitchen trying to recreate Carmen's culinary magic. I will leave you with the potato recipe for now. This summer, when it's hot, I'll drop the avocado mousse and salmorejo recipes. And when fennel is available, and nobody knows what to do with it, I'll give you the recipe for cocido de hinojas.
 This is my version of papas alins and not the official one, or Carmen's. I started making it my way because I hadn't realized it's usually made with sherry, which I couldn't find in the valley. But like the rest of Spain, and the rest of the world, we adjust and improvise when we have to. You can find the official version of this dish online, but my family has fallen in love with mine.
 Papas Alins in the time of COVID-19   Makes 2 servings   • 1 pound potatoes, sliced about ½-inch thick   • 1 cup olive oil   • 4 whole cloves garlic   • 1/2 green bell pepper, sliced   • 1/2 sweet red pepper, sliced   • Optional extras: olives, carrot slices
 Heat the oil on low/medium, add the potatoes, and let them slowly poach at a gentle simmer. If they stick above the oil a bit it's OK, because soon they will soften, shrink and sink.
 Unlike with fries, where sogginess means failure, here we want the oil to impregnate the soft potatoes. But if you cook them long enough a crust will form that serves to hold in the flavored oils. It's not authentic, but it's a nice touch.
 After about 10 minutes add the peppers, garlic and any other veggies you might care to. Move things around so the new veggies are submerged, and keep simmering until the peppers shrink and the air smells like a fragrant mix of potatoes and peppers. Strain the oil and serve.

La situacion de lo que era hasta el jueves "Kajol Lavan" no esta totalmente clara. Si es evidente que Gantz se va con Netanyahu, pero no hay certeza acerca de cuantos diputados iran con el. De los 33 escaños obtenidos por Kajol Lavan en las elecciones del 2 de marzo, 15 eran de la lista original de Gantz, Josen LeIsrael y los restantes 18, de Yesh Atid y Telem. Pero ahora surgen complicaciones. Por un lado, la recien mencionada "rebelion" de Gadir Mreeh, que no se va con Gantz. Y por otro, en la parte de Kajol Lavan que queda ahora en la oposicion, dos de  sus diputados electos (Yoaz Hendel y Zvi Hauser, que se sumaron en su momento a Telem de Yaalon), apoyan la ida de Gantz al gobierno de Netanyahu, pero no es seguro que desde un punto de vista legal, puedan escindirse y formar otra faccion que le de su apoyo.

Italy's coronavirus epidemic could peak in the next few days, experts said Friday, but regional authorities warned the crisis was far from over, as four more frontline doctors died.
 The national health institute (ISS) cautiously suggested lockdown measures to curb the spread of the disease -- which has claimed over 8,100 lives and infected some 80,000 people -- may soon bear fruit.
 "I want to be clear on one point. We have not peaked yet," the institute's head Silvio Brusaferro said.
 "There are signs of a slowdown, which makes us believe that we are close, we could peak in the next few days."
 But virologist Fabrizio Pregliasco warned that would not translate into a go- ahead to ease lockdown measures.
 The slight slowing in case numbers "should strengthen our desire to continue. We must not drop our guard."
 And Brusaferro said any lifting of strict measures would have to be done with extreme caution.
 "We'll have to take careful measures for some months in order to avoid the epidemic curve rising again," he said.
 Italy's lockdown came into effect nationwide on March 9, extending strict measures put in place earlier across swathes of the north, where the epidemic began.
 Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said last week that the measures taken to close schools, bars and restaurants and restrict movement would have to be prolonged beyond the original end-date of April 3, without specifying until when.
 \- 'Saturation point' -
 The rise in daily deaths on Thursday edged down to the lowest point in the crisis -- 8.8 percent.
 But regional authorities in Italy's hard-hit north warned their hospitals were still under enormous strain.
 "We have reached saturation point in intensive therapy, despite having doubled bed numbers," said the head of the Piedmont region, Alberto Cirio.
 "If this rate does not drop, we risk not being able to make it," he said, while appealing urgently for extra ventilators.
 The number of doctors killed by the virus rose to 44 on Friday, with nearly 6,500 health workers infected, ISS said.
 The latest victim was doctor Annamaria Focarete, 70. One tearful colleague told AdnKronos news agency that "with her fighting spirit she seemed to have beaten it. Then a superinfection got her."
 Military doctors and nurses battling the disease in field hospitals were thanked by Italy's defence minister Lorenzo Guerini, who said they were making the country proud.
 "The battle is still a long one, we have a lot of work to do, but together we will succeed," he said via Skype.
 \- 'More sacrifices needed' -
 He warned, however, that "more sacrifices will be required of you" before the worst was over.
 And fears persisted that case numbers would continue to rise in central and southern Italy despite the lockdown.
 "The gloom is deepening hour by hour. Psychological support for doctors right now is not only necessary, it's indispensable," said surgeon Liberato Aceto from the Santissima Annunziata hospital in Chieti, east of Rome.
 "Conditions are getting increasingly difficult in the areas reserved for COVID-19 patients," he said.
 It was particularly hard not to be able to reassure those gripped by the disease and fearful for their lives.
 The sanitary protective gear worn by doctors obliged to keep their distance as much as possible created "a barrier... an emotional distance", and prevented them from making even the most basic of gestures.
 "We can longer comfort a patient by holding their hand, or reassure them with a pat on the shoulder," he said.

Spring has sprung, the days are getting longer, the weather is getting warmer and the flowers are opening. As a child, I remember early spring as being a riot of color and the air being filled with the sound of birds singing louder as they returned after a cold winter. The air also had a different scent and feel; I guess more humidity returning to the air. Anyway, one knew spring was on its way. It was fun to anticipate when the first signs of brown bushes would explode into color.      As spring approaches, so do some of my favorite flowering shrubs. These early spring flowering plants brighten up the landscape (as well as my mood). I am crazy about some of the new shrubs that flower in March and April, but I cannot forget about the ones that I recall from my childhood. Those that created the nostalgic memories that I cherish.      I was one of five girls and we all walked to school, as did all of our friends. As you walked, you tended to notice more. We passed by houses that had some of the same shrubs in their garden that we had in ours. People in those days did not have very sophisticated bushes; the houses with prettier yards were because of the placement of plants rather than having unusual plant material.      As I think back on what blooming shrubs we had to look forward to, the vibrant yellow flowers of two shrubs come to mind first. Forsythia was in many gardens and a few people had another one named Kerria japonica, or Japanese rose as some called it, which bloomed shortly after the forsythia finished flowering. Both have long arching branches and make a magnificent display of color. Forsythia flowered first and was like a ray of sunshine after the dark days of winter.   The brightly colored flowers that covered the branches opened to a profusion of blooms. Then, not too long after the forsythia turned green with the new foliage, kerria would take center stage. With those long arching branches of brilliant yellow blooms, who could help but enjoy them. Both of these are extremely hardy and so easy to grow that I am sure that is why most homes grew them.      Another old-fashioned shrub is quince. I love quince not only because of my childhood memories but for other reasons too. Most of the ones that I saw growing up had red flowers and many people had this plant somewhere in their yard. The old-fashioned varieties had fruit that resembled apples. They were quite bitter and, as children, we would dare someone to take a bite of the fruit. People would make jam from the bitter, apple looking fruit that would be present in the summer. Today, the quince I grow does not have the large fruit that I remember. I guess that has been bred out of the newer varieties.      Today, I grow three different quince bushes and they are some of my favorite plants, but it is for a different reason. It might not be the prettiest bush when it is not flowering, but I love it because it is easy to force into bloom. I pick branches starting in early December and bring them in the house to open up. I do this about every two weeks after that so that I have a continuous arrangement of them blooming in the house. When I pick the first branches, it takes them longer to open, but after Christmas, it takes less and less time for them to open when I bring them into the house since they are getting closer to the time when they would naturally open.      People think I am so talented for having these flowers in the house, but all it takes is to remember to pick them and bring them in to open up. Try it next winter and you, too, will be rewarded with an abundance of flowers. The branches I do not pick look pretty over a long time in the garden. You can find quince in white, pink, red and an orange-red.      Now, if fragrance is a trait you really want to have in your garden, you cannot beat the fragrance of Daphne and Korean spice viburnum. Daphne is a low growing evergreen shrub with a wonderful fragrance that when brought in the house, will perfume a room.      Korean spice viburnum is a flowering bush that is so aromatic that it fills the air with a lovely scent when in bloom. The buds are pinkish in color and then give way to white flowers. My daughter, Laura, gave me the bush that I presently have and I think of her each time it is in flower. This somewhat larger shrub produces clusters of dainty, pastel-pink buds in late March and the spicy fragrance alone is worth growing this delightful shrub.      I do not know what plants stir up memories of your childhood, maybe you remember some of these jewels. I hope you enjoy spring and the waking up of the trees and shrubs and enjoy those lovely sounds that fill the air. I certainly do.

MONTREAL - The first person in Montreal to die of COVID-19 was a member of the city's Hasidic Jewish community.
 Max Lieberman, with the Council of Hasidic Jews of Quebec, said today the 67-year-old man started exhibiting flu-like symptoms on Sunday and died Wednesday.
 Lieberman says the family had a private, graveside funeral service instead of the more typical large affair given rules forbidding gatherings amid the COVID-19 outbreak.
 He says the community is on edge because many members had participated in large gatherings for a religious holiday, just prior to the introduction of widespread isolation directives by health authorities.

CHICAGO - R&B singer R. Kelly cited the novel coronavirus in asking a federal judge Thursday to free him from a federal jail in Chicago as he awaits trial on child pornography and other charges, a court filing by his lawyers saying scant precautions to stem the spread of the virus behind bars put Kelly's life at risk.
 Sanitizer and even soap is hard to come by in the Metropolitan Correctional Center, with most of its 700 inmates held in small, two-man cells that make the kind of social distancing called for to thwart the transmission of COVID-19 impossible, the filing in U.S. District Court in Chicago says.
 Kelly, 53, faces several dozen counts of state and federal sexual misconduct charges in Illinois, Minnesota and New York, from sexual assault to heading a racketeering scheme aimed at supplying him with girls. The Grammy Award winning singer has denied ever abusing anyone.
 While the MCC barred most visitors on March 13, there are few detectable protocols for screening lawyers, guards and new detainees still entering the facility to check if they might be infected, the filing says. The visiting floor has sanitizer, but a sign next to the single bottle available says, "STAFF ONLY;" and a bathroom on the same floor often has no soap, according to the filing.
 "The health risk to Mr. Kelly, because of his age and existing health issues, especially considering the conditions at the MCC, necessitates his release on bail," it says,
 Thursday's 18-page filing didn’t describe Kelly's health issues, but it said he was within the category of people described as high-risk by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
 "The courts have long recognized that there is no greater necessity than keeping a defendant alive, no matter the charge," the filing says.
 For most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.

English cricket chiefs are considering installing coronavirus checkpoints and isolation units at grounds as a way of restarting the game behind closed doors.
 Last week the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced that no professional cricket would be played before May 28 at the earliest.
 But the ECB is stepping up its planning for a potential resumption of international action with no spectators.
 England's Test series with West Indies is due to start at the Oval on 4 June. Australia and Pakistan are also due to tour during the English summer.
 The ECB's director of special projects Steve Elworthy told the Guardian that such an approach would essentially mean creating a "safe and sterile environment" at grounds.
 "We're mapping out what international matches would look like behind closed doors," he said.
 Referring to the British government's initial advice prior to the current lockdown, he added: "The advice around mass gatherings was 500 people or fewer.
 "That was guided by the potential impact on critical services like paramedics and doctors.
 "You would likely have to work within that number (which would be made up of essential matchday staff). Then you have to think about medical provisions, creating a safe and sterile environment around that venue, so that everyone who comes in is clear.
 "So it's how you test them at the gate, the isolation units that you have to put in. These are considerations we are thinking about."
 The International Cricket Council said on Friday that it was reviewing its options in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 The men's T20 World Cup is scheduled to start in Australia in October.
 The inaugural World Test Championship final is due to take place at Lord's next June, but with qualifying series being postponed and no certainty as to when they will be rescheduled, the showpiece match could be delayed.
 "We continue to undertake a comprehensive business continuity and contingency planning exercise which will allow us to adapt to the rapidly evolving world in which we find ourselves," ICC chief executive Manu Sawhney said on Friday.
 "The ICC management will continue our contingency planning around ICC events and will also work with members to explore all options available to us based on a range of scenarios connected to the pandemic."

Usually, 84-year-old Nonna (Italian for "grandmother") Nerina hosts the highly rated Airbnb Experience, "Handmade pasta with grandma." In the class, Nonna Nerina and her sisters show participants how to prepare pasta with just their hands. But to help protect the spread of coronavirus, all Airbnb Experiences are temporarily paused. While you can't  attend the cooking class  in person right now, you can still learn how to make pasta from Nonna Nerina by tuning in to Nonna Live.

Getting the chance to watch a demo of Gears Tactics completely won me over. I’m very excited to play it for myself and dig deeper into these systems. The game has plenty more worth digging into like how the math works (it barely fudges anything), how much information you get (a lot), and how boss battles change things up.

For example, I’m walking along the street (Condition Yellow). I see a bunch of gang bangers walking toward me on the other side of the street. I focus on them (Condition Orange). I decide if they stay on their side of the street and I stay on mine, we can just pass each other. However, if they cross the street toward me, I will step into one of the stores or businesses on my side to avoid them (Condition Red). If they start something, then it’s game on and I’m already in Condition Red. If they ignore me and keep walking, I can go back to Condition Yellow and be on my way.

Before I go to sleep in a hotel I assemble all the items I need to survive and to get home: Wallet, passport, cash and credit cards, check book, car keys, some extra batteries, hotel key (in case it’s a false alarm) and cell phone. I put them all in a small nylon shoe bag with a drawstring top and put the bag on the nightstand next to the bed. I put a small, powerful flashlight next to the bag. There is generally a chair in the room and I lay out a pair of jeans, shirt and shoes on the chair. Next, I check the hotel layout diagram on the back of the door or I walk down the hallway to establish where the emergency stairs and fire escape is located.

MONTREAL - The first person in Montreal to die of COVID-19 was a member of the city's Hasidic Jewish community.
 Max Lieberman, with the Council of Hasidic Jews of Quebec, said today the 67-year-old man started exhibiting flu-like symptoms on Sunday and died Wednesday.
 Lieberman says the family had a private, graveside funeral service instead of the more typical large affair given rules forbidding gatherings amid the COVID-19 outbreak.
 He says the community is on edge because many members had participated in large gatherings for a religious holiday, just prior to the introduction of widespread isolation directives by health authorities.
 But Lieberman says the stress eases with each day that passes without a spike in the community's infection numbers.
 As of Thursday, 48 per cent of Quebec's COVID-19 cases were reported in Montreal and the city's west-end is deemed a hot spot for the virus.
 Dr. Horacio Arruda, Quebec's director of public health, says authorities are monitoring that part of the city and will implement further measures as needed.
 This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 27, 2020.

A project for future display of banners at Wechsler School and use as a traveling exhibit for schools and local observances has been completed.
 The retractable banners, titled “Intersection of Education/Civil Rights in the Struggle for Equal Rights in Meridian features one with education sites and the other with Civil Rights sites. According to Wechsler Foundation President Edward Lynch, the displays will be placed at Wechsler School, the first brick school for African Americans built with public funds, once the renovation of the 1951 building is completed. They also will be used as traveling exhibits, as well as be available for school programs and observances for Black History Month, Memorial Day, Veterans Day and Independence Day.
 "We are all one community and Wechsler has been significant in the lives of so many people in this community,” Lynch said. “I’m just hoping that people will just see the impact of these major African-American icons, which have not only served the African-American community, but have served the community at large over the years.”

Obviously, Lamont has a bit more to worry about with working at the hospital than the potential of her missing golf season. However, that hasn’t stopped her, her teammates and her coach from staying in contact about everything from the virus to sports. Head coach Janet Woodhouse has kept the team in the loop via group text, encouraging players on both the boys’ and girls’ teams to take advantage of their free opportunities to hit the courses at the Vinton Country Club and Wildcat Golf Course. Lamont said that while the weather hasn’t been ideal for golf this week, she’s hopeful to get out to the links in the upcoming days.
 “Even if we don’t end up going back, I want to practice,” she said. “I just enjoy golf, and I love doing it for fun... golf is definitely my favorite sport, so I would love to be able to go back to some extent, even if it’s just a couple of meets or just a chance to qualify for state. I would be so thankful for that.”
 During her time away from the course, Lamont said she has taken up reading more than she usually does. Outside of working more hours at the hospital, she’s reading ‘The Giver,’ a novel given to her by a coworker. Lamont said she enjoys reading a little bit more now than before without the obligation to do so.
 Still, Lamont knows there’s a real chance she doesn’t get to compete in certain scenarios. If the worst should happen, she wants younger athletes across all sports to not take the time they have with their respective teams and coaches for granted.
 “They should really cherish their next year and however many seasons they get to enjoy,” she said. “Looking back, high school is just a really cool time that you need to do that. A lot of people don’t get those opportunities.”
 However the season – or the lack of one – turns out, Lamont is prepared to look back on a successful golf career without any regrets.
 “I just have to look at it from a positive light,” she said. “I’ve had so many great experiences over the past three years of golf, and I know that golf is a sport that can be lifelong. It doesn’t end here for me. I can always go out and play with my family for the rest of my life.”
