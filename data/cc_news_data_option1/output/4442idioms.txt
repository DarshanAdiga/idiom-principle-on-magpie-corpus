_Bangkok, 02 nov 06:57 - (Agenzia Nova)_ \- Il decreto in vigore dalle 4 antimeridiane del 15 ottobre proibisce gli assembramenti di cinque o più persone, e la pubblicazione online di messaggi che “possano dare adito a timori o che distorcono intenzionalmente l’informazione, causando fraintendimenti a detrimento della sicurezza nazionale, della pace e dell’ordine”. Poco dopo la proclamazione dello stato di emergenza, centinaia di agenti di polizia sono stati dispiegati nel centro della capitale per disperdere i manifestanti. Sei partiti di opposizione della Thailandia, guidati da Pheu Thai – la formazione fondata dall’ex premier in esilio Thaksin Shinawatra – hanno preso apertamente posizione contro la proclamazione dello stato di emergenza a Bangkok. In un comunicato congiunto, i partiti affermano che il provvedimento del governo “non ha ragioni legittime”, e che lo stato di emergenza è stato utilizzato dall’esecutivo “come strumento politico per limitare la libera espressione delle idee”. Nel comunicato, le forze di opposizione rivolgono una serie di richieste al primo ministro Prayuth e ai funzionari del governo, a cominciare dalla revoca dello stato di emergenza e l’impegno a non ricorrere all’uso della forza, inclusa quella militare.

 SELINSGROVE — Shamokin defensive back Ryder Zulkowski made the perfect play in the second quarter of the Indians’ 15-0 victory over Selinsgrove in the District 4 Class 4A semifinal on Friday night.
 Well almost perfect.
 Zulkowski stepped in front of a Selinsgrove receiver after reading the pass play perfectly, with a wide-open field in front of the sophomore — except he dropped the ball.
 “Ryder he dropped that first one, and he’s so hard on himself,” Shamokin coach Henry Hynoski said. “I told him, ‘you’ll get yours soon enough.’”
 With the Seals trying to put together a late drive, nobody followed a Seals receiver on the left side of the formation. Zulkowski raced out to get him covered, but the ball was snapped, forcing Zulkowski to chase the Selinsgrove player down the field. Zulkowski did such a good job of chasing down the receiver, he made the interception, the first of two he made in the game.

 Title game facts
 Friday night’s District 4 title game appearance for the Indians will be the school’s first since they won the 2011 District 4 Class 3A championship, beating Milton, 21-20. Shamokin that season won a district title, and the first state playoff game in school history, beating Clearfield in the next round. Despite its playoff success that season, Shamokin still finished the season at 6-8.
 This will also be the first time in three seasons that District 4’s biggest classification won’t be decided by a Jersey Shore and Selinsgrove district championship game.

 I miss the road.
 I realize that it has only been eight months since the world, as we knew it, stopped turning, but I was supposed to have been to a lot of places in those eight months.
 I can't tell you all of the places because one of them was a mystery to everyone traveling with me, and I am holding out hope that we will still make the trip. But the itinerary encompassed some of the most beautiful areas this great land has to offer. That was just April.
 In May I was supposed to visit the magnificent Greenbrier Resort in West Virginia and enjoy all its amenities -- such as the world-class golf course and the bunker where Congress was supposed to hide when the Soviet Union dropped the Big One. We were going to throw in Thomas Jefferson's home and the Naval Academy, Delaware and the Outer Banks, too, just for good measure.
 And there were summer trips to Scotland and Ireland and another to Germany and Switzerland for the Passion Play that is only held every 10 years. And we were supposed to go to Alaska and New England and Key West and so many other wonderful places that I cannot keep track of them all.
 Like I said, I miss the road. I have been immeasurably blessed to be able to travel over the past seven years to every state in this amazing union several times and to 54 foreign nations. I've seen sights and treasures that I never dreamed I would see outside of a book when I was growing up in Porterdale.
 And I have traveled with some of the most fun-loving and cooperative people on the planet -- and, let's face it -- one or two old grumps. And I have a million memories that will warm my heart for as long as I live.
 I found that I couldn't sleep Wednesday night -- I suppose it was technically Thursday morning -- so I got up and sat in the dark on my back porch, watching the rain fall and listening to the tropical winds howl -- yes, we got tropical winds in Bishop on Thursday morning -- and reflected on the places I had been and the people I had met and the precious memories I had made.
 I told myself that I should just be happy to have had the opportunities, and I am. But I still miss the road.
 And this week I miss the Georgia coast. Georgia-Florida week has been one of the highlights of my year for a long time. But not this year. Not in 2020.
 My trip to Jacksonville has evolved over the years from quick dashes south of the Florida state line with my buddies -- there were years we went down and back on the same day -- to short weekends with just my lovely wife, Lisa, and I, to weeklong vacations where Lisa and I would go down early and serve as the advance team while our children arrived, one by one or two by two, as the week progressed.
 And after experimenting with locales as diverse as Amelia Island, St. Augustine and the Jacksonville Landing, we finally settled in on the Golden Isles, choosing to spend our money in the great state of Georgia. Sometimes we would stay on St. Simons, amidst the madness that is -- or was -- Frat Beach. Sometimes we stayed on the more serene Jekyll Island. When we stayed on Jekyll, we made several trips around to St. Simons because nobody should ever go to the Georgia coast without enjoying some barbecue at Southern Soul or some fresh fried Georgia shrimp at the Crab Trap.
 And there were always plenty of stories to share and new avenues to explore. And, of course, game day and epic tailgates and memorable games. I started attending Georgia-Florida in the '60s when Vince Dooley owned the Gators. We would show up in Jacksonville expecting to win and were rarely disappointed. Then things changed and Saturdays along the banks of the St. Johns River were not quite as enjoyable.
 Finally, however, the pendulum began to swing back the other way and we have grown accustomed to going home happy, just like the Dooley days.
 But this year I will watch Georgia-Florida from the confines of my basement bunker, a week later than normal. I miss the road.
 I am going to be a rebel, however. I will watch alone from my basement, but I am not going to wear a mask. So, chomp that!

Martinsville Speedway will recognize the historic accomplishments of seven-time NASCAR Cup Series champion Jimmie Johnson by starting an annual scholarship, Jimmie Johnson Champion’s Award. The scholarship will be awarded annually to a student at one of the Martinsville- Henry County Public High Schools. “Jimmie Johnson is among the greatest champions in the history of motorsports,” said Martinsville President Clay Campbell. “He is a beacon for all that is good about the sport on and off the track as he has represented NASCAR with class throughout his championship career. As we share his legacy with future students in Martinsville-Henry County, we will recognize his accomplishments at Martinsville Speedway and across the sport with students who will make a different in our community and the region in the future.” “Martinsville is a special track to me – it’s one of my favorite places to race and I have so many great memories there,” said Johnson. “This gift is so meaningful. The Jimmie Johnson Foundation’s focus is on public education and assisting a child with a scholarship can make such a difference. I’m thankful to Martinsville Speedway, President Clay Campbell and everyone who made this possible.” The Jimmie Johnson Champion’s Award will recognize a student who shows promise in a STEM-based education program at one of the Martinsville-Henry County Public High Schools. A student must be nominated by a teacher or school official for consideration. The recipient of the award will be presented with a plaque and a $1,000 scholarship to continue their education. The design of the Jimmie Johnson Champion’s Award plaque will be shared publicly in the near future. At Martinsville, Johnson is tied for third with Jeff Gordon for the most NASCAR Cup Series wins at the track with nine. Richard Petty leads with 15 followed by Darrell Waltrip with 11 at Martinsville. Johnson was victorious in the 2004, 2006, 2007 Subway 500, 2007 Goody’s Cool Orange 500, 2008 Tums QuikPak 500, 2009 Goody’s Fast Pain Relief 500, 2012 Tums Fast Relief 500, 2013 STP Gas Booster 500, and 2016 Goody’s Fast Relief 500. He is one of an exclusive list of nine drivers in track history to sweep a Cup Series season at Martinsville with Fred Lorenzen (1964), Richard Petty (1967, 1969, 1972), Cale Yarborough (1977), Darrell Waltrip (1989), Geoffrey Bodine (1990), Rusty Wallace (1994), Jeff Gordon, 2003, 2005), Johnson (2007), and Denny Hamlin (2010). He is also one of only 12 drivers to win back-to-back Cup Series races on different years at Martinsville. Among active drivers, Johnson holds the most Cup Series victories at Martinsville followed by Denny Hamlin with five wins. He also leads active drivers with 19 top-5’s and 25 top-10’s. Johnson is competing in his final Cup Series race at Martinsville as a full-time competitor in the Xfinity 500 Playoff race today. The race is televised nationally on NBC and air on MRN and its network of nationwide affiliates, in addition to SiriusXM NASCAR Radio.

SEATTLE (AP) — Joelle Wheatley hit her pandemic-parenting rock bottom after her son was sent home from day care for a second time, with the sniffles, due to stricter health guidelines in a symptom-sensitive COVID-19 world. It was supposed to be Jacob's first day back after a stressful 10-day home quarantine for another mild symptom that turned out to be harmless. Frustrated, desperate — there were no other care options, and she needed to focus on work — and certain that the 2-year-old’s runny nose and cough were also benign, the Seattle mom defied the day care’s orders and brought him back the next day anyway. “I was just so sure he had a cold, and that sounds so irresponsible,\" said Wheatley, 43, who works at an early education nonprofit. \"But I honestly was just in such a low place.” As more families make the jump back to group day care this fall in an attempt to restart lives and careers, many parents, pediatricians and care operators are finding that new, pandemic- driven rules offer a much-needed layer of safety but also seem incompatible with the germy reality of childhood. They stem largely from coronavirus guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lowering the fever threshold, disqualifying even a single bout of diarrhea or vomiting and making sniffles suspect in group settings. But the guidelines don’t take into account that young children are prone to catching the common viral infections that help build up their immune systems, or that seasonal allergies, crying, even teething and normal playground exertion can prompt a COVID-19-like symptom. And the price parents and kids pay for such symptoms — which could easily signal either a happy, healthy toddler, or a lurking case of the disease that has now killed more...

In the original game, much of the combat was controlled by waggle via the Wii Remote and Nunchuck. While you can use the Joy-Cons like Wii controllers in the new release, there is now a range of control options, from the Joy-Con-as- Wii-Remote method all the way to a no-motion-control, all-button method in handheld mode. I played the new release of No More Heroes, from start to finish, in handheld mode without being asked to use motion controls once. I loved it, and I never want to go back to the waggle method. Attacks are mapped to the face buttons with high and low options, and forced waggle (like charging your beam katana, Death Blows, and wrestling moves) are mapped to the right and sometimes left sticks. The game is far easier to control this way, and while I was a skeptic, I am now a believer.

The current population reflects a drop of more than 50% since the prisons hit their highest inmate count — 72,773 in 1999.
 Those released early from their sentences include 2,254 individuals who were within 90 days of their scheduled release and had been sentenced for non- violent crimes that were not classified as sexual assaults.
 State officials have been mapping plans to close at least two prisons this year. But so far the locations of the facilities being considered for closure haven't been shared with the public.
 The inmates let out of prison early include 12 women who were pregnant or had recently given birth and had convictions for non-violent crimes that were not of a sexual nature. Those women were within 180 days of their approved release dates when they were sent home, according to Mailey.

The funny thing is that Harmony of Dissonance was Igarashi’s attempt to recreate Symphony of the Night on the Game Boy Advance. This is understandable; Harmony was his first Castlevania game after Symphony, and he did not appreciate the dark colors of Circle of the Moon (none of us did). Thus, his first order of business was to make everything neon. The protagonist, Juste Belmont, wears a bright red coat and has a bright blue shadow following his every move. Every background and enemy is a garish tone; it’s an ugly game. Harmony does manage a gaming impression of Symphony, even including a poorly-implemented second castle (though not inverted). There are a lot of things holding Harmony back, including an unusually obtuse map, disappointing soundtrack, and some bizarre equipment decisions, like having to equip certain items to unlock doors (a carryover from Symphony). Thankfully, Igarashi must have learned from this experience, because his very next Castlevania game is much higher on my list.

Biden's Response to Laptop Bombshell Shows How Out of the Loop He Really Is

MORGANTOWN — West Virginia had an answer for all of Kansas State’s tricks on Saturday and it gave a crowd of 10,441 quite a treat.
 Nearly everything No. 16 Kansas State (4-2 overall, 4-1 Big 12 Conference) did well in running its conference record out to 4-0 prior to Saturday’s 37-10 win for the Mountaineers was neutralized all while WVU corrected some of its own mistakes along the way. Where West Virginia didn’t necessarily have answers for opponents or was its own undoing in losses at Oklahoma State and at Texas Tech, the Mountaineers seemed to possess K-State’s kryptonite while not ingesting their own.
 It wasn’t perfect — a football game never is — but it had the feeling of a monumental step forward in a big-time game against an opponent that was on top of the league standings.
 “Proud of everyone in our organization, now we’ve got to continue to keep it moving,” WVU coach Neal Brown said.
 If one were to erase the team names from the post-game stat sheet, one would likely guess wrong as to who was who.
 Kansas State entered Saturday with 10 takeaways and just two turnovers, leading the league in turnover ration and placing in a tie for second in the country. On Saturday, it was WVU (4-2, 3-2) that created three turnovers (interceptions by Sean Mahone, Nicktroy Fortune and Dylan Tonkery) while not turning the ball over itself.
 The Wildcats had also returned two interceptions. The Mountaineers entered having had two critical fumbles returned for touchdowns against it, one in each the loss to Tech and the loss to Oklahoma State. But on Saturday, the only defensive score of the game went to the Mountaineers after Tonkery picked off a screen pass and ran 16 yards to the end zone in the third quarter to put WVU up by 24 points.
 “Between Sean Mahone, Dylan and even Nicktroy, you see anybody gets a turnover, you get excited,” WVU linebacker Tony Fields said. “Our defense, we’re really learning to feed off each other. Once our brother makes a play, it’s like we made a play.
 “That turned up our defense even more and allowed us to play with the energy we played with today.”
 Another statistic Kansas State has excelled in this season is red-zone offense, where the Wildcats entered a perfect 20 for 20 with 15 touchdowns. The simple answer to that on Saturday was not to let K-State in the red zone to begin with. The Wildcats made it inside the WVU 20-yard line just once and it led to a field goal to put Kansas State up 3-0 in the first quarter.
 Defensively, Kansas State was second in the Big 12 in red-zone defense, allowing scores 72.22 percent of the time, but WVU was a perfect 5 for 5 with three touchdowns and two field goals. And, speaking of field goals, after an early Evan Staley miss he hit a 19-yarder followed by Casey Legg booting home both of his attempts. Those were the first three field goals made against Kansas State this season (opponents had gone 0 for 5 prior to Saturday).

Nine months to the day since Wales launched the 2020 Six Nations tournament with a resounding 42-0 win over whipping boys Italy in Cardiff, England confirmed their status as Europe’s leading international side.
 Then again, we knew that all along.
 The fact that Eddie Jones’ men were able to fluff their lines — they only led 5-10 at half time against a stubborn Italian resistance in Rome — meant they didn’t have to be anywhere near their best to clinch the title on what was once again labeled Super Saturday.
 In truth, the rugby on display over the weekend was anything but super. Scotland accounted for Wales at a windswept Parc y Scarlets in a dour encounter to record three wins in the championship for the first time since 1996.
 England eventually secured the bonus point that everyone knew in advance was coming to propel them to the top of the table but not with the margin one might have expected.
 The shenanigans surrounding the cancelled Barbarians game the previous weekend denied Jones the warm up game required to hit the ground running, the net result of which was that Ireland knew in advance of kick-off in Paris that a four try bonus point win was no longer required to lift the title.
 A victory by a margin of six points with a solitary try in the scoring mix would now suffice. While that was a far more achievable target than the one Andy Farrell might have expected to face in advance in order to be crowned champions, it was still going to require a monumental performance to achieve the spoils.
 At our peak, the two wins in Paris, in 2014 and 2018, against French sides nowhere near as organised and skilful as this one, were both by a margin of two points.
 When it comes to results and consistency over the course of any tournament, the table rarely lies and that is the case with the final standings after five elongated rounds of action.
 England and France are stronger and better-balanced sides than Ireland at present.
 We have slipped back into the middle ground with Scotland and Wales due as much to the well-flagged improvements made within the international set up in France as they prepare to host the next World Cup as to the fall in standards in Wales since the departure of Warren Gatland.
 Paris in the spring has proved problematic for a variety of Irish teams over the years. Now we know that it’s no more forgiving in the fading embers of autumn.

Good for the Danville Area Education Association and the district’s school board for coming to a tentative contract agreement, avoiding what would have been a badly timed teachers’ strike in the district.
 An 11th-hour meeting between the Danville Area School Board and teachers union on Wednesday brought an end to the district’s first projected work stoppage since 2014.
 That is good news. While we don’t know the details of the agreement — both sides seem on track to approve the tentative deal by mid-November — leaders from both sides acknowledged some give and take.
 “We gave some, they gave some and we were able to come to a middle ground, and come to an agreement for the best of the teachers, students, taxpayers, and everybody involved,” union head Dave Fortunato said. “Both sides worked diligently together,” he said.
 “We had to give a little. But they did too. I think we did a good job,” said Bonnie Edmeads, school board president.
 The last time the sides had to negotiate a contract, the 2014 strike was followed by a deal in October 2015. When the sides agreed to the terms of the current expired contract, it was for seven years, retroactive for three years because of the length of negotiations.
 That brought us to the latest set of negotiations, which were again contentious prior to Wednesday’s give-and-take session.

The Government has several priorities which it wishes SNIB to address. However, helping to save a vast number of moribund but potentially vibrant Scottish businesses should come top of the priority pecking order.

The difference was as stark as any moment during the tempestuous 2020 presidential campaign. While Donald Trump barnstormed five states 48 hours before the election, Covid-conscious Joe Biden homed in on one valuable patch of political turf: battleground Pennsylvania.
 Instead of also jetting to Michigan or Wisconsin, swing states he most likely must flip to defeat Trump, Biden spent Sunday campaigning in his birth state, pleading for some voter love in the City of Brotherly Love to help pull him over the finish line.
 "Philadelphia, two more days!" the 77-year-old former vice president boomed to a few hundred people weathering the chill and drizzle as they sat in -- or on -- their cars at a drive-in rally.
 "We need every single one of you to get out and vote on Tuesday," he implored. "In two days we can put an end to a presidency that has fanned the flames of hate all across this nation."
 Biden narrowly leads Trump in Pennsylvania, according to the RealClearPolitics polls average showing him 4.3 percentage points up.
 But his style Sunday was less of a momentum-seizing challenger about to topple the most controversial US leader in a century, and more of a cautious contender going up against a loud-mouthed Goliath.
 At a surprise stop in Philadelphia, a few dozen people gathered in a parking lot to hear a masked Biden speak -- sometimes in tones so hushed people could barely make out what he was saying.
 The neighborhood scene, at dusk during a break in daylong rain, was picturesque, but felt more like a campaign stop by a young wannabe stumping in Iowa six months before the first nomination contest.
 Journalists were kept out of one Biden stop altogether when he addressed a union in nearby Chester, making those in the small pool of reporters following him wonder why he would not want every second of possible exposure.
 \- Safety over 'bravado' -
 The race is boiling down to this eastern state of nearly 13 million residents that Trump won by just 44,000 votes four years ago.
 A full-on Sunday focus on Philadelphia apparently is not enough.
 Biden is scheduled to hold at least three more major events Monday in Pennsylvania, including an Election Night eve drive-in event in Pittsburgh, featuring pop star Lady Gaga.
 The Republican incumbent spent all day Saturday campaigning in Pennsylvania, holding far more audacious and rowdy rallies than Biden.
 They featured thousands of supporters with "Make America Great Again" caps. Social distancing and face masks? Not so much.
 "Nobody's ever seen anything like this," Trump said to cheers.
 Biden's events are a world apart, the poster children of health-conscious campaigning during the Covid-19 era.
 An aide wipes down the microphone and lecturn just before Biden speaks. Unlike Trump, the 77-year-old Democrat wears a mask whenever he is not on stage.
 Voters at Biden's events didn't appear to mind the differences.
 "I care more about the votes than the optics, and I think the votes are on our side," Birgit Hottenrott, a 52-year-old mother, told AFP at Biden's drive-in rally.
 "The optics may be more visible from him," she said of Trump, but "everybody's safety is what's so much more important than ego and bravado."
 Biden is trying to squeeze every last vote particularly out of Philadelphia's black community, a constituency that traditionally supports Democrats but which fell short of expectations in 2016 with Hillary Clinton.
 He brought his campaign to Sharon Baptist Church where some 50 cars were gathered in the parking lot to hear and honk for Biden.
 Bishop Millicent Hunter, a black pastor in Philadelphia, said that while she was confident of Biden taking Pennsylvania, she was on a mission "to encourage people that this is not a time to become complacent."
 When pressed on whether she worried about a 2016 repeat, in which Clinton led in polls in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin only to lose those states and the election, she hesitated.
 "I think we've seen that movie, it was a tragedy," the 60-something pastor said. "I just still think this is going to work for Joe Biden."
 \- 'He's a disgrace' -
 Biden laid into Trump for having the "gall" to suggest doctors and hospitals were "falsely inflating" Covid-19 death numbers in order to boost profits.
 "It's more than offensive, it's a disgrace. He's a disgrace," he said, as supporters honked in agreement.
 Trump presents himself as "a tough guy, a macho man," Biden sneered. "Gimme a break."
 Each candidate has brought contrasting styles to Pennsylvania, and Joseph Gidjunis, a photographer and Biden volunteer from Philadelphia, made clear he understood the stakes in his state.
 "Everyone is doing their closing messages here because the Keystone State could be the key to their victory," the 38-year-old said.

"The moment we get into saying, 'Oh, this is about revenue,' I think we are making a big mistake," Cahill said. "Instead, we need to keep the focus on making sure we don't criminalize any more generations of young people and making sure that legal marijuana is affordable and available to people who are responsibly able to access it. Then, I think we will be OK."
 Cuomo's marijuana policy advisor, Axel Bernabe, said during an Oct. 19 interview with a representative of Canopy Growth, a Canadian marijuana company whose stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, that the Cuomo administration is hoping the legislation is approved in Albany by April 1.
 Bernabe stressed the legislation will address public health concerns and "how do you keep it out of the hands of kids, how do you keep people from driving under the influence, all the stuff that we've heard about." The Cuomo aide also said the marijuana measure will address "social equity" concerns.
 "I would say equity pervades the entirety of the bill," he said. "It pervades it on the licensing front, it’s on the revenue side and the use of funds and providing capital and loans."
 Two states that border New York, Massachusetts and Vermont, and a nearby state, Maine, are among the 11 states (plus the District of Columbia) that have already legalized weed. Voters in another border state, New Jersey, and in three other states, Montana, South Dakota and Arizona will decide on ballot questions Tuesday whether their states should allow the sale of marijuana for adult use.
 Cahill said legalization will yield benefits beyond eliminating the threat of criminal sanctions for those who use cannabis.
 "By taking it out of the milieu of illegal drugs means we will be diminishing, not increasing, access to other drugs" that are outlawed, Cahill said. "It will make marijuana less of a gateway drug. We are not out to convince people to use marijuana. That is not the purpose. If we focus too much on revenue, then we're going to lose sight of the very reasons why we sought this out in the first place."

I miss the road.
   
 I realize that it has only been eight months since the world, as we knew it, stopped turning, but I was supposed to have been to a lot of places in those eight months.
   
 I can't tell you all of the places because one of them was a mystery to everyone traveling with me, and I am holding out hope that we will still make the trip. But the itinerary encompassed some of the most beautiful areas this great land has to offer. That was just April.
   
 In May I was supposed to visit the magnificent Greenbrier Resort in West Virginia and enjoy all its amenities -- such as the world-class golf course and the bunker where Congress was supposed to hide when the Soviet Union dropped the Big One. We were going to throw in Thomas Jefferson's home and the Naval Academy, Delaware and the Outer Banks, too, just for good measure.
   
 And there were summer trips to Scotland and Ireland and another to Germany and Switzerland for the Passion Play that is only held every 10 years. And we were supposed to go to Alaska and New England and Key West and so many other wonderful places that I cannot keep track of them all.
   
 Like I said, I miss the road. I have been immeasurably blessed to be able to travel over the past seven years to every state in this amazing union several times and to 54 foreign nations. I've seen sights and treasures that I never dreamed I would see outside of a book when I was growing up in Porterdale.
   
 And I have traveled with some of the most fun-loving and cooperative people on the planet -- and, let's face it -- one or two old grumps. And I have a million memories that will warm my heart for as long as I live.
   
 I found that I couldn't sleep Wednesday night -- I suppose it was technically Thursday morning -- so I got up and sat in the dark on my back porch, watching the rain fall and listening to the tropical winds howl -- yes, we got tropical winds in Bishop on Thursday morning -- and reflected on the places I had been and the people I had met and the precious memories I had made.
   
 I told myself that I should just be happy to have had the opportunities, and I am. But I still miss the road.
   
 And this week I miss the Georgia coast. Georgia-Florida week has been one of the highlights of my year for a long time. But not this year. Not in 2020.
   
 My trip to Jacksonville has evolved over the years from quick dashes south of the Florida state line with my buddies -- there were years we went down and back on the same day -- to short weekends with just my lovely wife, Lisa, and I, to weeklong vacations where Lisa and I would go down early and serve as the advance team while our children arrived, one by one or two by two, as the week progressed.
   
 And after experimenting with locales as diverse as Amelia Island, St. Augustine and the Jacksonville Landing, we finally settled in on the Golden Isles, choosing to spend our money in the great state of Georgia. Sometimes we would stay on St. Simons, amidst the madness that is -- or was -- Frat Beach. Sometimes we stayed on the more serene Jekyll Island. When we stayed on Jekyll, we made several trips around to St. Simons because nobody should ever go to the Georgia coast without enjoying some barbecue at Southern Soul or some fresh fried Georgia shrimp at the Crab Trap.
   
 And there were always plenty of stories to share and new avenues to explore. And, of course, game day and epic tailgates and memorable games. I started attending Georgia-Florida in the '60s when Vince Dooley owned the Gators. We would show up in Jacksonville expecting to win and were rarely disappointed. Then things changed and Saturdays along the banks of the St. Johns River were not quite as enjoyable.
   
 Finally, however, the pendulum began to swing back the other way and we have grown accustomed to going home happy, just like the Dooley days.
   
 But this year I will watch Georgia-Florida from the confines of my basement bunker, a week later than normal. I miss the road.
   
 I am going to be a rebel, however. I will watch alone from my basement, but I am not going to wear a mask. So, chomp that!

Of all the Igavania titles, I feel this is the pinnacle. It incorporates everything that made Symphony so refreshing, but trimmed all the fat. Aria puts you in the shoes of Soma Cruz, a young man who finds himself transported to Dracula’s castle during an eclipse, who must find his way through the castle and defeat a new iteration of the Count. The game utilizes an interesting magic system in which Soma can absorb the “souls” of the castle’s monsters, each of which confers a different attack/buff/movement upgrade, three of which can be equipped at once. You do spend a good amount of time in the equipment/spell subscreens, but I never felt like it was a pain. Clearly a lot of you did, though, and Igarashi included the ability to hotswap between different builds in every subsequent game. Aria features gorgeous sprite art and a castle that’s large but not too large. The music is also some of the best in the series, although Dawn is no slouch in that regard. Some form of this Aria’s magic system would continue on through the rest of Igarashi’s Castlevania games. If you only play one Igavania game on this list, make it Aria of Sorrow.
