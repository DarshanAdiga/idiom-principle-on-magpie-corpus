“We want to brush away these concerns,” Takaya said, speaking to worried ticket holders.
 However, he offered nothing concrete accept to say that “countermeasures” against COVID-19 will not be determined until this fall. That would include plans for fans, quarantines and so forth.
 Tickets are going to be a battle ground. The organizing committee has budgeted income of at least $800 million from ticket sales, and may be reluctant to return it. The tickets carry a “force majeure” clause, which may permit organizers to avoid refunds.
 “We understand that countermeasures for COVID-19 next year, particularly during games time, is one of the biggest things to address in preparing for the games next year," Takaya said. "But once again these countermeasures will be discussed in more depth from this autumn onward.”
 Like many countries, Japan is headed into a recession brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, Olympic costs have soared. The cost of the delay in Japan has been estimated at $2 billion to $6 billion. Neither the IOC nor organizers have given a figure for the costs to Japan, or who will pay for them.
 Before the postponement, organizers said they were spending $12.6 billion to put on the games. But a government audit last year said the figure was twice that, and all but $5.6 billion is public money.
 When Tokyo was awarded the games in 2013, it said the cost would be $7.3 billion.
 There is also talk of combining the opening and closing ceremony for both the Olympics and Paralympics.
 “Many discussions are ongoing covering various areas, including the ceremonies,” Craig Spence, a spokesman for the Paralympic Games, said in an email. “A lots of things are still at a discussion stage and therefore it’s not appropriate to provide comment on things until they are finalized."
 Olympic Minister Seiko Hashimoto acknowledged costs must be cut, but said safety for athletes could drive them up.
 “Unless safety and security are ensured, there will be uncertainty for the athletes-first point of view,” she said Thursday. “We must study measures including virus testing in order to ensure safety and security.”

 He said: “I know mum would have convinced the doctors and nurses she understood whether she did or not. Mum was very independent. This would have been very much in her nature.
 “I was adamant with the doctors and nurses and asked them directly, ‘why are you letting her home?’. Their response was, ‘she wants to go home and she’s fine to do so’.”
 He told how a friend, a retired nurse, helped administer the insulin based on the levels Mrs Tipper took, but he was still not happy with the arrangement.
 He added he rang her doctor surgery to see if it was possible for a district nurse to administer it to her in future, but says he was told that was not possible.

He was arrested and charged with firearms offences in April 2019 and amazingly given bail despite his long record and refusal to show up for his sentence just months earlier.
 He was arrested again in June 2019 -- allegedly with an illegal handgun -- and finally kept in jail waiting until a judge let him out due to COVID-19.
 I wish this was just a bad trend of judges giving out bail during the pandemic, but it's not.
 Last summer, Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders pushed back against claims by lawyers and activist groups that bail isn't a problem. They actually tried to claim people on gun charges were not getting bail.
 "There are approximately 326 people that are charged with firearms offences that are out on bail right now," Saunders said in August. He noted two men involved in a daylight shooting earlier that week were, you guessed it, out on bail.
 "We do our job and then we come in for the next shift and buddy is back out again," Saunders said, expressing frustration that those arrested don't stay behind bars.
 Saunders has called for bail reform, as has Mayor John Tory and Ontario Premier Doug Ford. Ford has even spent some of the federal guns and gangs money his government received on special prosecutors to oppose bail conditions of those charged with gun crimes.
 Instead of dealing with actual gun crime, though, the Trudeau Liberals are putting all of their efforts into telling licensed gun owners to turn in their hunting and target rifles.
 He's also promising to spend $600 million on this but just $327 million over five years on guns and gangs.
 The real solutions are in front of all of us but the Trudeau government doesn't want to act.
 Dealing with hardened criminals and gun smugglers is hard work. Reforming bail and sentencing conditions may anger parts of the Liberal base even if not doing so results in gangsters shooting up Liberal cities like Toronto.
 It's also easier to fundraise and get votes by scaring people about mean- looking rifles with no history of crime in Canada.
 Our country needs a solution to the problem of gang-and-gun crime. Unfortunately, we won't get it from this government.

Meanwhile, the administrators have written to creditors with an update.
 When Debenhams collapsed into administration, the business owed £155m to creditors, including many suppliers.
 It is still unclear how much will be paid and to whom.
 Debenhams has also been cutting jobs at its head office and closing the majority of its store cafes in a bid to cut costs and become a leaner business.
 A total of 4,000 jobs will be lost as a result of these changes, as well as the 17 store closures.
 The key question now is whether the chain can be rescued from administration as a going concern.
 It is in what is being described as a "light touch" administration, where the current management has remained in place.
 Its lenders are said to remain supportive. They took control of the chain after it collapsed into administration last year, after struggling for years to keep up with the competition.
 The business may not exit administration until the new year.
 Administrators and lenders will no doubt want to see how the business performs post-lockdown, as well as the crucial Christmas trading period, in order to be confident it has a viable future in its current form.
 Future store closures are still possible.
 Debenhams will be back in business on the High Street along with its rivals this month, but it still has a long and difficult journey ahead.

As such, the fiscal crisis we had expected has been amplified and the inescapable conclusion given both the current domestic political configuration and persistent and large public sector deficit going forward, is that the currency will have to depreciate significantly from current levels _over time_. The only uncertainty is the path and timeline that will unfold.
 Should commercial banks as well as the central bank initially choose to fill the deficit, the currency will likely adjust over a longer time period and more than likely in tandem with a renewed widening in the current account deficit. If the domestic monetary sector fails to fund the shortfall, then without any foreign capital, the financial markets may move much quicker to reprice domestic financial assets, including government bonds and the currency.
 Domestic policies or actions could also force (prescribed assets) the private sector (forcing private sector savings rates higher) to accommodate the public sector funding shortfall, in which case the economy will remain mired in stagnation and unemployment will continue to increase - eventually resulting in a likely populist political "black swan" event, leading to a re-pricing of domestic financial assets in any event.
