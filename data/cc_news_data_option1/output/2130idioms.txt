La scelta della data per la presentazione de “Solo insieme si può progettare il futuro” non è casuale.

Una ricorrenza in cui si celebra il passaggio dell'Italia dalla monarchia alla repubblica, un passaggio segnato dal suffragio universale e quindi dal diritto riconosciuto a tutti, donne comprese, di poter esprimere liberamente il proprio voto e fare la propria scelta.

England has gone furthest, with some schools reopening Monday and groups of six people now able to meet up outdoors, including in gardens, if social distancing guidelines are observed.
 Business Secretary Alok Sharma said the British government, which legislates on all the changes in England, was moving cautiously.
 “This is not a dash,″ Sharma told the BBC. “These are very cautious steps that we are taking.″
 Restrictions on elderly people and those with underlying health conditions — who have been asked to remain indoors and stay away from other people since March — have also been eased as the government seeks to restore some normalcy in daily life and to revive the economy.
 But the decision, announced Saturday, was delivered with so little details that many people who have not left their homes since March have been left to wonder whether it's really so safe now.
 Open air markets and car showrooms were among the businesses allowed to re- open in England on Monday. Some sporting events such as horse racing will be staged behind closed doors.

The U.K.'s official coronavirus death toll stands at 38,489, the second- highest in the world after the United States, and about 2,000 new cases of the virus are still being confirmed each day.
 As a result, some see the moves as overly hasty. A debate has raged for weeks as to whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative government is being guided by science or the desire to restart the economy.
 The Association of Directors of Public Health warned that the government is moving too fast and that it isn’t ready to meet the challenges that will follow with the easing of restrictions.
 Its president, Dr. Jeanelle de Gruchy, told the BBC that programs to vigorously track and trace COVID-19 cases must be up and running at full speed for restrictions to be eased.
 “We’re not feeling just yet that we’re confident enough to meet any potential challenge if the government goes too quickly on easing lockdown measures,” she said.
 Parents themselves were struggling whether to voluntarily send their kids back to school. Emma Corps, 39, dropped off her five-year-old daughter Isla at the gates of Queen’s Hill Primary and Nursery School near Norwich.

The tool is partly intended to counter labor coverage that focuses primarily—or exclusively—on workers who are suffering. “You don’t often see workers depicted with any sense of agency,” says Elk. “I think reporters have an obligation to present some sort of hope for people. You really need to paint a picture of what the options are of workers fighting back.”

 "Finally, at seven-thirty, a full ninety minutes late, he knocked at the door. 'Don't even answer it,' I whispered to my friends. 'I don't want to go anywhere with this idiot.'

ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkish Airlines resumed limited domestic flights, restaurants welcomed sit-in customers and beaches and museums reopened as Turkey’s broadest easing of coronavirus restrictions came into effect Monday.
 A Turkish Airlines flight, with 156 people on board, departed from Ankara airport for Istanbul as Turkey lifted a travel ban between 15 of its worst- affected provinces. The air routes between Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, Antalya and Trabzon are the first start, with others scheduled to follow gradually.
 Traffic jams returned to Istanbul, Turkey’s most populous city, while intercity roads filled with people heading for hometowns or to resorts.
 Meanwhile, restaurants and cafes opened their doors to a limited number of customers after some two months of takeout services only.
 Istanbul’s 15th-century Grand Bazaar, museums, libraries, gyms, swimming pools, child care centers and nurseries were among other venues allowed to resume operations.

Good morning, troops. It's Monday, June 1.
   
 Peorians awoke Monday morning to a real-life, small-scale version of what's been playing on their televisions from cities much larger and farther away.
   
 Violence overtook peaceful protests about the police-involved death last week of George Floyd, an African-American man in Minneapolis. With seemingly endless reports late Sunday and early Monday about looting, fires, shootings, stabbings, property damage and other mayhem, Peoria was not immune.
   
 To the Rev. Marvin Hightower, the head of the local chapter of the NAACP, it makes no sense.
   
 "I am hurt and confused," Hightower said during an interview Monday on "The Greg & Dan Show" on WMBD-AM (1470).
   
 "It's taken the focus off the bigger issue, which was getting justice for Mr. Floyd. Now we have devolved into lawlessness."
   
 Hightower said he didn't believe the perpetrators were connected to the protesters who marched Saturday in Downtown Peoria. Hundreds assembled there without incident.
   
 Second District City Councilman Chuck Grayeb echoed Hightower's comments.
   
 "I am certain, absolutely 100 percent, that the folks involved in the peaceful march were good, loyal citizens of Peoria who want the very best, as we all do," Grayeb told Nick in the Morning. "But now a criminal element has entered the picture and is using this as an excuse to do horrific things.
   
 "This has no relationship whatsoever to the advancement of civil rights. This is just pure and simple criminality. Let's just call it what it is."
   
 The councilman had not been able to assess damage in his district, which includes the West Bluff and most of Central Peoria west of Knoxville Avenue.
   
 One of its businesses, the Walmart on University Street, was an initial center of trouble Saturday night. It sustained broken windows late Sunday/early Monday.
   
 Grayeb said he intends to request the City Council sit in emergency session as soon as possible. The police department is expected to offer what it knows about the chaos and what steps it might take to restore order.
   
 The council's next regular meeting is scheduled for June 9.
   
 Council members have been considering cuts in police and fire-department staffing to help pare a $50 million budget deficit that's resulted from the coronavirus pandemic. Grayeb has opposed the cuts.
   
 "I would like to think by now cooler heads will prevail and we will recognize that public safety is what we're cutting now at this point and we will pull back from that precipice," he said.
   
 Hightower hopes for a pullback from a different precipice, it appears.
   
 "Instead of moving toward justice, they have now moved it back toward the opposite direction," he said about the rioters. "We can't let the small percentage overrule the goal, which is to make it better for our community."

Intanto, mentre la Lega 'offre' il suo programma alla coalizione ("Voglio essere solo il volto di una squadra, una proposta e un'offerta alla coalizione di centrodestra, al popolo del centrodestra", dice Altieri, lanciando l'invito a superare "questioni personali e divisioni, guardando al progetto e a quella Puglia che noi sogniamo e che i pugliesi meritano"), il nodo del candidato presidente resta in piedi. "Sono entrambe candidature di un certo spessore, sono assolutamente convinto e certo che i leader dei rispettivi partiti che compongono la coalizione sapranno fare la scelta", ha rimarcato il segretario regionale D'Eramo rispondendo alle domande dei giornalisti a margine della conferenza stampa. "Sono convinto che nei prossimi giorni si arrivera ad una definizione complessiva, e sicuramente importantissimo individuare il candidato presidente, ma io reputo che la rivoluzione del buonsenso, di una nuova visione per questa regione passi attraverso un programma realmente condiviso con l'elettorato. Quindi programma, confronto con chi vive la vita reale ogni giorno (commercianti, artigiani, agricoltori, imprese), noi partiamo da li". Mentre sull'ipotesi di un ticket Fitto-Altieri, circolata in queste ore, il segretario D'Eramo non si sbilancia: "Sono abituato a parlare di cose concrete, oggi presentiamo il programma, poi le costruzioni alchemiche sinceramente non mi appassionano". Intanto, il partito e gia al lavoro per disegnare il quadro delle candidature, alla ricerca di "un perfetto equilibrio tra chi ha costruito questo partito nel corso di questi anni" ma con un arricchimento che  "passa anche attraverso le tante realta positive che si sono avvicinate negli ultimi mesi", dice D'eramo. "Una lista del presidente - aggiunge Altieri - deve avere un occhio soprattutto a tutto quel mondo civico di centrodestra che negli ultimi anni ha fatto altre scelte, perche aveva un'offerta politica non consona e non attrattiva. Noi non crediamo alle marmellate alla Emiliano, chi sosterra la nostra coalizione deve guardare quelle idee chiare che noi abbiamo esposto oggi".
