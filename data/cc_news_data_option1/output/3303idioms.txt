BOSTON (AP) — More than a year after “Full House” star Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, were charged with paying half a million dollars in bribes to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California, the famous couple appears headed for prison. Loughlin and Giannulli will be sentenced on Friday after pleading guilty to participating in the college admissions cheating scheme that has laid bare the lengths to which some wealthy parents will go to get their kids into elite universities. Loughlin’s plea deal with prosecutors calls for her to spend two months behind bars, while Giannulli’s calls for him to serve five months. They will be sentenced in separate hearings held via video conference because of the coronavirus pandemic. The judge said at their plea hearings that he would decide whether to accept their unusual deals with prosecutors after reviewing the presentencing report, a document that contains background on defendants and helps guide sentencing decisions. Unlike most plea agreements, in which the judge remains free to decide the defendant’s sentence, Loughlin and Giannulli’s proposed prison terms are binding if the judge accepts the deals. They are among nearly 30 prominent parents who have admitted to charges in the scheme, which involved hefty bribes to get undeserving kids into college with rigged test scores or fake athletic credentials, authorities said. Ten parents are still fighting the charges. Lawyers for Loughlin and Giannulli had insisted for more than a year that the couple believed their payments were “legitimate donations.” They also accused prosecutors of hiding crucial evidence that could prove the couple’s innocence because it would undermine their case. Loughlin and Giannulli's about-face came shortly after the judge...

You don't have to, but there are certainly safe options if you need to, says Stuart Lustberg, M.D., an ob-gyn in Huntington, New York, who's been delivering babies for more than 30 years. There is a big push by government agencies, hospitals, and physicians to decrease the use of prescription pain meds due to the risk of developing a dependency or addiction. His rule of thumb: If you've had a vaginal delivery, try to stick with OTC pain relief to soothe cramping. "You'll heal the same without prescription meds, and you'll avoid their side effect of severe constipation," says Dr. Lustberg. But if you've had a C-section, the constipation is likely going to be worth the much- needed relief. Even if you're not planning to have a C-section, it's a good idea to talk to your doctor now, just in case, about how they approach pain relief after surgery.

The cultivation season got off to a slow start as the cold springtime weather delayed sowing and the start of the growing season. In June, the hot and dry conditions posed challenges, particularly for pea cultivation. The earliest pea varieties suffered from the hot and dry weather and the size of the total pea harvest will fall short of the targets. In general, the harvest of outdoor-grown vegetables is expected to be moderate. The area under cultivation of oilseed plants was at a record low and the domestic oilseed harvest is expected to be the worst in decades. The total harvest of domestic grains is likely to be substantially weaker than in the previous year. In the Baltic countries, the harvest outlook is good for grains as well as oilseed plants.

“We have red tape marking areas that are off limits to seating,” Baxley said. “If you see red on a fence, that is also an area where you may not stand. There will be several announcements to make sure we fall in compliance with the rules given to us. The red tape on the bleachers marks off that full row.
 “The question of mask requirements have come up multiple times. Masks are a requirement, it is not a recommendation. Please be courteous to staff as they work to enforce the rules that give our seniors an opportunity to play. You will not be let into the facility without a mask. A mask should cover both your nose and mouth simultaneously. Crocheted masks and masks with holes will not be allowed.”
 Baxley also addressed the junior high and varsity games tonight.
 “In order to make (tonight) work, it will alleviate volume if only family members of junior high cheer, dance and football will attend the 6 p.m. game. Following the game there will be an announcement requesting those that do not have family in the varsity game to politely leave to help keep our numbers down. As many of you want to watch your own kids, the people waiting outside would love to watch theirs as well. Please be respectful and give that same courtesy you would want shown to you, to others.
 “Following the junior high game, all players will be escorted off the field and to the field house/safe room to change. There will be no midfield reunion between groups. Coaches talks will also take place off the field. Following varsity, we will shut off the lights and begin ushering people out of the gates. In order for us to continue to have these games, it is important that everyone remember to wear your mask!”
 As far as concessions available tonight, Baxley said it will be just candy and drinks.
 The Bauxite Jr. Miners will kick off at 6 p.m., followed by the varsity at 7 p.m. at The Pit.

OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — Matt Chapman and Matt Olson like to joke they don't usually hit home runs the same days. When they do, the Oakland Athletics are extra powerful. Chapman cleared the fences twice and Olson also connected to help Sean Manaea finally earn his first victory of 2020, and the slugging A's beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 5-1 on Thursday night. With a pair of homers high into the left-field bleachers, Chapman left manager Bob Melvin in awe. “I kind of surprised myself there a little bit. I don't know if I've hit a ball like that since the minor leagues,” Chapman said. “It felt good to drive a few balls today that felt like I wasn't trying too hard to do that. It just kind of happened.” Chapman hit a solo drive in the first and a two-run shot in the eighth. Olson added a two-run homer in the fourth for the AL-best A's (18-8), who have their best record over 26 games since the 1990 club began 20-6. Oakland has an eight-game home winning streak. Chapman notched his sixth career multihomer game and second this season, also doing so Aug. 10 at the Angels. He has been working on his timing. “I don't know if it's the ball, I don't know if the players are stronger, I don't know if the bats ... I don't know,\" Melvin said. “But two balls that go way up in the upper deck in left field does not happen.” Manaea (1-2), who lost the AL wild-card game last fall after a 4-0 September coming back from shoulder surgery, allowed one run on five hits in 5 1/3 innings. He won in his sixth start after reaching five innings for the first time all season his last time out against San Francisco. Eduardo Escobar homered in the fifth for Arizona and Manaea gave way to J.B. Wendelken after Ketel Marte's one-out single in the sixth. Arizona lost a second straight...

LYNNWOOD, Wash. (AP) — On a warm summer night, two food trucks pulled onto a tree-lined street in a hilltop neighborhood outside Seattle. The smell of grilled meat filled the air, and neighbors slurped on boba tea drinks. Toddlers, teens, their parents and dogs sat in the grass, chatting behind masks, laughing and mimicking imaginary hugs to stay socially distant while they waited for their food orders. Long seen as an urban treasure, food trucks are now being saved by the suburbs during the coronavirus pandemic. No longer able to depend on bustling city centers, these small businesses on wheels are venturing out to where people are working and spending most of their time — home. As food trucks hunt for customers that used to flock to them, they're finding a captive audience thrilled to skip cooking dinner, sample new kinds of cuisines and mingle with neighbors on what feels like a night out while safely staying close to home. “This is festival season, fun season. All the stuff we typically do as humans, we can’t do anymore,” said Matt Geller, president of the National Food Truck Association. “Walking out to a food truck is a taste of normalcy, and it feels really good.” YS Street Food Group owner Yuli Shen discovered the hilltop Seattle-area neighborhood through Facebook, and she and a friend who runs the Dreamy Drinks boba tea truck went out together recently and served customers for three hours. It's a change and a relief for Shen. Before the pandemic, she raked in money by parking at Amazon’s campus near downtown Seattle, where hordes of office workers would line up for lunchtime Chinese rice bowls. By July, she was frantically searching for somewhere to go. “It’s very hard to find a location to park, and so we have to find a different place and different people. It’s harder to run the...
