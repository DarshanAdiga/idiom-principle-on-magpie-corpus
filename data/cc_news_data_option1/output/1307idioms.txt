Foldable phones like the Motorola Razr and Galaxy Z Flip attempt to be more pocketable by letting a phone the size of the Galaxy S20 Ultra fold into a size that's actually smaller than an iPhone SE. But when I use a Motorola Razr or Galaxy Z Flip in its open position one-handed, I'm still unable to tap buttons or swipe through menus that are at the top of the phone.
 At this point Apple hasn't officially dipped its toe into the foldable phone waters. And even if it did take this approach there was one more thing the iPhone SE was naturally great at: one-handed use. You didn't need any software tricks or fancy foldable screens to reach things.
 ##  iPhone SE 2 needs more than just Reachability mode  
 The iPhone SE has the same body as the iPhone 5 and 5S and those phones were built to be used one-handed. With their 4-inch displays, your thumb could reach pretty much every part of the screen easily, and that's what I want in the iPhone 9.
 When it launched the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in 2014, Apple employed a new feature called Reachability as a workaround for reaching the top of the new larger screens. To use Reachability, you double-tapped the home button, which lowered the top part of what was on the screen to the middle. It made it easy to reach things one-handed. But having to toggle the mode on and off added extra steps to anything you wanted to do on your phone one-handed.
 Initially, using Reachability on an iPhone X was an exercise in frustration.

"I want to reach out to you in these uncertain and unprecedented times to let you know that I and the New England Patriots are behind you," Belichick said after first introducing himself. "We are all in this together. Thank you to our heroic medical professionals, doctors, nurses, medical workers and others, who are selflessly and courageously doing their job to take care of others in need. We have heard your stories and seen some of your great work. You are truly champions and warriors."
 The acclaimed coach admitted that in a time when the world is "facing a difficult opponent," it will take a lot of "teamwork, discipline and commitment to do the right things all the time."
 "That includes staying at home," he said. "I encourage everyone to shelter in place as long as necessary as we fight this virus together. There are plenty of things we cannot do right now, but let's focus on what we can do. We can adapt, we can adjust and we can make better decisions right now for the betterment of the future. As I tell our team, let's keep stringing good days together and we will get through this."
 Belichick's message comes on the heels of the team using their plane to get 1.2 million N95 masks from China to Massachusetts. This was made possible by Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker and Patriots team president Jonathan Kraft, who is also the chairman of the board at the Massachusetts General Hospital.

American Motors was never part of the Detroit Big Three; it didn't exist until 1954, when the diminished assets of two once-mighty independents, Hudson and Nash, were consolidated.
 So powerful and well financed were the Big Three companies that AMC executives from the start were forced to be extra cautious in spending and resource allocation. One false move could mean financial disaster. It was an era when General Motors commanded 50 per cent of the market, leaving Ford and Chrysler to fight over No. 2 status. AMC survived on the table scraps. Indeed, it survived for the next 35 years by being innovative, creative and efficient.
 The Gremlin was a product of all three of these disciplines. Introduced 50 years ago this month, the subcompact was AMC's response to Ford's new Pinto and Chevrolet's new Vega. Both Vega and Pinto had been in the planning stages for several years and were to be introduced in June and September respectively. By introducing Gremlin a few months earlier, AMC hoped to generate early interest and sales. It did.
 But truth be told, planning for Gremlin actually pre-dated Vega and Pinto by several years and was the product of AMC's practice of trying to identify emerging market trends before their competition did.
 Such work had paid dividends in earlier years. AMC hit a grand slam in the late 1950s when it built North America's first compact car, the Rambler. At the time, AMC executives thought the Big Three's focus on big cars left the market for small cars dangerously exposed. When a recession hit the U.S. in 1957 and '58, big car sales were especially hurt, but sales of the new but modestly priced Rambler soared. Ford, Chrysler and GM responded with their own compacts, but AMC had beat them to the punch.
 By the mid-1960s the compact market was robust, but companies like Volkswagen were making huge inroads into North America. AMC brass thought the time was ripe for an American subcompact. AMC stylists Richard Teague and Bob Nixon were asked to investigate.
 Teague, the chief stylist, was accustomed to working with AMC's tiny budgets. When he designed a new compact Rambler in the mid-1960s, Teague used the same doors as were used for the larger, full-size Ambassador. It saved AMC a lot of money.
 He used the same approach for the new subcompact, Gremlin. Initially, the new car was a shortened version of the Rambler. Another idea was to chop the trunk from AMC's pony car, the Javelin.
 Nixon took the challenge even further and proposed a Hornet without a trunk. Hornet was AMC's new compact, to be introduced in 1969. The overall length of the new car, the Gremlin, would be reduced, making it longer than VW's Beetle but shorter than the planned Pinto and Vega. It was a cheap way to introduce a new car, but again, this was the AMC way.
 And so the new Gremlin was really a Hornet, containing all of the same mechanics. But it was offered as a two-door hatchback only, with enough room for two adults up front and two kids in the back. The car was fitted with four variations of AMC's six-cylinder engine. Later, AMC's venerable 304-cubic-inch V8 would be an option. A three-speed manual transmission was standard equipment. An optional automatic transmission was available.
 Because Gremlin was based on the Hornet, it offered more interior space than Beetle, Vega or Pinto. It was also priced right, at $1,879 U.S.
 The Gremlin name was odd. In a cover story in April 1970, Time magazine said a gremlin was usually defined as a small gnome held to be responsible for the malfunction of equipment. But AMC had its own definition. Its Gremlin was "a pal to its friends and an ogre to its enemies."
 Despite that explanation, some people must have remained mystified as to why any car company would adopt such an odd name. Yet AMC's quirky new car deserved a quirky name. And the fact Gremlin was introduced on April Fool's Day may have been part of AMC's bizarre marketing strategy.
 Although introduced late in the model year, Gremlin sales were brisk for 1970. AMC sold 25,300 units.
 The car remained essentially unchanged for the rest of its run through to 1978. AMC sold 671,475 Gremlins over nine model years. Its best year was 1974, when 171,128 Gremlins were sold. In its last year of production, sales fizzled out to 22,104 units.
 Hornet enjoyed almost similar success. From 1970 until its retirement in 1977, AMC sold 860,000 Hornets. Both cars were manufactured and built at AMC's assembly plant at Kenosha, Wisconsin. Later - after AMC dropped the Gremlin name but continued with the same basic vehicle, now called Spirit - part of the production would be shifted to a new plant at Brampton.
 Over its production run, Gremlin received some subtle improvements and upgrades. Remembered, however, was an unusual partnership between AMC and Levi Strauss. The jeans maker allowed its name to be attached to an optional interior trim, which included spun nylon upholstery made to look like denim. Details included Levi Strauss' trademark copper rivets and red logo tabs. The partnership was AMC's attempt to snag part of the youth market.
 It was never AMC's intention that Gremlin be a good car. It was priced as economical transportation, and that price was adequate because AMC's development costs were kept to a bare minimum. With that in mind, Gremlin could be considered a minor success because of its relatively strong sales.
 And not to be forgotten is the fact that Gremlin deserves an historical footnote. Because it was introduced months before either Vega or Pinto, it was North America's first domestic hatchback.

The Baggage Tractor market is expected to grow at an average annual growth rate of XX.X% during the reference period in the Asia-Pacific region, due to the presence of some of the main distributors of Baggage Tractor in the region. In 2016, A2Z recorded a market of Baggage Tractor valued at XX.XX million dollars. The growing need for robust systems offers investors the opportunity to invest in the development of Baggage Tractor. The risk is therefore that the regional market exceeds its historic value at the end of the study period. Japan is home to key players and must therefore maintain its leading position in the APAC market Baggage Tractor, followed by India and China. In North America, this is the next normal. As a result, the increased application of Baggage Tractor is expected to stimulate growth in the Baggage Tractor market in North America.

Using new UI claims by industry from the state of Washington—the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States—we are able to provide a very rough estimate of the number of workers at high risk of losing health insurance they had through their own employer due to coronavirus-related layoffs (or furloughs or hours reductions). We can’t say exactly how many people will lose insurance coverage altogether for several reasons. For example, some workers who lose EPHI due to layoffs or hours reductions that trigger UI claims may be able to obtain coverage through health care exchanges set up by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or through Medicaid. Some of this group may also be able to obtain continuing coverage through COBRA, paying out of pocket the full cost of their EPHI coverage. Some workers may be able to obtain coverage through other family members, or if only experiencing a temporary furlough or hours reduction, their employers might continue to pay for coverage. On the other hand, our calculations might understate the loss of health insurance coverage because they do not account for family members who are no longer covered because of the policyholder’s layoff. And because not all layoffs result in UI claims, we will underestimate the actual magnitude of job losses.

"Střídat se bude ranní a odpolední směna, zaměstnanci, na které vyjde noční, dostanou náhradu mzdy ve výši 70 procent průměrného výdělku. Uvedl to dnes řekl mluvčí automobilky Pavel Barvík.

Nepřítomnost pracovníků na nočních směnách nám dá možnost využít tento čas k dezinfekci a dalším opatřením pro zajištění maximální péče o zdraví našich zaměstnanců," řekl Barvík. Ve slezské továrně kvůli pandemii nového typu koronaviru dočasně skončila výroba po noční směně v sobotu 21. března. Odstávka měla původně trvat do pondělí 6. dubna, tento týden ve středu ale automobilka oznámila, že ji o týden prodlouží. Výroba se tak má znovu rozjet po Velikonocích v úterý 14. dubna. Barvík uvedl, že obnovení provozu bude nezbytné, ačkoliv osobní i pracovní životy lidí bude pandemie ještě nějakou dobu ovlivňovat. Během odstávky dostávají zaměstnanci náhradu mzdy ve výši 70 procent průměrného výdělku. Část pracovníků ale půjde do práce už příští týden v pondělí a úterý.

Hyundai v Nošovicích zaměstnává přibližně 3300 lidí. Dalších asi 8700 zaměstnanců pracuje u jejích subdodavatelů, z nichž většina výrobu rovněž přerušila.

Bill Callahan’s “Drover,” a track with far less deep bass in the mix, gives us a better sense of the Aonic 215’s general sound signature. The drums on this track get a lovely, natural low-mid richness that lends them a little more thump than usual, but nothing that’s over the top. Callahan’s baritone vocals also get a nice richness, and some added treble edge so that things retain clarity and contour. The acoustic strums and higher-register percussive hits are delivered with clarity, but not the overly sculpted high-mid presence we often hear. The mid-range doesn’t feel as scooped out here as a result—this is a sound signature with plenty of low-end, but the mids and highs are also dutifully represented. I wouldn’t go as far as to say this is a perfectly flat response, but it's far more accurate than the overly bass-boosted sound signatures we often hear.

Fair Haven is doing about 80 percent of their work through telemedicine, and are screening those seeking in-person appointments for symptoms of COVID-19. “There is still a need for face-to-face appointments, but we are doing it at one site,” Lagarde said. “We are trying to bring only non-COVID patients there. Everyone is getting screened with a questionnaire and a temperature check. If they have symptoms, they are being sent to triage.”


  The center is trying to get the word out to immigrants that they can still seek care during the health emergency, she said. They have also waived fees related to COVID-19 for eligible patients. “People are fearful of coming forward, but we want them to know they can come in and be seen and cared for,” Lagarde said.


  At the same time, Fair Haven has taken over the management of health care for thousands of residents of the Bella Vista apartment complex in New Haven. Fair Haven is encouraging social distancing so residents won't have to leave their apartments to seek services.


  “We’re doing as much telemedicine or telephonic medicine as possible. We’ve even set up a specific phone line for residents of Bella Vista,” Lagarde said. “Staff will go into their apartments wearing personal protective equipment if they need an in-person visit to make sure patients there are cared for. We’re also trying to coordinate with them for their food.”


  In the short term, the new efforts are working. The crisis has generated innovations in patient care, said Mollie Melbourne, president and CEO of Southwest Community Health Center, which serves 27,000 people in the greater Bridgeport area. But the financial impact of closing dental clinics to all but emergencies and reduced in-person visits will likely take a long-term toll, Melbourne said.


  “We started with telephonic services because it was able to get up and running pretty quickly,” Melbourne said. “Almost all patients have access to a telephone.”


  The center has now fully launched telemedicine and video conferences for those patients who have internet access, she said. Some of the telemedicine care is being done by providers treating patients who are 65 or older or who have health conditions that would put them at higher risk for complications if they contracted the virus, Melbourne said.


  Transportation has always been a barrier for patients, Melbourne said. “This is a huge opportunity for our population to make sure they are getting the services they need,” she said. “Now we can serve just about all of their needs remotely. In some ways, the crisis has helped because it’s forced us to figure out very quickly how to provide services.”


  There have been other adjustments as well. The women’s health care site is now used for urgent care. Three locations switch between wellness visits for child immunizations and prenatal care in the morning to sick visits in the afternoon.


  Everyone who is seen at Southwest Community Health Center is screened for a fever and other symptoms of COVID-19, which include cough and difficulty breathing, before they are allowed to walk in the door, Melbourne said. “We are trying to limit the movement and travel to our sites to be seen. We can do a lot of appointments on the phone,” she added.


  Southwest has had to furlough some employees due to the downturn in patient numbers, Melbourne said. She’s also concerned about the long-term impact the crisis will have on access to health care in the communities they serve.


  “We are losing tens of thousands of dollars each day,” Melbourne said. “As a result of this financial impact, we have paused expansion efforts, with the exception of a project already underway, and implemented a hiring freeze. This will have a lasting impact on our patients and community as our plans were in direct response to need.”

You can also double your box -- saving 10% -- if you want to get a friend or significant other in on the tasting experience. Vinebox uses a special rebottling process to preserve the wine's taste, and each tube can keep the wine good for up to three years.
 Until July of last year, Vinebox was a monthly service. The customer experience has changed only slightly, but the wine curation is focused even more on discovery than before. You still have control over your preferred red to white ratio for your boxes.
 If you really like one or more of your testers, you can buy a whole bottle on the Vinebox website (a perk for subscribers only). If you sign up for a quarterly subscription ($72 and up per quarter), you get a $15 credit towards a full bottle every three months. If you pay for the full year, you'll get a $30 credit each quarter. We also like that it's really easy to skip a month or cancel your subscription right from your online account.

Gilead is using the same remdesivir dosage in the COVID-19 trials as used in the Ebola trial. Fortunately, COVID-19 infected patients do not have circulatory problems. Also, COVID-19 targets the lungs, and remdesivir robustly inhibits COVID-19 replication in human airway epithelial cells in vitro. The selected trial dosage is based on the effective in vitro inhibitory concentration along with in vivo pharmacokinetics and toxicity data. Accordingly, lung epithelial cells of COVID-19 infected patients receive an effective concentration of remdesivir. Remdesivir may also be more readily incorporated into coronavirus RNA than Ebola RNA since remdesivir appears to have a higher affinity for the coronavirus polymerase than the Ebola polymerase.


  A blogger recently opined remdesivir's unpredictable success based on the poor performance of a similar type of drug, favipiravir. However, favipiravir has never been reported to inhibit coronavirus replication (figure 2). Moreover, many nucleoside analogues fail to inhibit virus replication because the virus’s proofreading nuclease detects and removes them. Remdesivir mostly evades proofreading by the coronavirus exoribonuclease, thus allowing incorporation and viral inhibition.


  Nucleoside and nucleotide analogues are tried and true antiviral drugs, making up almost half of all antivirals. Chloroquine is another antiviral that has shown promise in treating COVID-19. Unfortunately, chloroquine can have serious side effects such as vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, and headache. These side effects may be particularly hazardous in ill COVID-19 patients and is out of the question for intubated patients.


  RNA viruses have high mutation rates and mutations in COVID-19 surface glycoproteins could eventually make the current vaccines under development less effective. An annual vaccine version, like the flu vaccine, may be necessary. Moreover, vaccines produce less protection in the elderly. Thus, a vaccine will not make remdesivir obsolete. Remdesivir's efficacy relies on polymerase nucleotides conserved across diverse coronavirus strains. This indicates that remdesivir will be front-line therapy for today's COVID-19 and tomorrow's new coronavirus strain. Gilead's first remdesivir patent filing was in 2014, which gives Gilead exclusivity rights until 2034.

NEW YORK -- The coronavirus pandemic's mounting death toll besieged New York City morgues and hospitals struggled to treat thousands of infected patients on Thursday with a dwindling supply of ventilators and protective equipment.


  Funeral homes and cemetery directors described a surge in demand not seen in decades as cases of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, surpassed 50,000 in the city, with nearly 1,400 dead.


  "In many ways New York state is a microcosm of the United States and that's why I think it is going to be illustrative to the rest of the nation as to what is going to happen," New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said.


  The human costs were further underscored by new evidence of the economic devastation wrought by the pandemic, with more than 90% of Americans ordered to ride out the crisis at home.


  The U.S. government reported that a record 6.6 million Americans filed for jobless benefits last week, double the previous all-time high set a week earlier.


  "It takes your breath away," said Justin Hoogendoorn, head of fixed income strategy and analytics at Piper Sandler in Chicago. "Obviously the immediate reaction to something like that is going to be fear."


  Texas became the 40th state to issue a stay-at-home order on Thursday to help contain the spread of the virus.


  As if 10 million Americans losing their jobs in two weeks were not enough, the U.S. death toll soared by 950 on Wednesday, marking the third day in a row of record increases. Another 800 deaths reported so far on Thursday increased the national toll to more than 5,600 dead, according to a Reuters tally of official data.


  Confirmed U.S. cases surpassed 235,000 on Thursday, double that of Italy, the country with the second most cases. The White House task force on the pandemic estimates 100,000 to 240,000 people could be killed even if lockdown orders are respected.


  Globally, the number of confirmed infections approached one million, with more than 50,000 fatalities as of Thursday, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center.


  To deal with the mounting number of deaths, the U.S. Defense Department was looking to provide up to 100,000 body bags to fill an order placed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, a Pentagon official told Reuters on Wednesday.


  New York City crematories were extending their hours and burning bodies into the night, with corpses piling up so quickly that city officials were surveying cemeteries elsewhere in the state for temporary interment sites.


  "We've been preparing for a worst-case scenario, which is in a lot of ways starting to materialize," said Mike Lanotte, director of the New York State Funeral Directors Association.


  At Brooklyn's Wyckoff Heights Medical Center, staff were seen disposing of their gowns and caps and other protective wear in a sidewalk trash can on Thursday after wheeling bodies out of the hospital and loading them into a refrigerated truck.


  Reuters was unable to confirm whether the bodies were those of coronavirus victims and hospital administrators could not be reached for comment. Operator Beatrice Pereira said, "They said that there's no one available right now, that everyone here is busy saving lives."


  SUPPLIES RUN LOW


  An emergency stockpile of medical equipment maintained by the U.S. government has nearly run out of protective gear for doctors and nurses, as governors and healthcare providers across the country clamor for protective gear and medical equipment such as ventilators, which help COVID-19 patients breathe.


  After New York City appointed former police commissioner James O'Neill to oversee its medical supply chain, U.S. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York called on President Donald Trump to appoint a national czar with military experience to oversee the production and distribution of medical supplies.


  "The system that the administration has in place is horrible," Schumer told MSNBC.


  Trump tweeted that New York has received more federal aid than any other state and said the man he describes as "Cryin' Chuck Schumer" and local officials should stop complaining, saying they should have stocked up long ago.


  Cuomo, who reported another 432 deaths and 8,669 new cases in his state in the past 24 hours, said his state was creating its own central stockpile, asking hospitals to contribute supplies that the state would then redistribute based on need.


  New York City received 400 badly needed ventilators on Wednesday, but Cuomo warned the state's reserve of 2,200 ventilators would run out within six days.


  In one ray of light, Florida officials agreed to allow two Holland America Line cruise ships afflicted with the coronavirus to dock at a port in Fort Lauderdale, resolving a days-long impasse, NBC reported.


  After 27 days at sea in which four passengers aboard one of the ships died, they can dock in Fort Lauderdale.

Maybe wine isn't your drink of choice, but it's always nice to have a few bottles around. Ninety Plus Cellars ships rebranded wines from reputable wineries every three months. Meaning, they purchase a small percentage of bottles from vineyards with histories of highly rated wines and repackage them.
 This way, you get three or six standout bottles each quarter for a fraction of their cost. For $50 per quarter and up, you can get the three best wines of the season, six reds, or a mix of six reds, whites and occasional roses and/or bubbly. It recently added the option to choose a dozen reds or a mix of a dozen bottles, in case you want to stock up for a party or the holiday season. Some of the older, legacy wine club companies still do four shipments a year, but we think Ninety Plus offers a better value and has a more user-friendly website.

DOGWATCH
 THE sad loss of Ipswich club legend Col Byers in June last year has not stopped the kennels manufacturing line of winners.
 Col’s legacy lives on with Pauline (Byers) who has hit a purple patch of form in the past fortnight. Pauline has seven winners since March 17.
 Col had a vice-like grip on the trainer’s premiership, especially late in his career when he won eight of the previous nine years.
 With Byers having one of the biggest kennels in Queensland and the largest to race solely at Ipswich, it was uncertain what would happen to his team after his passing.
 However, with the support of his family and a helping hand from fellow trainers, he’s sure to be enjoying seeing more winners from up above.
 The Byers kennel isn’t alone in the chase for the premiership with another of the perennial contenders Gerard Bowe chiming in with a hat-trick on Tuesday. That boosted his total to four winners in the past fortnight.
 Take All and It’s a Rush gave the trainer a race-to-race double, winning a maiden heat and maiden final on Tuesday, before Cult Hero notched another victory.
 Harrisville trainer Darren Johnstone has emerged as one of the smaller kennels putting their names up in lights, also scoring four wins in the past two weeks - half of them to Stitched Up Flo who has had a remarkable road to recovery.
 The bitch received multiple injuries as a pup when she escaped from the property and Johnstone was told she would never race again but has now won twice over the 431 metres including an impressive 25.12 gallop.
 All kennels have multiple entries in Friday and Saturday’s meets as they continue to battle for the title.
 Auction series on hold
 THE prestigious 520 metre Ipswich Auction Series due to start last Saturday has been postponed from its original April 4 start date to April 18, amid Covid-19 measures currently in place.
 The series carries nearly $80,000 total prize money for participants bought through the Ipswich Puppy Auctions.
 With several greyhounds stuck interstate and unable to travel for a crack at the event, club president Colin Fry said it was fair and appropriate course of action.
 While April 18 is the current date set for the heats to begin, the club is fluid in its ability to further move the event given the latest updates about the outbreak. However, Fry ensured all concerned it would be run. It was just a matter of when.
 All other meets and races will continue as scheduled with the demand for a run at Ipswich as high as ever.
 Swift Dancer’s hot step
 FRESH was best for Postman’s Ridge trainer Gary Mitchell and his two-and-a- half-year-old bitch Swift Dancer in Tuesday’s lone 520 metre contest.
 The equal favourite finished all over the top of Greg Stella’s Inspired Hope in a huge win.
 Stuck at least six lengths off them with a wall of dogs in front of her down the back, Swift Dancer didn’t deviate from her inside line methodically picking her way through the field.
 Swift Dancer picked up Inspired Hope with time to spare, winning by three lengths in 30.78.
 What made the performance more impressive was the fact she did it first up off a 38 day break over the unsuitable sprint distance.
 Swift Dancer has made her name as a 600 metre and further greyhound.
 Ageless runner at it again
 QUEENSLAND’S oldest active race dog Logan City, trained by Peter Evans looked more like a two-year-old not a soon to be six-year-old.
 Logan City pinged the lids, leading all the way in Tuesday’s Fourth Grade over the 431 metres.
 It was start 114 and win 21 for the chaser.
 Despite not being known for his early speed, he loves the inside box and found his way to the top from the two. There was no looking back from there as the usual Thursday night 520 metre contestant posted a 25.24 three length win.
 Price’s Pair class prevails
 CANUNGRA trainer Joanne Price enjoyed a night out last Saturday with sister and brother combo Ash Star and Infrared Lad returning to the winner’s circle after an unusually long absence.
 Ash Star only returned to her original kennel around four months ago after spending the majority of her career racing in open company over the 520 and 600 metres in Victoria.
 She hit the ground running in Albion Park’s Group Three Golden Ticket, finishing third behind Sennachie and Sequana. She looked set to take over but has gone through a relatively lean stretch since.
 Price brought her back to their home track at Ipswich over the short course 431 metres looking for a confidence builder. That’s just what she got, with the bitch getting around the first corner in a clear second and sailing on by for a five-length win.
 Infrared Lad got his chance in a tough fourth and fifth grade field in race eight, his superior strength shining through as his main competitor Tom Tzouvelis’ Queensland Derby placed Cooper Dooper found trouble early.
 Infrared Lad also had to overcome 431 metre Auction Sprint Series runner-up Barcol Boy, but in the end his 600-metre pedigree shone through zipping past Ultra Dior late to win by a length and a half in 30.71.

BRASILIA -- At a tense cabinet meeting on Saturday in the Brazilian president's official residence, Jair Bolsonaro found himself isolated.
 The far-right leader convened the emergency meeting in Brasilia's modernist Alvarado Palace to resolve a dispute with Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta, who publicly opposed the president's calls to loosen quarantine restrictions for Brazil's 210 million people.
 But, with Mandetta unwilling to back down, Bolsonaro's closest aides refused to support his plan to relax coronavirus rules to keep the economy going, according to two sources with knowledge of the meeting.
 Elected two years ago on a promise to revive growth, Bolsonaro has shocked health experts around the world by persistently playing down the gravity of the epidemic, calling COVID-19 "a little cold" exaggerated by the media and his opponents - even after his political idol U.S. President Donald Trump walked back his own skepticism about the outbreak.
 The sources said senior ministers, including high-profile Justice Minister Sergio Moro, sided with Mandetta on the imperative to reinforce social distancing and put the public health crisis before concerns over paralyzing the economy.
 Even top military officers in the government - who until now have neither publicly criticized nor defended Bolsonaro - sprang to Mandetta's defense.
 In a thinly veiled rebuke to Bolsonaro, Presidential Chief of Staff Walter Braga, an active duty Army general, said Mandetta's departure from the cabinet was out of the question.
 "It was a very harsh meeting," one government official briefed on the talks told Reuters. "Mandetta is skating on thin ice, but there are some things he is not open to changing."
 The tensions illustrate the extent to which Bolsonaro's efforts to keep Latin America's largest economy running as normal have split his cabinet, emboldened his opponents and alienated even his staunchest allies in Congress.
 Some politicians have proposed impeachment proceedings against Bolsonaro for endangering public health, but even if they might have the votes to put the president on trial, leaders in Congress appear unwilling to deepen Brazil's crisis amid the pandemic, sources say.
 The Health Ministry said on Wednesday that the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Brazil had doubled in five days to 6,836, with the death toll almost tripling to 240.
 In the face of the climbing figures, Bolsonaro's appeals to 'Keep Brazil going' on social media (#BrasilNaoPodeParar) have stirred outrage in Congress.
 On Monday, the government's own chief whip Senator Fernando Bezerra led a motion in the Senate urging Brazilians to adhere to social distancing rules set out by Mandetta based on World Health Organization guidelines.
 "The President's view is wrong," said Senator Major Olimpio, once Bolsonaro's most faithful lieutenant in Congress, told Reuters. Olimpio said all parties in Congress oppose Bolsonaro's bid to relax social distancing recommendations.
 "This is extremely counterproductive, because he is making it appear to Brazilian society like a political party issue."
 For Jimena Blanco, head of Americas Risk Insights at Verisk Maplecroft consultancy, mounting calls for impeachment as the epidemic worsens raise the danger of a cabinet breakdown this month and the collapse of the government's reform agenda.
 "Fear of an increased militarization of the government, however, could act as a strong counterweight to any move by his opponents to have him removed, as it could lead to an even more hard-line right-wing administration," Blanco said.
 FEAR OF A DEPRESSION
 Even before coronavirus struck, Brazil's $1.8 trillion economy was unlikely to eke out more than anemic growth this year. And with 40% of Brazil's workforce in the informal sector, prolonged quarantines would dramatically raise poverty levels - including among Bolsonaro's supporters.
 To cushion the economy from the epidemic, the government is planning a 200 billion reais ($38 billion) package to safeguard jobs and help companies pay wages.
 Analysts say Bolsonaro's focus on the economy is driven by fear that a depression could leave millions of Brazilians unemployed and scuttle his 2022 re-election plans.
 "He knows that a stalled economy will be blamed on him, and if there is social unrest and looting too," said Lucas de Aragao, partner at Brasilia consultancy Arko Advice.
 Yet, the strategy is a major political gamble.
 For the past two weeks, Brazilians across the country have beaten pots and pans nightly against his stance in a traditional Latin American style of protest.
 Just 35% of Brazilians called Bolsonaro's handling of the health crisis "good" or "great," according to a Datafolha poll last week, compared to 55% support for Mandetta's performance, in line with approval of state governors, who have taken decisive measures.
 Espirito Santo state governor Renato Casagrande, of the opposition Brazilian Socialist Party, said Bolsonaro's statements were hindering his efforts to get Brazilians to stay safely at home: "He needs to get his act together or his political isolation will endanger his presidency."
 Joao Doria, the center-right governor of Sao Paulo, Brazil's most populous state and the worst affected by coronavirus, has emerged as a likely presidential rival by upbraiding Bolsonaro publicly for dividing Brazilians instead of leading a nation in crisis.
 Even within Brazil's powerful pro-gun caucus, whose members were among the loudest supporters of Bolsonaro's law-and-order campaign in 2018, there is opposition to his position.
 "He does have a valid concern over unemployment, which economists say could double to 20 million out of work," said Capitao Augusto, a former military policeman turned congressman. "But right now social distancing is needed in Brazil and the whole world."
 Opposition parties are accusing the president of criminal action by flaunting public health recommendations and appearing in public to shake hands with supporters, setting a dangerous example.
 The Supreme Court has upheld the right of governors to decide on restrictions in their states to fight coronavirus over and above the president's authority.
 One justice on the top court asked Brazil's top prosecutor to investigate Bolsonaro's behavior during the epidemic, following accusations he put the population at greater risk of getting COVID-19.
 And on Tuesday, Justice Roberto Barroso issued an injunction banning government propaganda encouraging Brazilians to go back to work using the social media tag #BrasilNaoPodeParar.
 Wealthy businessman Joao Amoedo, who founded the libertarian Novo party that backed Bolsonaro's election, expressed the frustration of Brazil's political class at the president's misreading of the crisis.
 "He has to come up with a plan, recognize the gravity of the situation, show balance and common sense. Or else resign," Amoedo said on Twitter. (Reporting by Lisandra Paraguassu, Ricardo Brito, Maria Carolina Marcello and Anthony Boadle Editing by Daniel Flynn and Alistair Bell)
