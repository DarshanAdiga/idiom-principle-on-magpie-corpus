While stress may be unavoidable in life, coping with the stress, confrontation of the stressors, and refection may all help to minimise your stress response. Try regular exercise to improve your mental health and find techniques such as mindfulness, journaling and being thankful to help you get through challenging times. Aim to optimise and support your microbiota, eat fermented food such as kefir, steer clear of the high-fat, high sugar foods where possible, and instead choose a healthy balanced diet of wholegrains, fruit, vegetables and healthy fats.

Dos hermanos de 18 y 19 años fueron detenidos por amenazar con arma de fuego a vecinos del barrio San Agustín, de esta ciudad.   Luego se concretó un allanamiento y se secuestró un arma de fabricación casera, cartucho 9 milímetros, atributos de Gendarmería y Ejército, tres plantines de marihuana y germinaciones recientes.   Días atrás, efectivos de la Comisaría Seccional Tercera tomaron conocimiento a través de varias denuncias de vecinos del barrio San Agustín de esta ciudad, que dos jóvenes amenazaban con arma de fuego al vecindario, realizaban actos vandálicos, organizaban fumatas y provocaban temor e intranquilidad, más aún por el peligro que representa la utilización de un arma de fuego.   Ante las denuncias, los policías iniciaron la investigación, mediante un trabajo articulado entre la Comisaría Tercera y la Brigada de la Unidad Regional Uno, quienes acudieron al barrio y realizaron relevamientos, tareas de observación y obtención de testimonios de vecinos.   Con los datos recabados, se estableció que ambos jóvenes son hermanos, conocidos por estar involucrados en varias causas por delitos contra la propiedad y las personas.   Todos los elementos de prueba fueron puestos a conocimiento del Juzgado de Instrucción y Correccional N° 2 de la Primera Circunscripción Judicial de la Provincia, quien valoró las pruebas y otorgó la orden de allanamiento para la vivienda.   Con la orden judicial en mano, se conformó una comisión policial integrada por efectivos de la Comisaría Tercera, Brigada de la Unidad Regional Uno (UR-1), con la cobertura de una Sección del Destacamento Desplazamiento Rápido (DDR), Dirección General de Drogas Peligrosas y Dirección de Policía Científica.   El allanamiento se realizó en la tarde del jueves en una vivienda del barrio San Agustín, donde se procedió a la detención de dos hermanos de 18 y 19 años, más el secuestro de un arma de fuego de fabricación casera (tumbera) adaptada para la utilización de cartuchos 9 milímetros, cartuchos del mismo calibre y atributos de Gendarmería Nacional y Ejército Argentino.   También encontraron tres plantines de marihuana y germinaciones recientes de la misma planta, cuyo test de orientación química arrojó positivo para marihuana.   El hallazgo fue informado vía telefónica al Juez de Instrucción y Correccional contra el Narcocrimen, quien dispuso la imputación a los dos hombres y la sustanciación de una causa paralela.   Durante el procedimiento una mujer y una menor de 17 años, familiares de los detenidos, pretendieron en todo momento entorpecer el mandamiento judicial, situación por la cual fueron aprehendidas.   Los dos hombres, la mujer, la menor y los secuestros fueron trasladados a la unidad operativa, donde se produjo la notificación de la situación legal en la causa de “Amenaza con el Uso de Arma de Fuego” y otra por “Infracción a la Ley 23737” dándose intervención a ambos magistrados.   Los hombres fueron alojados en celdas de esa Comisaría. La mujer fue alojada en la Unidad Penitenciaria Provincial N° 2; en tanto la menor fue entregada a su madre en carácter de guarda tutelar, previo notificarle que se encuentra imputada en la causa.   De esta manera, se puso fin al accionar de estos hermanos, procedimiento que fue destacado, reconocido y valorado por los vecinos, quienes depositaron su confianza en los servidores públicos y en la justicia, lo que devolvió la paz y la tranquilidad en el barrio.

Trent Boult and Bumrah had dismantled CSK top order on Friday. Boult started the attack in the very first over itself and Bumrah wreaked havoc in the second over with CSK getting reduced to 3/3. Boult and Bumrah derailed the top-half of the Chennai innings before the completion of the powerplay. With CSK losing the first wicket in the first over itself, Ambati Rayudu came into bat at number three. The last time these two teams met in the ongoing IPL, Rayudu was the top scorer and had won the game for CSK.

George Wilfred Boyes passed away peacefully on September 30, 2020 surrounded by the loving voices of his family and mere steps away from where he was born on August 26, 1922 at St. Joseph's Hospital. Dad was raised on the family homestead located on Shebandowan Lake where four generations continue to preserve this family legacy. He was the youngest of 8 children and predeceased by his parents, John and Elizabeth Boyes (nee Pernu), his sisters, Bella, Rose, Kate and Jenny and his brothers Walter, Rupert, Ernie, his niece Arlene Robertson (nee Ferguson) and his nephew Ken Boyes.Leaving the family homestead at the age of 19, George found work at the Port Arthur Ship Yards and grain elevators and then worked for more than 38 years at CrownZellerbach Paper Company where he served as a Regional Manager and retired in 1981. Following his retirement, he started a new career as a travel agent with Kernahan Travel until his beloved wife Mildred Helen Boyes (nee Sheppard) took ill and passed away in 1989. He enjoyed many close friendships over the years but his wife was the love of his life and was sorrowly missed.George was a man of great faith and spent the last 31 years of his life working in service to others. He volunteered with Shelter House for more than 20 years and worked with his "church family" at the Seventh Day Adventist Church caring for our most vulnerable citizens. He was always happiest when he was doing for others and frequently reminded us all of the "importance of having a positive attitude". He proudly served in the Canadian Armed Forces and St. Johns Ambulance for more than 12 years. He shared his love of nature and was a Boy Scout Leader for many years. Dad was member of the North West International Rowing Association and a life long member of the Thunder Bay Rowing Club. He often spoke of winning the coveted Lipton Cup for three consecutive years and was awarded the title of "Iron Man" in 1947. He loved music and played several instruments. He was a drummer for the MacGillvary Pipe Band and was honored by the organization for his 90th birthday celebration. In his final days, he loved to play his harmonica and keyboard to share his favourite tunes and hymns.George is survived by his children, Susanne, Deborah (Michael), Nancy (Gord) and Allan (Grace), 10 grandchildren, Tereza, Allison, Clayton, Alex, Christopher, Steven, Elizabeth, Andrea, Kevin and Karen and 4 great grandchildren, Katelyn, Liam, Quinn and Alexis. He is also survived by many nieces and nephews.The family expresses our deepest thanks to St. Joseph's Care Group, PR Cook Apartment staff and St. Hospital Hospice Unit staff for the loving care that Dad received in the final months and hours of his life. A memorial service and interment will be held at a later date at Riverside Cemetery. If friends so desire, in lieu of flowers, donations to St. Joseph's Foundation or Shelter House would be greatly appreciated by the family.Online condolences may be made throughwww.nwfainc.com

PASSING JETER, JOINING BONDS
 Tampa Bay's Randy Arozarena homered in the ninth to pass Derek Jeter for the most postseason hits by a rookie with 23. It was also his eighth homer this postseason, tying Barry Bonds (2002 with San Francisco), Carlos Beltran (2004 with Houston) and Nelson Cruz (2011 with Texas) for the most in a single postseason.
 "The hits to pass Derek Jeter mean more," Arozarena said through an interpreter. "It's good to be up in that group with those big hitters, Barry Bonds. But I stand alone with the hits."
 Arozarena is hitting .354, and the 23 hits are tops in the majors this postseason. His 15 runs are second to LA's Corey Seager (16).
 2-OUT RUNS
 The Dodgers scored five of their six runs in Game 3 with two outs, and now have 48 runs in that situation this postseason -- more than any team since the wild-card era began in 1994, when an extra playoff round was added.
 In their 6-2 win over the Tampa Bay Rays, the Dodgers surpassed the record 46 two-out runs by the 2004 Boston Red Sox, also overtaking the 2002 San Francisco Giants and 2018 Red Sox with 45 each.
 "Just not giving up. Obviously there's two outs, but you can still build an inning not giving away at-bats. That's how you win a World Series," said Dodgers right fielder Mookie Betts, who was part of the Red Sox when they beat Los Angeles in the World Series two years ago.
 Betts knows how demoralizing that can be to the opposing team.
 "You're one out away and then a walk here, a single here, a double here and the next thing you know you've given up a few runs," Betts said. "It's hard to stop the bleeding."
 TURNER MATCHES THE DUKE
 Justin Turner hit his 11th career postseason homer, a solo shot in the first inning of Game 3, to tie Duke Snider for the franchise lead, according to MLB. He's already the club leader in career postseason hits, RBIs and doubles.
 Turner's 75th career postseason hit was a double that set up Max Muncy's two- run single in the third. It was also his third straight extra-base hit in the Series. He doubled in the eighth inning of a 6-4 loss in Game 2.
 All of Turner's postseason homers have come since he turned 30, putting him third on the list of players with homers at 30 or older, according to STATS. Nelson Cruz is the leader with 17, followed by Jim Edmonds with 13.
 Seager has seven homers this postseason, most in franchise history for a single postseason, and is tied with Steve Garvey on the club's career list with 10 postseason homers.
 NO GOLD GLOVE FOR KK
 Kevin Kiermaier knew the questions were coming, and had plenty of time to think about toning down his answers.
 The Tampa Bay center fielder still didn't hold back much when asked about not being among the three finalists for the American League Gold Glove at his position. He's a three-time winner, most recently last season.
 "I was disappointed," he said. "I was upset. I feel like what I did defensively was underappreciated this year. I wasn't flawless by any means, but I thought I was darn good out there. I'm not going to lose any sleep over it, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't upset about it."
 The AL finalists are Minnesota's Byron Buxton, the 2017 winner, Oakland's Ramon Laureano and Chicago White Sox rookie Luis Robert.
 "Not even being a nominee for top three, that's where I had to scratch my head a few times and think it over," Kiermaier said.
 Kiermaier said he found out about not being among the finalists on Twitter during the off day, and said several times he had more immediate issues at hand at the World Series.
 "But next year you'll definitely be hearing words from me that once again I have to prove to everyone out there who the best defensive center fielder in the major leagues is," Kiermaier said. "I'm going to work my butt off this offseason and display that next season to remind everyone of just that."
 His manager won't be among those waiting for a reminder.
 "As far as I'm concerned, he's the best defensive player on whatever field he's on," Kevin Cash said. "Those guys are really good. I saw the list of everybody. I just think KK, you know, there should be a bigger award, a higher award. He'd probably get that one."
 FOUR ACROSS
 Cash had four outfielders a few times in the first few games, including when Will Smith hit it over all of them for a solo homer to left field off reliever Nick Anderson in Game 2.
 "It's a combination of what the hitter does and what our pitchers are capable of doing," Cash said. "And there's enough information that we trust that more times than not, this guy's going to hit the ball in the air off a specific pitcher."
 Cash also described the approach as another version of no-doubles defense, trying to cover the gaps.
 "They're just playing the numbers," Smith said. "My approach doesn't really change when that happens. I'm still trying to get a pitch I can drive. In certain situations, might try to hit more of a groundball."
 HOMETOWN FEEL
 With the Rays taking over as home team in Game 3 of the neutral-site series at the home of the Texas Rangers, Tampa Bay director of game presentation and production Michael Weinman sent content to the Rangers for the video boards.
 Games 3-4-5 were to have a Rays home game feel, and Weinman was to be on a headset during the game with the Rangers production team to help schedule Tampa Bay's normal home game features.

Everything had to cross over, and both those stories needed to make sense from the point of view of the characters in the story in both directions. You kind of had to play it backwards with the reverse character's point of view and make sure that all the events still worked in both directions.

WASHINGTON (AP) — While much of Washington is twisted in knots over the upcoming election, there’s another contingent already busy trying to figure out how to stage an inauguration for the to-be-determined next president during a pandemic.Visitors to the U.S. Capitol and the White House can already see preparations underway for the Jan. 20 ceremony, a date set by the 20th Amendment to the Constitution, for whoever emerges as the winner. And low-flying helicopters are swooping around town as part of beefed-up security precautions.Construction work is taking place with the mindset that it is easier to scale down, if the coronavirus makes that necessary, than to scale up, said Paige Waltz, a spokesperson for the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies.The committee has voted to hold the inaugural ceremonies on the West Front of the Capitol, a tradition that began under Ronald Reagan. The Architect of the Capitol is busy constructing the inaugural platform from scratch. The platform traditionally holds more than 1,600 people, including the president and vice president, members of Congress, Supreme Court justices, and the outgoing president and vice president. Bleachers above the platform hold 1,000 additional people. The view from the West Front stretches the length of the National Mall, where Americans from around the country gather to catch a glimpse of history.But in recognition that life has changed as a result of COVID-19, lawmakers are leaving all options on the table when it comes to safety precautions that could be taken. Will attendees be required to wear a mask? Or have their temperatures taken? Or social distance to the extent possible? Such precautions are being discussed, though no final determinations have been made with the ceremony still about three months away.Waltz said the six-member committee overseeing the inaugural ceremonies is “committed to traditional, inclusive, and safe ceremonies and will continue to monitor the situation and provide information as it comes available.”After the ceremony, the president and vice president will attend a luncheon in National Statuary Hall that includes speeches, gifts and toasts. The format used today began in 1953 when President Dwight D. Eisenhower and his wife and 50 other guests of the joint committee dined on creamed chicken, baked ham and potato puffs in the Old Senate Chamber.Then it’s on to the parade and inaugural balls. A Presidential Inaugural Committee, a nonprofit representing the president-elect, will be organized following the Nov. 3 election. The committee oversees inaugural events held away from the U.S. Capitol.In the meantime, the National Park Service is preparing for the construction of the reviewing and media stands used by the president-elect, his staff and family for the Presidential Inaugural Parade. It has closed a portion of Lafayette Park and the White House sidewalk to allow construction to begin.The Nuclear Security Administration, part of the Energy Department, has begun conducting low-altitude helicopter flights around the capital during the daytime. The department said the aircraft contain state-of-the art radiation-sensing technology, and the flights are part of standard preparations to protect public safety.For the Washington, D.C., metro area, the inauguration has traditionally provided an economic boost as visitors fill local hotels and restaurants. The 2021 inauguration comes at a difficult time for the district. Visitor spending was down 80%, or $6.9 billion, from March 8 to October 10, compared to the same period last year, according to Tourism Economics. That translated to $313 million in lost tax revenue for the District of Columbia.Many of the region’s restaurants are shuttered, while hotel room demand was down nearly 5 million rooms, or 83%, from the same time period in 2019, according to STR Inc., which tracks the hotel industry.“Traditionally, a second-term inauguration is not as big as the first, and if we have a new president taking office, numbers are typically larger,” said Elliott Ferguson, president and CEO of Destination DC, the district’s marketing organization. “However, visitation to Washington, D.C., during inauguration will depend on what people are able to do in the city based on COVID-19′s impact this winter, which remains to be seen.”Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Yes, it is important to take time, be still, and think about your current situation. However, in my experience, that causes me to get stuck in that mode which causes paralysis by analysis. At some point, there will be a time to move even if the plan is not completely ready. At least you will be trying and the concept of “failing fast” is real. I would rather fail five times when I am actively trying out concepts than trying to perfect my model on paper before I am willing to move. It actually costs less to fail fast and you will get the experience that you need to react better in the next situation.

Halloween, more than almost any other holiday, is about fun. It's like New Year's, but with corn syrup instead of booze.      It began with the Gaelic festival Samhain, which celebrated the end of harvest while ushering in the dark half of the year, a spooky time when the boundaries between the living and spirit worlds were thought to become more porous. Brought to America by Irish and Scottish settlers, Halloween found footholds in the southern colonies, and developed a more playful, mischievous, and decidedly corny vibe.      Candy corn didn't start out as a Halloween treat but jumped on the bandwagon in the 1950s, as Halloween pivoted into a full embrace of processed sugar.      Corn officially became spooky with the release of "Children of the Corn," a 1984 movie about a Midwestern village where the kids took over and decided nobody was permitted to age beyond 17. In 1993, the world's first for-profit corn maze was built in Annville, Pennsylvania. Since then the tradition has taken off, and corn mazes now number in the thousands.      When I lived in New Mexico I learned about chicos, a type of Native American dried corn. "Chicos" means "little boys" in Spanish, as the kernels shrink when dried. The ones for sale at the store were dried to the hardness of popcorn, but when I make them at home I let them stay a bit chewy, like real- life versions of candy corn. Each batch of chicos has a unique character, with different levels of brown, crunchiness, chewiness and/or sweetness, depending on the corn and how long it's roasted.      Many Halloween corn mazes are closed this year, thanks to COVID-19. And door- to-door candy-begging is largely out, too. If treat-seekers are left to their own devices I'm fine with that, because processed sugar is poison, and a tradition that hinges on giving candy to kids isn't worth rescuing.      So allow me to tell you how I make chicos. I made about three dozen ears' worth, which won't last too long but is a nice stash. I will follow my chicos tips with a few recipes, one sweet and one savory, for how I used them.      Chicos   The only ingredient is corn, preferably with the husk on. Traditionally, the process involves a clay oven or "horno," but other ovens work, too. Ultimately, you're doing little more than drying out corn.      Although usually made with fresh corn, I've also made chicos with frozen corn, and the operation was surprisingly successful, even if the product lacked the soulful smokey flavor that a roasted corn husk imparts.      Turn the oven to 300 F and place the ears directly on the oven racks, not touching one another, and bake until the husks start to dry out and brown and even smoke a little, about three hours. When cool, peel off the husks. If using husked or frozen corn, skip this step.      Turn oven down to 225. Put the cobs on the oven racks, spaced so as not to touch one another, and bake until the kernels start to shrink and visibly dry out, about four hours. Let the ears cool completely, and rub off the kernels -- use the edge of a spoon if they are stubborn. Store in a plastic bag in a cool, dry place. The drier you get them, the longer they will store.      If making chicos from frozen corn, spread the kernels on a cookie sheet and bake at 225. They will take less time -- about two hours -- and will quickly turn brown and then black.      Chicos and Milk   Fill a bowl with chicos and milk, with sugar to taste. When the chicos are gone and you sip the sweet milk that remains, you may feel a distinct deja vu to a time, long ago, when you sipped the sweet leftover milk from a bowl of corn flakes or Frosted Flakes.      Beans with Chicos   A handful of chicos turns a pot of beans into something interesting and delightful. Served alongside rice, you've got a delicious meal with complete protein.   Serves 2   • 1 strip bacon (optional, recommended), chopped   • 1 tablespoon olive oil if skipping the bacon or if it's lean   • ½ cup minced onions   • 1 clove garlic, minced   • 1 teaspoon minced fresh oregano or thyme   • ¼ cup chicos   • 1 can plain beans (pinto, white, black, kidney) including the liquid   • 1 can water or stock   • 1 teaspoon paprika or chile powder to taste   • Salt, if the bacon doesn't add enough   Fry the bacon on medium heat. When half-crispy, about five minutes, add the onions, garlic and herbs. Fry until the onions become translucent. Add the chicos, beans, water and paprika, and stir together. Season with salt, if necessary. Heat to a simmer, stirring as necessary to prevent sticking. Adjust seasoning and serve.

If you have been thinking about selling but have not consulted with your CPA, that would be your first step to take. Your CPA will explore other options that might benefit you more in the long run. For example, not everyone is prepared to be a landlord or a property manager, although there might be some financial benefits to holding your property until there is a stepped-up cost basis. Discuss with your trusted advisor.

I love the idea of a social impact company. For years, I donated to organizations on my own and I didn’t talk about it as I am not much of a self- promoter. However, once the team understood that giving was a big part of what I did, we structured our business around the fact that we want to do well by doing good. We put a name to charities we support, talk to the doctors about why we give, and put goals on paper about how much we want to give. Each year, we want to give 5% of our gross revenue to our charitable partners and this year our partner is Give Back a Smile, which is the charitable arm of the American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry. It was our largest recipient last year and the dentists we work with love their mission.
