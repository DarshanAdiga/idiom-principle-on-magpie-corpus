At the moment when the city was first locked down, I hoped with all my heart that China's political system, known for concentrating resources to get big jobs done, could save the Wuhanese. But infected patients were treated in the hospital in Wuhan as early as the beginning of December, and for unknown reasons, the government held off informing the public and taking effective action.
 So they missed the best window of prevention due to this cover-up.
 That knowledge has made me fall into desperation. The order to lock down the city appeared from nowhere on Jan. 23 at 2 a.m., without any sign or explanation to residents — even though everyone knew what was up.
 People rushed to shop at 24-hour convenience stores at 3 a.m. to gather necessary food and other items. We tried every method to escape from Wuhan, but the cage was already locked.
 On new year's eve, Jan. 24, I watched the glorious performances from a gala aired on CCTV, Chinese television. But our celebratory meal was sparse, pieced together from the few ingredients I'd been able to buy in that last-minute shopping trip.
 Then on the second day of the new year, another order arrived out of the blue, notifying us that the Wuhanese shall not drive. But this order only survived for less than six hours — perhaps because the authorities realized that, with public transportation shut down, cars would be needed to drive medical staffers to work and back home. So community officers called upon residents of Wuhan to provide rides for many of these workers — and to get permits to do this driving. Under the pressure of massive criticism, the government had to revoke this order for residents to provide rides.
 Other orders were issued that reflected the chaos. Residents were asked to donate rice and oil to feed the medical staffers at Wuhan's top hospital since there was not enough food to guarantee meals for them. But we are the taxpayers. Shouldn't the government be able to provide?
 From former schoolmates who now work in the medical profession, I learned that medical workers were not given medical supplies and were exposed to a risk of death. Many people wonder: Why didn't they go on strike? It is because they were informed that if they went on strike, their licenses to practice medicine would be revoked and their family members' jobs would be affected.
 Before this coronavirus, I always thought it was OK to sacrifice some level of democracy and freedom for better living conditions. But now I have changed my attitude. Without democracy and freedom, the truth of the outbreak in Wuhan would never be known.

Technical chart claims that Chico's FAS, Inc. (CHS) would settle between $4/share to $4.2/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $3.63 mark, then the market for Chico's FAS, Inc. becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $3.45 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -0.13. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

Marcus Joseph and Victor Perez scored for their teams as Gokulam Kerala played out an entertaining 1-1 draw with Kolkata giants East Bengal in Kozhikode on Tuesday. Joseph broke the deadlock in the ninth minute before Perez's penalty in the 24th levelled the scores. The hosts went down to 10 men in the second half, before being reduced to nine players minutes before the full-time whistle. However, they showed great resilience to hold on. Gokulam gaffer Fernando Santiago Valera showed faith in his XI that earned a point against Punjab and named an unchanged side for the evening, while QEB Head Coach Mario Rivera reflected two alterations.
 Gurwinder Singh replaced Asheer Akhtar at the back, while Kassim Aidara made his return to the line-up.
 It was Gokulam who came all guns blazing after kick-off and caught the visitors napping on a couple of occasions in the first 15 minutes.
 It took the hosts only nine minutes to go in front through skipper Joseph, who had a crack from just outside the box and found the back of the net.
 The visitors found their way back into the game in the 24th minute, when Juan Mera's mazy run was recklessly intercepted by Naocha Singh inside the box, conceding a penalty and his first yellow card of the game.
 New signing Victor Perez stepped up for the spot-kick and converted successfully to restore parity for QEB.
 The tempo of the game dropped a couple of beats following the equaliser, as either side struggled to penetrate for the remainder of the half.
 Marcos Jimenez De La Espada had a crack from distance, which wasn't far away for a speculative strike but that's how it remained going into the break, a goal apiece.
 Gokulam made a horrendous start to the second half as they went down to 10 men.
 Naocha Singh was given his marching orders as he was shown a second yellow and subsequently, a red card for yet another bookable offence.
 The hosts showed resilience despite going a man down and continued to threaten and test EB's resistance.
 Nathaniel Garcia's immaculate long ball found Joseph, who could only get a head to the end of the delivery, but Mirshad was well-positioned to collect.
 On the break, Abhash Thapa went on a solo run and after having made his way inside the Gokulam box, forced a quality save out of Ubaid.
 In the 72nd minute, Juan Mera showcased his flamboyance by making yet another delightful run, completely leaving Andre Etienne at bay and when he had the opportunity to shoot, went for an audacious chip over the keeper instead.
 To his agony, the woodwork came to Ubaid's rescue.
 Salman, in the 81st minute, seemed to have done everything right with his right-footed curler but Mirshad made amends for his earlier error and produced an excellent save to tip it over the bar.
 10-men Gokulam almost it won it at the death when substitute Lalromawia's perfectly placed shot found the back of the net to send the home crowd over the fence, but the celebrations were short-lived since the linesman had his flag up for offside.
 Protesting the decision, Haroon Amiri was shown his second yellow card of the day, as Gokulam ended up with nine men, minutes before the full-time whistle was blown.
 East Bengal remain at fourth place with 20 points, while Gokulam Kerala rise a place above to sixth with 19.

When Arcadia resident Omar Noureldin arrived at the vote center at the Ace Hotel in downtown Los Angeles, the queue of people waiting to cast ballots stretched down two flights of stairs. By the time he left, there was a line out the door, he said.
 “Those people that are in line around the corner are probably going to be there for three hours — if they wait,” he said.
 Noureldin took advantage of an election shortcut offered under the new system: Ballot selections can be filled out on a smartphone ahead of time and then transferred to the touchscreen machines with a QR code. The biggest issue he experienced on Tuesday, he said, was the lack of staff and voting machines at the center. He said there were only two volunteers and four functional machines by the time he cast his ballot. His post on Twitter about the experience sparked a reply from county elections officials that they would send help to that location.
 Two of the six voting machines at the Eagle Rock Recreation Center were out of order by the time Christian Donovan arrived to vote early Tuesday morning.

She is investigating a series of mysterious deaths. On the face of it, there is nothing to connect them. It is not even clear that some of them are murders. But some years back, Malcolm had written a post for the store's blog listing his choices for the eight most foolproof murders in crime fiction. Among them: Agatha Christie's "The A.B.C. Murders," James M. Cain's "Double Indemnity" and Patricia Highsmith's "Strangers on a Train." Mulvey has a gut feeling that someone is using Malcolm's list as a script.
