I'll be honest, writing for the _Carillon_ has had its fair share of difficulties, including always finding the time to research and write two articles every week, waiting for responses from people, errors in publication [ _EIC’s note: my bad]_ and of course struggling to find the right words to express my thoughts. Despite these challenges, writing for the _Carillon_ has enabled me to not only improve my writing, but also learn more about myself and what is important to me.

Nine schools in Rockingham County are being used as meal pickup sites twice a week since students were told they would not be returning to the classroom in mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 After offering meals every day during the first week of March 16, Rockingham County Public Schools has gone to a twice-weekly pickup where a number of meals can be given out all at once, said Gerald Lehman, director of food service for the school division.
 Since then, demand has not declined, and the school division is working through its store of food it had on-hand before COVID-19, and it is working with local partners Sysco, PET Milk, and Standard Produce to continue to provide meals for students.

Whether its the kitchen sink or your shower, a clogged drain can cause all sorts of problems and is a big inconvenience in your home. Many people would panic and call a handyman, but STOP! A clogged sink can be fixed quickly and easily with ingredients you may have in the cupboard — baking soda and vinegar. Simply pour some boiling water down the drain and then a generous amount of baking soda, letting that sit for a few minutes. Once this has sat, add a mixture of vinegar and hot water down the drain and cover it to let the reaction take place. Within 5-10 minutes, you will have a full functioning drain again. Simple as that!

While there also is potential for the fireworks to be canceled, Baldwin said there isn't a date set for that decision to made and it will be at least 30 days before the topic is revisited.
 The chamber's Facebook post on Monday stated, "On behalf of our chamber board, committee members, and administrative team, we are deeply saddened that during this unprecedented uncertainty, this decision is not just a necessary and right step, it is the only step. As we were monitoring the COVID-19 crisis over these last several weeks, our ultimate goal of keeping our community as safe as possible during this shutdown and uncertainties of this virus."
 With the festival relying on local businesses and chamber members for sponsorships, the post said in light of the economic impact this pandemic is having it didn't make sense to ask these businesses and entities for money. For those sponsors who have already committed money, the chamber's post requested they consider using it to help fund the fireworks display or future events such as the classic car cruise or the Festival of the Pines.
 The chamber also will offer refunds if the sponsor opts not to support those other events.
 "On behalf of all of us, we share a common feeling of disappointment about this necessary cancellation. We know the festival will emerge from this challenging moment, and we are eager to see you all in July 2021, when we will celebrate our annual community event together again," the post said. "We will continue to communicate our decision to neighbors, annual visitors, including Michigan Festivals and the public media. We will ensure that the many volunteers and sponsors are contacted directly in the coming days.

For Willy S., the solution was to create a virtual recovery meeting. He started out by attending several online meetings in rapid succession to see how they worked, then launched his own meeting using word of mouth and posting about it on Facebook recovery groups. Now between fifteen and thirty people join him over video-conferencing app Zoom.
 The virtual meetings follow the same format Willy S. adopted for facilitating in-person meetings, which he began volunteering to do within the first few months of getting sober. "Once you get used to the feeling of talking to a computer, you can realize you're there to do the same thing as an in-person meeting," he says. "I go to meetings to share a solution and help the still- suffering addict or alcoholic. That's why I'm on my computer every night doing the same thing. It just looks different."

Larsen & Toubro (L&T) has got an order worth around ₹5,000 crore from the Indian Army to establish a first of its kind, state of the art unified network management system to manage, support and operate the countrywide armed forces network being set up under the unified Network for Spectrum (NFS) project, the company said on Tuesday.


  “It involves creating a centralised network monitoring, management and control system for all the seven layers under the NFS, which interconnects 414 defence stations,” said S.N. Subrahmanyan, CEO and Managing Director, L&T.


  “This is an extremely crucial and sensitive project for the Ministry of Defence and we are proud that the Ministry has reposed their faith in our technical, engineering and solutioning capabilities to execute this project”, he said in a statement.


  ## To be done in 18 months


  The project is to be implemented in 18 months, followed by three years of warranty and seven years of Annual Maintenance Contract (AMC), during which L&T will provide managed maintenance services, including service- level agreement monitoring, service impact analysis and root cause analysis of the countrywide armed forces next generation network.


  The statement said the project involved the creation of a resilient Cloud based IT infrastructure on a infrastructure as a service (IAAS) model. The scope also includes next generation operations system and software (NGOSS) based unified network management system; eight Network Operations Centers (NOCs) consisting of national NOCs, disaster recovery NOCs and regional NOCs,


  The facilities under this project -- security operation centres, tier III data centres and training infrastructure -- would allow real-time monitoring of the complete IT network backbone of the Army and provide complete visibility of the deployed network assets, leading to optimal utilisation of the resources, L&T said.

Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani on Tuesday conducted an online workshop for district child protection units wherein discussions were held on coronavirus-related issues and ways to reduce stress during the ongoing lockdown. Mental health experts and Irani interacted with the participants and answered their questions, the Women and Child Development (WCD) Ministry said in a series of tweets in Hindi.


  "Under the leadership of Hon'ble Minister Smriti Irani, an online orientation workshop was organised for district-based child protection units during which discussions were held on issues related to coronavirus and how stress can be reduced during lockdown and the role of childline," it said. Experts, including child psychiatrist at NIMHANS Shekhar Sesadri, answered questions from ministry and state officials, district child protection units, child welfare committees, juvenile justice board members and supervisors of child care institutions, it added.


  Irani assured the participants of all possible help and cooperation from the government. "More than 850 people related to child protection services took part in the workshop and many watched it on YouTube," the ministry said.


  Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a 21-day nationwide lockdown on March 24 to contain the spread of coronavirus. The lockdown, the world's biggest, came into effect on March 25 midnight. India has reported 4,421 coronavirus cases so far, according to the Union Health Ministry.

For the time being, however, the main benefit of dedicating space to buses is that it will speed up people’s travel.


  Take the B44, for instance. Rather than running southbound service on Nostrand Ave. and northbound service on Rogers or New York Aves., depending on whether or not you are on the Select Bus, it would be better for _all_ service to run on Nostrand Ave. so that passengers can connect to the intersecting subways along the route without walking an extra block or two.

This is because it is hard for the air to get through the debris that has built up and so this causes the unit to have to take up more energy to do its jobs, ultimately increasing your energy bills.

Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi suggesting five measures to save money for the fight against COVID-19, including suspension of Central Vista beautification project and complete ban on media advertisements by government for two years. She also called for putting on hold foreign visits by the President, Vice president and Union ministers as well as chief ministers of states and bureaucrats, and slashing the government's expenditure budget, other than salaries, pensions and central sector schemes, by 30 per cent.


  The suggestions came after Modi reached out to several opposition leaders, including Gandhi, on Monday and sought suggestions from them in fighting the fast-spreading coronavirus, which has claimed at least 114 lives and infected over 4,400 people in the country. "Austerity measures which can be used to divert much needed funds to the fight against COVID-19 are the need of the hour. In this spirit, I am writing to offer five concrete suggestions. I am certain you will find value in them," Gandhi said in her letter to the prime minister.


  She assured the prime minister of unwavering support of the Congress in meeting the grave challenge of COVID- 19 facing the country. "Impose a complete ban on media advertisements -- television, print and online -- by the Government and Public Sectors Undertakings (PSU's) for a period of two years. The only exceptions should be advisories for COVID-19 or for issues relating to public health," she said.


  Gandhi said the central government currently spends Rs 1,250 crore per year on media advertisements, she said, adding that this will free up a substantial amount to alleviate the economic and social impacts of the virus outbreak. "Suspend the Rs 20,000 crore 'Central Vista' beautification and construction project forthwith. At a time like this, such an outlay seems self-indulgent to say the least. I am certain that Parliament can function comfortably within the existing historical buildings," Gandhi told Modi.


  There is no urgent or pressing requirement that cannot be postponed until this crisis is contained, she noted. Gandhi said every Indian has made personal sacrifices to fight this disease, but "it is time that the Legislature and the Executive reciprocate this trust and good faith".


  BJP leader Subramanian Swamy had yesterday said, "I have welcomed the MPs' pay cut by 30 pc for a year. I also think the Rs 25,000 crore new Parliament building construction should be postponed for a year too." The Congress president said this sum could instead be allocated towards constructing new hospital infrastructure and diagnostics along with equipping our frontline workers with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) gears and facilities. She also called for transferring all money under the 'PM Cares' fund to the 'Prime Minister's National Relief Fund' to ensure efficiency, transparency and accountability.


  These funds, plus the amount in PM-Cares can be utilised to ensure an immediate food security net for those at the very margins of society. Gandhi said by reducing 30 per cent expenditure of the Centre, it will yield around Rs 2.5 lakh crore per year which can be allocated towards establishing an economic safety net for migrant workers, labourers, farmers, MSMEs and those in the unorganised sector.


  She said an amount of Rs 393 crore was spent for just the Prime Minister and Union Cabinet members' trips in the last five years and the amount can be utilised extensively in measures to combat COVID-19. She, however, said exceptions on foreign visits can be made in case of special exigencies in national interest to be cleared by the prime minister. The Union cabinet on Monday decided to cut 30 per cent salary of all MPs for one year and divert MPLADS funds for two years to fund the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.


  The President, the Vice President, governors of states have also voluntarily decided to take a pay cut as a social responsibility..

2\. The letter from MCM and the video conferencing failed to provide clear evidence of what has happened that would trigger MCM citing Force Majeure. Fluctuations to the copper price are a constant in the mining sector and cannot reasonably be classified as “Events” beyond the control of the company. The price of copper per Tonne has been fluctuating for many years. MCM came to Zambia in the year 2000. Between the year 2000 and today, the price of Copper has fluctuated from as low as US$2000 to US$9900 per Tonne. It is therefore surprising that the price of Copper can be cited as one of the reasons necessitating the need to claim ‘Force majeure’ because the current price is about US$4,800 per Tonne. This Price is not as low as some years when it was as low as US$2000 per Tonne. It is therefore shocking that this circumstance of copper being at US$4,800 Per Tonne can reasonably be considered as beyond the control of MCM, which had weathered worse price fluctuations in the past. This is clearly not ‘AN ACT OF GOD” but a normal business trend.
