Yet there we were, red, screaming and very much alive, though not without complication. We would spend the first eight weeks of our lives in the NICU, jaundiced and premature, impossibly small.

VACAVILLE, Calif. (AP) — Firefighters hard-pressed by some of the largest wildfires in California history scrambled Wednesday to take advantage of cooler weather and an influx of aid as they carved and burned containment lines around the flames to prevent more land from burning.“Every percent of containment is hours and hours of sweat and blood up on those lines,” Jonathan Cox, a deputy chief with California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said Tuesday evening.Progress was made on three major blazes around the San Francisco Bay Area and authorities were making plans to allow people who evacuated fire-impacted communities to return to their homes.The fires, which started as clusters of lightning-sparked blazes last week, slowed down at lower altitudes as a morning marine layer — an air mass drawn from the ocean by intense heat on land — brought cooler temperatures and higher humidity. The cooler air, however, didn’t reach the higher forest and rural areas full of heavy timber and brush.“The return of the marine layer has been a welcomed one,” the National Weather Service said early Wednesday.Amid the good news there were sobering developments.A fire in San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties south of San Francisco was 19% contained but damage assessments raised the number of buildings destroyed to more than 530.Santa Cruz County officials reported that a woman who hadn’t been heard from since Monday was found dead at home, apparently due to natural causes. They also were looking for an evacuee missing since he told a friend he wanted to sneak back in.Residents were urged to be patient by Billy See, the incident commander of that fire.“When the smoke starts to clear, all the residents get very restless about trying to get back in and wanting to know when the evacuation orders and warnings will be lifted,” See said.Authorities were working on a strategic plan for repopulating areas after ensuring that conditions were safe and there that there would be water service and electrical power for residents, he said.The massive fires — coming much earlier in the season than expected — have pushed firefighters to the breaking point as they dealt with complications from the coronavirus pandemic and a lack of inmate crews who assist firefighters.Some firefighters were shuttled to Northern California after battling earlier fires in Southern California.Tim Edwards, president of the union representing state firefighters, said 96% of the state's resources are committed to fighting the blazes. He was with a three-man fire engine crew that had traveled more than 400 miles (643 kilometers) from southern Riverside County to help fight wildfires in wine country north of San Francisco.“Between the fires in Southern California and these, they’ve been going nonstop,” he said. “Fatigue is really starting to set in, but they’re doing it.”Since Aug. 15, hundreds of fires have burned nearly 2,000 square miles (more than 5,000 square kilometers), an area roughly the size of Delaware.The blazes have killed at least seven people, burned about 1,500 homes and other buildings, and prompted evacuation orders that still affect about 140,000 people.David Serna, 49, a firefighter with the Presidio of Monterey Fire Department, was battling a fire in that county when his rented home in Santa Cruz County burned to the ground.“I wanted to get up to the house and see what was left. Got up there and nothing. It was all gone,” Serna told&nbsp;KTVU-TV.He and his wife did find a metal heart-shaped decoration from their wedding day.“All the years that I fought fires and seeing this type of destruction in other places,” Serna said. “But when it hits that close to home, it becomes almost unbelievable.”In the city of Vacaville, between San Francisco and Sacramento, 76-year-old Art Thomas said he found only ashes and melted metal at the site of the home he built with his own hands in a rural area where he had lived for 32 years.“Possessions dating back to when I was a kid were all in the house, everything is gone,” Thomas said. “Between sad, crying, laughing — every emotion is there.”He said he had left with his wife, two dogs and a pair of shorts and tennis shoes.With limited crews to tackle fires on the ground, California has been relying more on bulldozers, aircraft and firefighters from other states and the federal government, said Daniel Berlant, chief of wildfire planning and engineering for the state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire.About 300 National Guard troops were finishing firefighter training and were expected to be on the lines Wednesday as another 300 begin four days of training, said spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Shiroma.California has scrambled in recent years to field enough prison fire crews as their numbers dwindled while the state released lower-level inmates. Thousands more were released early as the state responded to the coronavirus pandemic.A dozen inmate firefighting camps that had been forced to shut down in June for two-week quarantines because of the coronavirus are back in operation but the total of 43 camps are operating at about 40% of capacity, said corrections department spokesman Aaron Francis.The challenge remains, however, as California heads into the fall. That's when searing weather and dry gusts have historically sparked some of the largest and deadliest fires.___Thompson reported from Sacramento.

"articleBody" : "Bollywood's firebrand Kangana Ranaut is back with another bomb… This time she picks 'Drugs' issue which was highlighted in Sushant Singh Rajput's case and tweets that she is willing to support the Narcotics department but seeks Central Government support…If narcotics Control Bureau enters Bullywood, many A listers will be behind bars, if blood tests are conducted many shocking revelations will happen. Hope @PMOIndia under swatchh Bharat mission cleanses the gutter called Bullywood.— Kangana Ranaut (@KanganaTeam) August 26, 2020It all started with this tweet, Kangana doled out that if blood tests are conducted, many Bollywood A-listers will be behind the bars and also suggested Central Government to clean the Bollywood under Swatchh Bharat mission.I was still a minor my mentor turned tormentor used to spike my drinks and sedate me to prevent me from going to cops, when I became successful and got entry in to the most famous film parties I was exposed to the most shocking and sinister world and drugs,debauchery and mafia.— Kangana Ranaut (@KanganaTeam) August 26, 2020In this tweet, she doled out that, her mentor in Bollywood used to spike her drinks and sedate her to stop going to Police in the starting of her career. Then after she became successful, she got to know more about the dark secrets after starting attending parties.Most popular drug in the film industry is cocaine, it is used in almost all house parties it's very expensive but in the beginning when you go to the houses of high and mighty it's given free, MDMA crystals are mixed in water and at times passed on to you without your knowledge.— Kangana Ranaut (@KanganaTeam) August 26, 2020In this tweet, she said Cocaine which is very expensive drug is used in almost all the parties. MDMA crystals will be mixed in the glass of water without one's knowledge.I am more than willing to help @narcoticsbureau but I need protection from the centre government, I have not only risked my career but also my life, it is quiet evident Sushanth knew some dirty secrets that's why he has been killed.— Kangana Ranaut (@KanganaTeam) August 26, 2020The story is still not done… In this tweet, she mentioned that, she is willing to support 'Narcotics' department but need support from Central Government as she is keeping her career and life at risk. She also doled out that, Sushant Singh is killed as he came to know a few dirty secrets… Through these series of tweets, she directly made a few allegations on Bollywood and asked Government to interrogate on 'Drugs' issue. We need to see how CBI tackles Sushant Singh's case and we need to wait and watch how the Central Government responds to Kangana's allegations. Kangana is supporting Sushant Singh's family from the starting and also creating a buzz on social media by targeting a few Bollywood biggies. Off late, there are allegations of Rhea Chakraborty that she was in direct contact with a few drug dealers. There are even speculations that, Sushant Singh was also a drug addict but we need to wait to know the complete truth. ",

“In the strong markets, the disconnect between wages and prices, plus a sizable down-payment requirement, creates a high barrier to first-time buyers,” she said. “If they want to relocate to secondary markets, they first have to make a lifestyle choice and a commitment to move.”
 Is now a good time to hop into the market? David Chapman, a professor of real estate at the University of Central Oklahoma, says it is a classic case of “yes and no.”
 “It depends,” he said. “Now is a good time to buy because of the low interest rates; however, the market has responded to those low interest rates with higher home prices. In my opinion, home prices are inflated.”
 And there is always the impact of the presidential election to consider.
 “Some believe, as I do, that if Joe Biden wins the presidential election, that Wall Street will experience a sell-off, interest rates will rise, and sellers will fear a recession and try to sell their properties, leading to a buyers’ market,” said John Featherman, an instructor at Temple University’s Real Estate Institute.
 “I also believe that, if Donald Trump wins re-election, prices will rise and the sellers’ market will continue,” he added. “So if buyers don’t have to buy now, I’m advising them to wait until after the presidential election.”
 (“This has nothing to do with how I feel about either candidate,” Featherman added, “simply how I feel that markets will react.”)
 But elections, and presidents, come and go, while real estate is eternal, and should not be seen in through a short-term, cable-news prism, experts say.
 “Like always, people should only buy if they plan to stay in the area/home for more than about four years,” Chapman said. “Always remember that real estate is local, and doesn’t get too carried away with national news.”

Money from the state, handed out to everybody, no questions asked. This idea, known as unconditional basic income, has fueled a passionate debate for years. One reason for the stridence of the discussion is the lack of a commonly accepted set of facts regarding the preconditions necessary and the broader societal effects it might produce. There are differing visions of its costs, how it might be financed, how to integrate the concept into modern welfare states and what it might do to the labor market.

For three years, 120 people are to receive 1,200 euros per month, and throughout the study period, they will be closely observed and frequently interviewed, as will the 1,380 members of the control group, who will receive no money.
 The hope is that the study will produce scientifically grounded knowledge on how the behavior and attitudes of people change when they regularly receive money with no strings attached. Will they grow lazy or creative? Will they work less or give up their jobs completely? Will they use the extra money only for themselves or will they become more engaged in volunteer work?

That would add almost a third to Liverpool's bottom line in wages, taking their yearly sum to £400m. As a result, Liverpool’s wage-to-income ratio would shift from 58 per cent to a whopping 75.
 Unsurprisingly, owners Fenway Sports Groups do not make a habit of smashing their wage structure for players approaching the twilight of their careers.
 Liverpool's highest-paid player currently is believed to be Mohamed Salah on £200,000 a week.
 He joined Luis Suarez as the most handsomely rewarded footballer in Anfield history when he penned a new contract in June 2018.
 There is also the issue of the club being hit hard by the three-month suspension of football between March and June when outgoings were significant and incomings were minimal.

Sherman’s position had become controversial in the last years of former County Administrator Craig Coffey’s tenure. She’d supposedly “retired” in 2018, as she was required to under state retirement system rules, but only to return the next day as a “consultant” and with a $12,500 raise.
