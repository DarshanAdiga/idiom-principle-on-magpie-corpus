No. There are no battalions of dead warriors from the Russo-American war. Because there never was such a war. I wonder why we can’t ask “why” on that one? Oh, I am sorry. It’s because Australian-American billionaires and golf playing American presidents protected us from the evil Putin and the war- hungry Ruskies! Yeah, I forgot.But why? Doesn’t every American wonder how we’ve managed to go nowhere in the more than seven decades since World War 2? Black lives still don’t matter in the US? And neither do, red, yellow, brown, Slavic, Celtic, Christian, or Muslim ones anywhere. And least of all, do Russian children matter – but why? When did Russia attack America? Where are the dead and buried in America’s wars with the USSR or Russia? Are the memorial cemeteries secret? Has the liberal order that’s run things hidden from us the very premise on which we base our almost religious fear and hatred of a people?

_" Substantially all of our land-based casino customers had to close their physical operations in March due to the global pandemic, which helped to drive an increase in online gaming. We saw a notable increase in Internet gaming win in both New Jersey and Pennsylvania for the months of March, April and May, and have seen a similar shift from retail gambling to online gambling in our other key market of Italy. While sports betting has been significantly impacted by the cancellation of most major sporting events, our sports betting business has historically been driven by the NFL season, which is anticipated to return with its first official game in September. Simulated gaming continues to be an immense opportunity for GAN, particularly as many retail gaming properties have been closed. We were pleased to announce new simulated gaming client wins, Penn National Gaming and the Snoqualmie Indian Tribe, and are working to secure several new client opportunities in our pipeline in both real money Internet gambling and simulated gaming in the remainder of 2020. It is an exciting time for GAN, and we look forward to capitalizing on the immense opportunity."_

France and India Thursday signed an agreement committing 200 million euros to increase the state and central governments' capacities to support India's most vulnerable people in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis.The credit financing agreement was signed by C.S. Mohapatra, Additional Secretary - Department of Economic Affairs, and Bruno Bosle, Director - AFD (French Development Agency) in India in the virtual presence of Emmanuel Lenain, Ambassador of France to India, according to a statement by French embassy.&quot;Through this loan, France will work with India to increase the state and central governments' capacities to support the country's most vulnerable people in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis,&quot; it said.The programme design, developed by the World Bank in collaboration with the Indian authorities, seeks to optimize and scale up the Indian Government's existing social protection measures, it said.&quot;Focusing on boosting the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojna, the programme will provide further benefits to low-income families to ensure that the health, social and economic shocks arising from Covid-19 do not endanger people's well-being or their contribution to the country's economic growth in the long run,&quot; it said.The programme also seeks to protect essential frontline workers of the pandemic, including those in healthcare, sanitation, and security, by providing them with health insurance. Social assistance programmes will also be put in place for migrant workers and low-income urban households that may be unable to seek compensation under PMGKY, it added.Recalling the importance France attaches to facing global challenges through multilateral cooperation, the Ambassador of France to India Lenain, said, President Macron and Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi have been working together so that the excellent relations between our two countries translate into concrete cooperation in the fight against Covid-19.&quot;The Indian Government's rollout of the PMGKY is a testament to its commitment to ensuring that the most vulnerable sections of society are protected, and it is this commitment that France, through the French Development Agency and its partners, is determined to support.Also, catch all the latest updates and trends on the novel coronavirus with CNBCTV18's blog.

An OPEC+ panel pressed countries such as Iraq and Kazakhstan on Thursday to comply better with oil cuts and left the door open for extending or easing record production curbs from August.The panel, known as the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC), advises OPEC+ and will meet again on July 15, when it would recommend the next level of cuts, designed to support oil prices battered by the coronavirus pandemic.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, have been cutting output since May by a record 9.7 million barrels per day (bpd) - or 10 percent of global supply - after oil demand plunged by up to a third.After July, the cuts are due to taper to 7.7 million bpd until December.Two OPEC+ sources said Thursday's virtual JMMC meeting didn't discuss extending record cuts beyond July.An OPEC+ statement also made no mention of such plans and said Iraq and Kazakhstan presented a plan for how to compensate for May overproduction in July-September.&quot;That could be an extra piece of bullish news for the market, which may see the two nations removing some supply,&quot; said Bjornar Tonhaugen from Rystad Energy. Nigeria, Angola and Gabon have been given until Monday to submit their plans.Compensations by laggards in future months mean that even if OPEC+ decides to ease cuts, in practice they will be deeper.Oil has recovered to above USD 41 a barrel from a 21-year low below USD 16 a barrel in April, helped by OPEC+ cuts and a recovery in demand as governments ease coronavirus lockdowns. Brent oil prices closed 2 percent higher on Thursday.&quot;The fact that not extending the deep cuts to August did not influence prices, shows that the levels we currently see are sustainable,&quot; said Tonhaugen.Saudi Arabia, OPEC's de facto leader, and Russia have to perform a balancing act of pushing up oil prices to meet budget needs while not driving them too high to avoid a resurgence of US shale production.Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Wednesday that Moscow was happy with the current oil price. US output has plunged by a record 2 million bpd, but there are signs it is recovering quickly.

JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - Customers dealing with water bill woes in the City of Jackson may soon see some relief.Senator John Horhn of District 26 wrote a bill that can help thousands of residents with their payment problems.“Senate Bill 2856... would allow the Public Works Department and other apartments of the City of Jackson to be able to set up alternative payment systems for rate payers who have excessively high water bills where there’s a possibility that it would be gained noncollectable,” said Horhn.The senator said he was approached by the city’s director of public works for legislative help. The bill passed unanimously by the House and Senate.City of Jackson councilman Aaron Banks hopes the bill will soon become law.“We’ve been having problems with collection. Some people aren’t even received. But then in cases when they do receive a bill all when there are inaccuracies, they get a bill that seven-thousand, five-thousand dollars. This does provide a base for the city to begin to put in the necessary policies and procedures,” said Banks.The city settled with Siemens Incorporated earlier this year over the troubled water system contract. But that settlement, along with this bill, are just part of the issues that need to be fixed.“We got a long ways to go because at the end of the day, the meters got to be fixed. And we got to get the software to read accurately. And the biggest problem is it’s all electronic or digital,” said Banks.Senator Horhn is confident the bill will be signed by Governor Tate Reeves. He plans to reach out to the governor’s staff soon.Copyright 2020 WLBT. All rights reserved.

None of these scenarios will, of course, be presented to the public by the WEF in January 2021. These are decisions taken behind closed doors by the key actors for the Beast. However, this grandiose plan of the Great Reset does not have to happen. There is at least half the world population and some of the most powerful countries, economically and militarily – like China and Russia – opposed to it. “Reset” maybe yes, but not in these western terms. In fact, a reset of kinds is already happening with China about to roll out a new People’s Bank of China backed blockchain-based cryptocurrency, the crypto RMB, or yuan. This is not only a hard currency based on a solid economy, it is also supported by gold.

 SEOUL, June 19 (Yonhap) -- No signs have been detected yet that suggest North Korea is following through with a threat to beef up military presence near the border with South Korea, a military official said Friday.\n On Wednesday, the General Staff of the North's Korean People's Army said it will redeploy troops to two joint inter-Korean economic zones, restore guard posts removed from the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) separating the two Koreas and resume all kinds of military exercises near the border in anger over anti- Pyongyang leaflet campaigns. \n "No actions directly related to the General Staff spokesperson's warnings have been confirmed," a JCS official told reporters. "Our military is maintaining a monitoring and readiness posture, keeping close tabs (on North Korea) round the clock." \n Earlier, North Korean soldiers were spotted at some empty guard posts inside the DMZ, sparking speculation the North could be moving to station more guard soldiers in border areas as was warn
