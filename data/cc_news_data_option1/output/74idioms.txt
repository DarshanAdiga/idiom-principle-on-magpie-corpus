SHREVEPORT, La. (KSLA) -"Breathtakingly beautiful....iconic," said Stephen Roberts. “It takes you to Broadway.”These are just some of the words that come to mind when Roberts describes the Strand Theatre. Sitting in the heart of downtown Shreveport is the state of Louisiana’s official theatre.The theatre was build in 1923 and for decades has brought musical masterpieces to its stage.Roberts is starting the new year as the board president, but he’s no stranger to this iconic Shreveport landmark.“I’ve always been a fan of the arts, and in the late 80′s I just became more active,” he said. “I wanted to contribute some money. I wanted to be involved. I wanted to make a difference for our community, and I sought out a seat on the board.”He’s coming in as the Strand Theatre enters a new year with no debt.“We were in debt over $275,000,” said Roberts. “We had several liens against us including one against us for the stagehands. That was I believe $75,000.”Along with that, the theatre also had maxed their line of credit totaling out to $100,000. Many of the board members had signed their own names as guarantors on the debt making them liable.It was during that time two years ago Jodie Glorioso stepped in to become the board’s president.“We were taking deep breaths, but I do believe there are certain angels above that are watching over us and so those angels sent people our way," she said.Those angels are in the community. The board soon created a matching fund (known by members as the “magic fund”) where the money raised by the community would be matched by individual and honorary board members.“We went to the community with letters and from the stage, we begged,” said Glorioso.The first year they wanted to raise $50,000. $25,000 would be from the community while the other half would be matched by board members. They ended up raising around $62,000.They did another magic fund campaign and in December they were surprised with a generous donation from a community member that helped them clear their debt and start the new year with nearly $100,000.Roberts says they plan to use that money on much-needed renovations. They will work to get the carpentry, and drapes fixed as well as purchase more hearing devices for the hearing impaired.“There’s $900,000 worth of things that need doing today a year from now they’ll be another $900,000,” he said.While Roberts and Glorioso have seen the theatre at it’s worse, they both always had high hopes for the theatre.“I never thought we would have to close the doors,” said Roberts. “We certainly discussed it... but I never we’d never really had to close the doors. She’s such a magnificent, iconic landmark for our state and Shreveport, Louisiana is so fortunate to have her.”With a new year, no debt, and money in the bank, Roberts hopes to bring more quality programs to the Strand Theatre, and work to reach a younger audience.“We need to diversify,” he said. “We need to reach the younger demographic so that the future will be sustainable.”On February 8th the Strand will be showcasing the musical “Finding Neverland.”You can read more about it and purchase tickets HERE.Copyright 2020 KSLA.

"By making it harder for people to discharge their debts and keep current on their house payments, the 2005 bill made the 2008 financial crisis significantly worse: experts found that the bill 'caused about 800,000 additional mortgage defaults and 250,000 additional foreclosures,'" Warren wrote in an online post. "And despite the claims from the industry and their allies in Congress that the 2005 bill would reduce credit card costs across the board for consumers, the cost of credit card debt went up too."

The PGA Awards has a stellar success rate at previewing the Best Picture line- up at the Oscars. When the academy expanded to 10 nominees in 2010, the Producers Guild of America followed suit. But while the Academy Awards shifted to a sliding scale in 2012, the PGA has stuck with 10 contenders (though it had 11 in 2018 due to a tie). That leeway has helped it maintain a staggering success rate at previewing the eventual Oscars roster.

The United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is having trouble locating Benjamin Reynolds, who is allegedly responsible for a cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme worth over $140 million. Financial news outlet FinanceFeeds reported on Jan. 6 that the CFTC has filed a motion with the New York Southern District Court. More precisely, the regulator filed for the service of process on Reynolds by publication on The Daily Telegraph and extending for sixty days the time limit by which the service must be effected on him and his firm. A major Bitcoin ponzi scheme In mid-June, the CFTC launched action against the company over an alleged $147 million Bitcoin (BTC) Ponzi. The CFTC filed against the Reynolds with the aforementioned court for allegedly defrauding over a thousand investors of at least 22,858 Bitcoin. In a memorandum accompanying the motion, the regulator reportedly explains that it attempted to serve Reynolds at the address listed as his "service address" in the incorporation papers of Control Finance, the firm that managed the scheme. When the process server arrived at the address, he discovered that it does not actually exist. The CFTC also tried to email Reynolds at the only known email address associated with him and his company, but got back an error message indicating that the message could not be delivered. The regulator learned from affected investors that the Ulsan District Prosecutors' Office in South Korea is also investigating the scheme, but had similarly failed to contact Reynolds. Cryptocurrency scams Scammers have long been using the speculative enthusiasm surrounding cryptocurrencies to lure in and defraud unsuspecting investors. As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin scam ads featuring the likeness of Martin Lewis have continued to appear on social media despite Lewis' previous efforts to prevent such illegal practices. One particularly famous cryptocurrency-related scam is OneCoin, which was a $4 billion pyramid scheme. The scam was first discovered in May 2015. However, proceedings are still ongoing, and OneCoin's website shut down only at the beginning of December last year.

COLUMBUS, Ga. (WTVM) - As flu season continues, Georgia ranks as the sickest state in the country according to health technology company Kinsa Health. This comes as many students are heading back to school from winter break this week.Doctors say one of the flu’s challenges is that you could be carrying it a day before you are actually sick.“Even healthy folks who think they’re healthy may actually be carriers and are spreading it, so that makes it even more difficult for the kiddos because your kids might go to school. They’re great and they may actually be transmitting or getting the flu from somebody,” said. Dr. Karla Owen who is a family physician with Piedmont.Dr. Owen says she has seen flu cases pick up over the last few weeks. Similar to last year, this is considered a high flu season.“The strain of the flu is what makes it worse than other seasons. Depending on the strain, it can make it for a milder flu season or for a more intense one," Dr. Owen explained.Pamela Kirkland with the Columbus Health Department says even though we are in the middle of flu season, it is not too late to get a flu shot.“This year it’s particularly helpful since the strain that we’re seeing is one of the strains in the vaccine, so the CDC always recommends everyone from six months of age older to get a flu shot," Kirkland said.To avoid the flu, Doctor Owen says to wash your hands, sneeze and cough into a tissue and don’t touch your face with your hands.“Routine cleaning of all hard services whether that’s your phone, your kitchen area, your child’s desk. Anything your child goes to school with and comes back with, clean everything," Dr. Owen said.She says the main way the flu is spread is through respiratory particles. Dr. Owen says someone sick with the flu who is coughing or sneezing can spread the germs within a six-foot radius.If you are not sure if you have the common cold or the flu, Dr. Owen says the flu has an abrupt onset and higher fever. The flu is something eight-year-old Abi Nichols hopes she never has again.“I do wash my hands more often now and I eat healthier and I drink healthier because I don’t want to get the flu again," Nichols said.According to the Georgia Department of Public Health, there have been 15 flu-associated deaths since the end of September.They also say anyone within a six-foot radius of someone coughing or sneezing with the flu is likely to get the flu.Copyright 2020 WTVM.
