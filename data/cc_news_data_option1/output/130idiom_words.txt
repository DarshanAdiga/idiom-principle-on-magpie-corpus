For Derek West, 28, of Santa Rosa, shredding paper is all about speed.


  His job as a sorter for Becoming Independent’s document shredding service requires him to spend hours every day sifting through troves of documents for any non-recyclable items accidentally mixed in. West, who is autistic, takes pride sorting through as much paper as he can without sacrificing the quality of his work.


  “I can sort them quickly like this,” West said as he gave a brief demonstration, rapidly sliding his palms over one another. “That’s my speed technique.”


  The Santa Rosa-based nonprofit held a four-hour “Shred-a-Thon” Friday to celebrate its contract with the County of Sonoma, offering for free its most popular social enterprise program, an initiative that allows adults with disabilities to earn a hard day’s work.


  The Secured Document Shredding service has been a marquee offering since it launched in 1999. Becoming Independent shredded an average of 78 tons of paper per year at its main office, and last year took a step forward with a grant- funded purchase of a custom mobile truck, increasing both its efficiency and reach.


  “In our first July we did almost 10 times what we do in an average month,” said Luana Vaetoe, chief executive of the nonprofit.
