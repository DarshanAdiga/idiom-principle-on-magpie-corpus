Heb je al eens geprobeerd het aangekoekte vet en de verbrande resten met een propje aluminium en zeep van je barbecuerooster te verwijderen? Inderdaad, het geeft veel troep en je bent er lang mee bezig voordat je echt resultaat hebt. Dat kan beter.      Luister maar naar onder anderen Koos van Essen, barbecue-chef, die bijna dagelijks staat te koken boven een rooster met kolen. Tussen het snijden van de groente en het vlees door legt hij uit dat het belangrijk is om de barbecue goed schoon te maken. ,,Je wilt op je vlees natuurlijk wel mooie strepen hebben, maar die moeten van de grill komen en niet van het roet.’’      Bovendien kan er schimmel aan de binnenkant van je rooster komen en daar zit je niet op te wachten als je van plan bent om er vlees en groente op te leggen. ,,Zeker als je de barbecue voor het eerst naar buiten haalt, moet je even de tijd nemen om hem schoon te maken.’’

"articleBody" : "The Interior Ministry has lifted another transport restriction initially imposed to slow the spread of the coronavirus by removing the obligation that 50 percent of seats in public transportation vehicles should be empty. The decision to remove the curb was taken in line with recommendations made by the Science Board, which advises the government on measures to be implemented against the outbreak. Initially, public transport vehicles, including buses, shared taxis (dolmuş) and shuttle buses, which carry company employees, were required to operate at 50 percent seat capacity. The ministry has issued a directive to the governor’s offices in the country’s 81 provinces and said that this regulation is now lifted. However, those public transport vehicles are still not allowed to accept standing passengers, while travelers will not be seated facing each other. According to the ministry’s directive, the local sanitation boards in towns and provinces will have the authority to rule on whether standing passengers will be allowed on metros, metrobuses and trams. Turkey this week moved into the normalization phase, removing a wide range of restrictions during the height of the outbreak. Restaurants, cafes, museums, beaches, gyms and parks reopened on June 1 under the government’s normalization roadmap. Inter-city travel restrictions were also lifted.",

History was made of sorts, but not in a good way, when the Boston Athletic Association (BAA) announced last week that the 2020 running of the Boston Marathon will not take place, because of the coronavirus scare.      The Patriots' Day tradition was originally postponed until Sept. 14, but the governing body was forced to cancel it altogether for the first time in the 124-year history of the venerable event in light of the ongoing pandemic.      The news did not really surprise the running community. But then again, how could this happen, and where do we go from here?      While it was still incredibly disappointing to everyone involved, the prospect of more than 31,000 runners from every corner of the world descending upon the small town of Hopkinton, Massachusetts, in the midst of a pandemic - that is likely to spike again in the fall - made the decision to cancel the only correct decision.      The implications of this decision are profound. The running of the marathon on Patriots' Day has always been an opportunity for the City of Boston to showcase its many cultural and historical gems, while also injecting more than $200 million into the local economy.      Many run for charities, with more than $38 million raised last year for worthy causes alone. And then, there is the legendary history from the previous 123 years.      It all started in 1897, and was inspired by the first Olympic Marathon held in Athens, Greece. Throughout the next 122 years, it became the oldest continuous marathon. The format, ironically, was changed in 1918, when the Spanish Flu affected the world, not to mention it was also the beginning of WWI. The traditional race was replaced with a military relay in honor of our troops.      Last week's unprecedented decision by the BAA also included that the race will be held virtually. Each participant is invited to run the marathon distance on or after Sept. 14. Registration fees will be refunded, and the prized marathon medals will be mailed to the finishers. Additionally, the BAA will be announcing a full-week of events celebrating the marathon's uniqueness.      Because 2021 was scheduled to be a significant milestone in the race's 125-year history, the decision to find some way to hold the 124th was critical. But for those that were expecting to run the 124th in the traditional format, the disappointment is still profound.      There is a small, but exclusive group of runners who are members of the QCC, the Quarter Century Club. To become a member, you must officially complete 25 consecutive Boston Marathons. I am now a retired member with 35 consecutive finishes, so I can attest that these folks are struggling with the implications of now having to run the race solo to keep the streak alive.      Not everybody, of course. In fact, each year more than 50% of the runners are first-timers.      I have many close friends, who would be experiencing the thrill of running Boston for the first time this year. Take, for example, Amanda. When she learned that she would be given the opportunity to run the 124th, she literally fell to her knees in tears of joy. "This has been a dream, and now it will be a reality," she said.      However, she won't be experiencing those anxious hours driving to Hopkinton on the bus with her running counterparts, the excitement of being called to line up in Hopkinton's start corral and her heart racing at the sound of the starter's gun. She will also not experience the unbridled joy of running through the "scream tunnel" of the Wellesley College coeds, and then proudly conquering the Newton Hills, so well known as "Heartbreak Hill." And, of course, she will not feel the overwhelming emotions when runners turn the corner onto Hereford Street and see the finish line just a quarter-mile away.      This pandemic has changed many aspects of our lives, and likely many will be permanent changes. What will the future hold for the Boston Marathon? What will the future hold for the many other huge running events throughout the world? Will there be a time when 30, 40, 50,000 or more runners can gather at a starting line again?      In the meantime, runners will adapt as the running industry adapts.   Not only has the Boston Marathon been forced to deal with these new crowd restrictions, but every race - from local to international - that is scheduled to be run in 2020 is either cancelling, postponing or going virtual.   In fact, a plethora of new virtual running events has emerged, with goals ranging from simply running a 5K to virtually running the distance of the New York subway system, and runners love it. Social media posts show off the earned swag, most notably the medals. Give a runner a goal and the promise of a medal to commemorate the effort, and you have an event.      Guessing where we will be a year from now or beyond is an exercise in futility, but in my humble opinion the running world will be different. I hope traditional running events will be back, but will there be a drop in the enthusiasm?      I suspect we will have the Boston Marathon back in its traditional format. It is, of course, the most prestigious race for a runner. But I think many races will be hybrids. Runners will be given a choice of running virtually or onsite. But one thing is certain, race directors may have to reinvent their industry. It's a good thing that we have guys like Dave McGillivray, the Boston Marathon race director, who are figuring it out right now.      In the meantime, let's get out there for a run together alone.   Tom Licciardello is a founding member of the Merrimack Valley Striders. Licciardello has participated in 35 Boston's and 88 marathons altogether, and is a BAA Boston Marathon volunteer. He can be reached at tomlicc@gmail.com.

Akron police are investigating after a theft at a business inside Chapel Hill Mall, and Summit Mall closed as a precaution.
   
 Akron Police Lt. Michael Miller said Monday afternoon officers were sent to Chapel Hill Mall when suspects smashed a display counter.
   
 He said the mall was open at the time, and jewelry was stolen from Gold N Diamonds. Miller said there are multiple suspects.
   
 Speaking to Akron City Council Monday night, Police Chief Kenneth Ball released more details.
   
 "Approximately 10 suspects were involved. They rushed the store, smashed out some counter tops and stole some jewelry," he said. "At first there was a concern that it might have been related to these most recent incidents, but it wasn't."
   
 Miller said the officers are not investigating it as looting, but as a grand theft.
   
 Rumors were circulating on social media Monday afternoon about the mall being looted.
   
 Police in Fairlawn, where Summit Mall is located, were notified about the Chapel Hill situation, Miller said -- noting that such a communication normally would occur for these kinds of thefts.
   
 Summit Mall closed at about 3 p.m. following the notification, a Fairlawn dispatcher said. It closed as a precaution, and no incidents were reported at the mall.
   
 Chapel Hill Mall said on it's website that it's closed until further notice.
   
 Across the country, retailers and shopping centers remain on edge as protests continue in the wake of the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer pinned him to the ground during an arrest. Reports of looting and rioting have caused some shop owners to close early or not open at all in various cities.

NBA Rumors: Victor Oladipo Could Be Heat's Plan B If They Fail To Sign Giannis Antetokounmpo In 2021 Offseason


--DocBreak--
CANTON Police arrested a wanted Columbus man and seized a loaded gun after a woman called them five times Monday night to report he'd threatened to kill her.
   
 According to Stark County Jail records, the 31-year-old woman told police shortly after 11 p.m. that the man had damaged her home, and that he was likely hiding near her house, which is on 16th Street NW. She also told them that he was watching them search the area.
   
 When the officers found Marquis D. Ball, 30, hiding in bushes near the house, he ran away.
   
 Police quickly found and arrested him at 11:15 p.m. Monday at Auburn Place NW and Shorb Avenue.
   
 They also seized a loaded handgun he had in his possession, according to jail records.
   
 Ball was wanted on felony warrants charging him with menacing by stalking, robbery and intimidation of a crime victim or witness.
   
 He also was charged with aggravated menacing, felony menacing by stalking and having weapons under disability.
   
 Ball is on parole, having been released from state prison March 18 after serving time for two counts of drug trafficking and possession in Licking County.
   
 He also went to prison in 2012 for two counts of burglary, in 2013 for cocaine trafficking and in 2017 for cocaine possession, aggravated drug possession and two counts of heroin trafficking, according to Licking County court records.
   
 A warrant was issued for his arrest on a robbery charge April 27 after the same woman who called police Monday night accused Ball of assaulting her and taking her keys. Warrants charging Ball with felony menacing and intimidation were issued May 18 after she reportedly told police that he assaulted her again and smashed out her window because she had reported the previous assault to police.
   
 He remained behind bars Tuesday, held in lieu of $127,000 bond pending a Canton Municipal Court hearing.

The Interior Ministry has lifted another transport restriction initially imposed to slow the spread of the coronavirus by removing the obligation that 50 percent of seats in public transportation vehicles should be empty.      The decision to remove the curb was taken in line with recommendations made by the Science Board, which advises the government on measures to be implemented against the outbreak.      Initially, public transport vehicles, including buses, shared taxis (dolmuş) and shuttle buses, which carry company employees, were required to operate at 50 percent seat capacity.      The ministry has issued a directive to the governor’s offices in the country’s 81 provinces and said that this regulation is now lifted.      However, those public transport vehicles are still not allowed to accept standing passengers, while travelers will not be seated facing each other.      According to the ministry’s directive, the local sanitation boards in towns and provinces will have the authority to rule on whether standing passengers will be allowed on metros, metrobuses and trams.      Turkey this week moved into the normalization phase, removing a wide range of restrictions during the height of the outbreak.      Restaurants, cafes, museums, beaches, gyms and parks reopened on June 1 under the government’s normalization roadmap. Inter-city travel restrictions were also lifted.

hooks describes the struggle for Black liberation as a struggle for voice. It is a struggle to be heard. It is a struggle to be recognized as having spoken, as having something of value to say. It is a struggle against the structures and practices which have demonstrated a desire to silence and appropriate Black narratives for the white gaze. Postmodern Black liberation, particularly for the Black _woman_ , is a struggle for self-ownership: To believe that our voices belong to ourselves and to convince the world that we are not up for grabs.

As you know, I am currently seeking the nomination of the Libertarian Party for President of the United States.  Yes, I know, no third-party candidate has any chance to win the presidency.  But, actually, we do.  First of all, there is no question that we will not have the tens of millions of dollars and the media attention to compete in large states like California and New York, which will go to Vice President Biden (or whomever the Democrats nominate), or in Texas, which will go to President Trump.  Instead, we will spend our resources, time and energy in five small and independent states, as yet to be determined.  Then we will engage the local media and speak directly with the voters, looking them in the eye and telling them that their votes will make history.  Imagine if we win two or three small states - which could be done by receiving 38 to 40 percent of the vote!  In addition, it would almost certainly become newsworthy for the entire country if the Libertarian candidates were beginning to poll stronger in these smaller states.  So the national media would begin to explain why that was happening, which gain attention and would also likely result in increased votes for the libertarian down-ballot candidates in other states as well. __ __

While an exact reopening date for Massachusetts restaurants remains up in air, with June 8 being the earliest possible date, new guidelines issued Friday have enabled restaurants to start planning to resume in-person dining.
 Restaurants, included in Phase 2 of Gov. Charlie Baker's four-phase plan that was announced May 18, have been closed to the public since Baker banned on- premises consumption at restaurants and bars statewide on March 15.
 Deag's Diner in Stoughton reopened takeout and delivery operations May 20 after temporarily closing on April 5 due to safety concerns for staff. While closed, owner Joseph Deagle had a new takeout window installed for customers to pick up orders, and while business has been slow, he's seeing his regular customers return, he said. He's been eager to reopen indoor dining due to not having an outdoor dining area, but with the new guidelines in place, he's planning to contact town officials to see if he can set up tables in the parking lot.
 "If I could have a few tables inside right away, it would actually really help," he said. "With them pushing it back a few more weeks, it's going to be tough."
 But in the meantime, Deagle has been moving forward with plans to install a divider between the open kitchen and dining room as well as using a table layout to space out customers while allowing for proper disinfection, though he expects a slow reopening.
 "Everyone keeps saying 'the new normal,' " he said. "I understand things are going to change, but I hope it's not a new normal. I hope we can get past this, find a sustainable level of business and get back to where everybody's restaurants are full again."
 While many have turned to takeout and delivery to stay open, the practice isn't sustainable for the long haul, said David Laghetto, owner of Barrels and Boards restaurant in Raynham.
 "What we're doing for takeout in a week is what we did on a Thursday night," Laghetto said. "The restaurant industry is getting hit hard. The whole service industry is probably hit the hardest out of all of them."
 On Friday, Baker and Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito announced that officials will review public health trends and announce whether Phase 2 will start June 8 or at a later date on June 6. But according to the new guidelines, restaurants will initially be limited to only outdoor dining, with indoor dining to be allowed later on in Phase 2. Tables will need to be 6 feet apart, unless separated by protective and non-porous barriers, and parties are limited to six people per table, among other operational and hygiene guidelines.
 At Maguire's Bar and Grill in Easton, owner Neil Levine said they will able to utilize outdoor seating, but will be limited to about a handful of tables to start.
 "With 6 feet separation, we'll probably max out at 50 percent capacity until they lift the social distancing rule, but we're in for the long haul," he said. "This will be a tremendous financial burden for us."
 But once state officials give the word, for which he anticipates a June 8 reopening day, Levine said Maguire's will be ready. He's been proactive in establishing safety measures, for which he said they already "exceed" state guidelines, such as virtual menus accessible by smartphone, one-way entry and exits, regularly treated HVAC systems with antimicrobial air filters and personal protective equipment for staff like masks and gloves, as well as no- touch thermometers to measure customers' temperatures if needed.
 "Just tell us when and we can do it and we'll do it safely and with the best interest of the public," Levine said. "We're literally fighting for our lives every day through this."
 Laghetto also noted he's working on outdoor seating, though he'll also be limited to a few tables due to the social distancing guidelines. But he's hopeful for a June 8 reopening, pointing to restaurants in neighboring states such as Rhode Island that have seen a good stream of customers since reopening.
 "Eventually, we will get back to normality somehow," he said. "It might be six months, it might be two months, it might be a year, I don't know, but eventually we'll get back."

English Premier League players will be able to show solidarity with the George Floyd justice campaign during games without the prospect of facing sanctions. The Football Association on Tuesday endorsed FIFA's new stance that “common sense” would be applied when assessing the context of on- field messages on players' equipment. The laws of the game prohibit “any political, religious or personal slogans, statements or images.\" German soccer authorities said they may sanction players who used goal celebrations to highlight last week's death in Minneapolis of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleaded for air. But the English FA, which oversees disciplinary action for Premier League games, has given the green light for players using games to protest against social and racial inequality. “Where any behaviors or gestures on the pitch that may constitute a breach of the laws of the game have to be assessed, they would be reviewed on a case by case basis with a common sense approach and understanding of their context,” the FA said in a statement when asked about players' tributes to Floyd. \"The power of football can break down barriers across communities and we remain deeply committed to removing all forms of discrimination from across the game we all love.” The Premier League is due to resume on June 17. Players from Chelsea, Liverpool and Newcastle have been pictured this week in training taking a knee as part of anti-racism gestures sparked by the death of Floyd.

Before Roger Federer briefly returned to clay-court tennis in 2019 — a decade removed from his French Open title — his confidence was low, he explained, “because I don’t even remember how to slide anymore.” Before Maria Sharapova figured out the necessary footwork to claim two trophies in Paris, she joked the rust-colored surface made her look like “a cow on ice.” And anyone who’s ever seen Rafael Nadal play on clay knows his ability to glide along the ground to reach shots others can’t is as big a reason for his record 12 championships at Roland Garros as his bullwhip of a forehand or his unflagging spirit. One of the common sights at the French Open, postponed from now until September because of the coronavirus pandemic, are the marks left in the clay by sliding players. A big secret to success on the surface is the skill of the slide, which involves getting into position to hit a ball and quickly changing directions for the next shot. “Clay-court tennis requires a blend of aggression with patience and tactics and physicality. If you’re a natural mover, as Nadal is on this surface, that’s not something that has to come into your focus. If you’re not ... it’s so different from what you’re used to playing on predominantly, a hard court, where your footing is secure,” said Jim Courier, a four-time major champion. “Clay requires a bit of a different mindset. You have to be ready to hit that extra shot. You have to be ready to slide, dig in, play some defense.” In the nearly 30 years since Courier’s titles at Roland Garros in 1991-92, only one other French Open was won by an American man, Andre Agassi in 1999. More often it is someone from Europe — usually Nadal, of course — or South America, such as Gustavo Kuerten. “I was...
