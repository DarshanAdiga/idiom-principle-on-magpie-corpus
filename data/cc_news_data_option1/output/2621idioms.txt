How could this happen? If fat is bad, if it makes you fat and fat causes disease, then eliminating it should have resulted in a healthier society. Which, clearly it did not.
 There really are only two answers; a) People ignored the government’s advice and guidelines and continued eating fats
 or b) They did listen and it was bad advice based on bad science. Given the number of “fat free,” “low fat” and “no fat” products that exploded in the 1980s and continued for decades, it's clear now that the advice was wrong.
 In addition, governments recommended increasing carbohydrate consumption to the tune of about eight servings per day of breads, cereals, pastas and grains — all foods we know cause cause blood sugar to spike and the body to store fat. Not to mention a whole host of digestive issues.
 This advice was not only wrong, but damaging to the health of entire populations. And yet our own Canada Food guide is still recommending this level of carbohydrate intake as healthy. Food for thought, no?
 Now we all know that fat tastes good and removing it from food also removes the taste. To restore taste, food companies began adding, you guessed it, sugar. Yet another processed carbohydrate thrown into the mix adding fuel to what has become an explosive health crisis.

At Classic Park, Indians fans shared their perspectives.
 Painesville resident Allan Kowalczyk, Paul Catalano and Dave Horvath — both of Concord Township — echoed one another in stating they'd likely never attend another game if the franchise decides to change its name.
 "I find it difficult now to go down to an Indians game and spend $250," Horvath said. "No, I’m not going to go. I’ll watch them from home, definitely, but I’m not going to pony up 250 bucks to go see an Indians game."
 Concord resident Courtney Sheehy, a police officer, is a lifelong Indians fan. She recalls fond memories of attending World Series games with her family when she grew up in the 1990s.
 Sheehy would be on board with whatever the organization decides.
 "I think the Indians really just need to do what is best for the franchise," Sheehy said. "We’re going to support the team no matter what. I think as a Cleveland fan, you’ve got support all the teams — the Browns, the Cavs, the Indians — no matter what choices the franchise decides to do. I’m going to support the Indians no matter what."
 Baerga recognizes change can be difficult and could generate division within the team's fanbase.
 "It’s kind of hard," Baerga said. "I came to the big leagues as an Indian. I’ve been working for the Indians a long time. It’s hard for the fans, too, because there’s been a lot of changes the last few years. Before, it was the chief on the hat, now it’s going to be the name. I think it’s going to be something really, really big to happen but we’re going through a lot of things all over the world."

Long before the pandemic, U.S. workers’ productivity and their median pay, which once rose in tandem, went through an acrimonious divorce. Compensation, especially in some of the country’s fastest-growing industries, has stagnated, while the cost of housing, health care and education have not. The federal minimum wage, stuck at $7.25 since 2009, is worth 70% of what it was in 1968, and about one-third of what it would be had it kept pace with productivity. Benefits have been slashed and employee rights (and unions) deeply diminished. The pandemic has exacerbated the problem, but also placed it in stark relief. This is how the American worker got fleeced. —Josh Petri

In a presidential message Saturday on the 244th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, Trump acknowledged that “over the past months, the American spirit has undoubtedly been tested by many challenges.”
 His Democratic rival, Joe Biden, said in a statement that the U.S. “never lived up” to its founding principle that “all men are created equal," but that today "we have a chance to rip the roots of systemic racism out of this country.''
 His participation in big gatherings comes as many communities have decided to scrap fireworks, parades and other holiday traditions. The goal is to try to prevent further spread of the coronavirus, which large gatherings could spur. Confirmed cases are climbing in 40 states, and the U.S. set another record Friday with 52,300 newly reported infections, according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins University.
 For the Mount Rushmore event, GOP Gov. Kristi Noem, a Trump ally, insisted social distancing wasn’t necessary and masks were optional. Trump spent little time in his Mount Rushmore address reflecting on pandemic, which has killed more than 129,000 Americans.
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cautions that mass gatherings like the one scheduled for Washington present a high risk for spread of the virus.
 Trump’s surgeon general, Jerome Adams, who has stepped up his call for Americans to wear a mask in public, sidestepped when asked during an interview Friday whether he would caution a loved one from attending such large gatherings. “It’s not a yes or no,” Adams told NBC’s “Today Show.” “Every single person has to make up their own mind."
 Trump has been aching to see the nation return to normalcy, and has been willing to push the envelope further than many states and big city mayors are willing to go.

Win, Lose, or Draught bar in Springfield will be closed through July 15 after two employees who worked last week tested positive for COVID-19.
   
 In a series of social media posts, owner Ryan Bandy confirmed the results.
   
 Bandy said one employee was in the bar as a customer for about 30 minutes Saturday and worked Sunday and Monday.
   
 The employee was and continues to be asymptomatic. He was also wearing a mask while working, Bandy said.
   
 In another post a couple hours later, Bandy confirmed that a second employee, who worked Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday last week, also tested positive.
   
 After that, he made the decision to temporarily close the bar, 7004 Kingsmill Court.
   
 "Even though the employees wore masks, I would rather err on the side of caution," Bandy wrote.
   
 Bandy said the first employee was not in contact with other customers Saturday and interacted with approximately 20 on Sunday and 10 on Monday.
   
 But, he said he was hopeful that the safety measures in place at the bar prevented anyone else from contracting it there.
   
 This is the second instance in recent weeks of a Springfield bar having to close after an employee tested positive for COVID-19.
   
 Crows Mill Pub owner Scott Weitekamp closed last Sunday after learning that morning that a bartender who worked the beer garden the previous week had tested positive.
   
 Meanwhile, the Illinois Department of Public Health reported 868 new positive cases across the state, including 18 additional deaths.
   
 This brings the state's total up to 145,750 positive cases, including 7,005 deaths. And with Scott County reporting its first case today, there have now been cases in all 102 counties.
   
 The state's preliminary seven-day positivity rate is 2.6%, among the lowest in the Midwest.
   
 But as cases spike across the country, Gov. JB Pritzker and state public health officials urged residents and businesses ahead of the holiday weekend to comply with public health measures.
   
 "The virus is not taking the holiday weekend off, and neither can we. Letting our guard down now would fly in the face of the progress we've made over many months," Pritzker said in a statement. "We have seen that mitigation measures have worked in our state and we've seen too many other states rapidly lose ground in the fight against the virus."
   
 Public health officials encouraged residents to use caution if out this weekend.
   
 "Over the holiday weekend, we strongly urge people to be socially responsible and avoid crowded bars and restaurants," said Illinois Department of Public Health director Ngozi Ezike. If you do go to one of these venues, please make sure to keep distance between yourself and others and wear a face covering."
   
 Meanwhile, Sangamon County public health officials reported eight new positive cases, bringing the county's total to 445, including 34 deaths.
   
 The new cases involved a teenage male, two women in their 20s, a man in his 20s, a woman in her 40s and two men in their 60s.
   
 A man in his 50s who works at Cedarhurst of Springfield also tested positive, said county spokesman Jeff Wilhite.
   
 Five residents, including a women in her 70s who died earlier this week, and three employees of the senior care facility have tested positive.
   
 Two county residents remain hospitalized, 68 are currently isolated and 341 have recovered.
   
 Public health officials in Cass County confirmed that a 97-year-old man who was a resident at Walker's Nursing Home passed away from the disease. He's the seventh COVID-19-related death in the county.
   
 The total number of cases in the county remains 135, with 93 recovered and one currently hospitalized.
   
 Logan County officials confirmed two additional cases, bringing the county's total to 19, including 12 who have recovered.
   
 The new cases involves a man in his 20s who is asymptomatic and a man in his 50s who is hospitalized in Springfield.
   
 No additional positive cases were reported in Morgan County, keeping the county's total at 134, including three deaths.
