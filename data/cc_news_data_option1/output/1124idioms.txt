And now that I have added to the angst level of any liberals who might be reading this missive, let me bring back the fairness doctrine and snag the conservative attention for a bit by addressing the other great unknown looming just ahead—the economic impact of all this.
 And in this area, there is a bit more certainty. In a word, it is going to be brutal.
 Just for starters, every professional and amateur sporting event in the country has been, if not canceled outright, then suspended until further notice. There is no basketball. There is no baseball. There is no hockey. There is no spring football. Lots of players, lots of coaches, lot of stadium attendants and food vendors and moguls and go’fers. Job security—How would you like to be an an executive at the SEC Network or ESPN right now?
 Concerts? Nope. Cultural events? No way. Movie theaters? One cough and there would be a stampede.
 Republicans of a certain ilk and fundamental preachers are probably the most smugly satisfied folks in the country right now because anything that in any way qualifies as fun is pretty much ruled out for the immediate future.
 And since everybody is being told to batten down the hatches of their homes with themselves inside, I am pretty sure the travel and leisure industries are gonna take a pretty painful hit.
 An old song allows as how “trains and boats and planes are passing by,” but right now, you can be relatively sure that they are all empty. And that has the politicians’ attention. We can’t even figure out how many people have the damn virus because for reasons I cannot fathom the richest nation on Earth doesn’t have enough test kits, but the powers that be are already talking about financial bailouts for the airlines and cruise ship and — wait for it — hotel industries.
 The better to spruce up some of those fraying deck chairs at Mar Lago, of course.
 I wish I had better news, folks, but the fact is I’m thinking we’ve all got ourselves a pretty tough row to hoe. But I do have a suggestion: Seems to me we might all do better to stay calm, keep our heads, and perhaps think a little less about padding our own toilet paper stashes and more about how we might help out our neighbors.
 You know, do the things good people do — as old-fashioned and out-of-style as that may be.

“It should not be a significant issue because while the coronavirus can linger on inanimate objects and surfaces that are frequently touched, it lingers the longest on non-porous surfaces,” she said. “Money is porous, so it would dry out.”
 Gaffney-Adams said the virus would only last a few hours, at the most, on cash and coins. Therefore, she said it shouldn’t be a significant concern if someone would need to withdraw cash out of an ATM because that cash can sit for days in the ATM, long enough for the virus to expire.
 Regarding getting cash back at a store, she said the greater concern there would be with human to human contact.
 “Above and beyond the money, you’ve also touched the items on the shelf, maybe you’ve touched the keypad, maybe you touched the handle of the shopping cart, the door to get in and out of the place,” Gaffney-Adams said. “To minimize the issue to just the contact of dollars exchanged is really minimizing the severity of the situation. We have to think about all the surfaces we touch.”
 She said it’s impossible to not touch any surfaces, “you can’t avoid everything”, that’s why practicing good hand hygiene is of the utmost importance.
 “To limit our concern to the exchange of cash dollars or coins has us not focused on the bigger issue at hand,” Gaffney-Adams said.
 Meanwhile, according to the Asia news outlet CNA, South Korea's central bank announced two weeks ago that it would be quarantining “banknotes” for two weeks, “to remove any traces of coronavirus”. They also reported they were “even burning some as part of efforts to stem the outbreak”.
