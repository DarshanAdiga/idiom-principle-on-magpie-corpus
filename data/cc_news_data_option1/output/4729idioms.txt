At this point, it's clear that it matters not whom the Bears face. Their offense is broken, seemingly beyond repair. Those October explanations that the running game was stalled because of the strong fronts the Bears faced against the Indianapolis Colts and Tampa Bay Buccaneers no longer hold water.
 The Bears faced a weak Carolina Panthers run defense in Week 6 and churned out only 63 yards on 25 rushes.

Take a minute to appreciate Kyle Fuller's touchdown-saving pass deflection against Adam Thielen in the third quarter, helping the defense get off the field quickly after Dwayne Harris' muffed punt gave the Vikings possession in the red zone. The Bears defense stiffened there and allowed only a field goal in part because of Fuller's masterful play.

Head coach Thomas Dennerby could continue, but the journey of several of his Indian players has ended even before they could hit the road to fame, courtesy the cancellation of next year's FIFA Women's U-17 World Cup. Having worked so hard and for so long, they are now unsure about their future for no fault of theirs. As consolation, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Wednesday assured them that they would be considered for selection to the senior team in the near future. "I believe that some players, who are 2005 born in this team, may qualify to play in the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup in 2022.

If you look at the weekly charts, the trends of the major indexes and most stocks are pointed up—i.e., this is still a bull market, and the trends and other factors (such as the unusual strength seen two weeks ago) portend higher prices down the road. That said, there’s no question the environment remains extremely news-driven (mostly with vaccine news, but also economic reports and government policy outlooks), with plenty of crosscurrents depending on the day. Encouragingly, today’s vaccine news didn’t dent the growth leaders like it did a week ago, which is a step in the right direction. Net-net, we remain optimistic, but the details remain vital; getting decent entry points and position sizing correctly (not too big so you can handle the swings) is key, as is focusing on stocks (cyclical or growth) that have shown good-volume support of late.

USD/CAD is pushing higher above 1.3100 on Thursday. WTI trades in the negative territory near $41. US Dollar Index rebounds above 92.50 as sentiment sours. After dropping to a weekly low of 1.3032 on Wednesday, the USD/CAD pair turned north on Thursday as falling crude oil prices make it difficult for the commodity-sensitive loonie to find demand. As of writing, the pair was up 0.25% on a daily basis at 1.3114. WTI fails to hold above $42 Heightened optimism for a steady recovery in global energy demand amid positive coronavirus vaccine developments and hopes for additional oil output cuts provided a boost to crude oil prices during the first half of the week. However, the barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), which climbed to $42.50 area on Wednesday, seems to have gone into a consolidation phase and was last seen losing nearly 1% on the day at $41.15. Meanwhile, the souring market mood, as reflected by sharp declines witnessed in major European equity indexes, is helping the greenback gather strength against its rivals. At the moment, the US Dollar Index is up nearly 0.4% on the day at 92.66. Later in the day, the US Department of Labor's weekly Initial Jobless Claims data and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's Manufacturing Survey will be looked upon for fresh impetus. On the other hand, ADP Employment Change will be featured in the Canadian economic docket. Investors will keep a close eye on Wall Street as well. The S&P 500 Futures are currently down 0.3% on the day and the USD could preserve its bullish momentum in the second half of the day if US stocks suffer heavy losses.

Head coach Thomas Dennerby could continue, but the journey of several of his Indian players has ended even before they could hit the road to fame, courtesy the cancellation of next year s FIFA Women s U 17 World Cup. Having worked so hard and for so long, they are now unsure about their future for no fault of theirs. As consolation, the All India Football Federation AIFF on Wednesday assured them that they would be considered for selection to the senior team in the near future. I believe that some players, who are 2005 born in this team, may qualify to play in the FIFA U 17 Women s World Cup in 2022. FIFA has not yet given age cut offs but we believe it will be 2005 2007 born, AIFF general secretary Kushal Das told PTI. All these players are part of overall plan to develop women s football. They will continue to be part of national camp. This team will be the core team to play in round one of AFC U 20 Women s Asian Cup qualifiers in March 2021 in view of their training and exposure so far. He said many of these players who will miss out on the 2022 Women s U 17 World Cup will make it to the senior national team for the AFC Asian Women s Cup in 2022, which the country is hosting. The tournament in India, which was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID 19 pandemic, was on Tuesday cancelled by the world governing body FIFA and the country was handed the hosting rights of the 2022 edition. More than half of the players who were called for national camp last year to prepare for the now scrapped 2020 edition of the tournament will be over the age of 19 by 2022. The AIFF intends to form an Indian Arrows women s team like the men s side that has been taking part in the I League to play in the Hero Indian Women s League. Das indicated that head coach Dennerby will be in charge of the Indian team in the 2022 edition following a contract extension. We believe Thomas is the right coach for the U 17 World Cup team. He has now gained experience of India and has a good track record and a very good rapport with the support staff. We will certainly be discussing with the AIFF Technical Committee to extend his contract, he said. Asked if those countries which have qualified for the 2020 tournament like Japan, Spain, England and Germany will remain for the 2022 edition, he said, While no clarity as yet but it seems logical that since the FIFA U 17 Women s World Cup 2020 is cancelled and there is likely to be a new age group, the qualifiers will be played again. He said there will be no financial loss on the part of the AIFF due to cancellation and the national federation will discuss with FIFA about continuing with the existing Local Organising Committee till 2022. Das said the FIFA had taken the best decision to cancel the 2020 tournament as we are not still not certain about 2021 as far as the pandemic is concerned. There is no point scheduling a world cup in an uncertain situation and playing in a stadium without spectators. Hopefully, a vaccine will be developed and be available by mid 2021 and life will be back to normal thereafter. He said hosting both the FIFA Women s U 17 World Cup and the AFC Women s Asian Cup in 2022 will give a great fillip to women s football in India and help in preparing teams for qualification for the Women s Asian Cup 2026 and the FIFA Women s World Cup in 2027.

The pound has been one of the worst-performing G10 currencies overnight amidst a broad-based rebound for the US dollar off recent lows. Brexit talks have yet to yield a breakthrough and a failure is set to down sterling by 5% to 10%, according to Lee Hardman, Currency Analyst at MUFG Bank. Key quotes "Pound weakness has been driven in part by reports that some EU countries are insisting that 'no deal' is better than a bad deal. According to Politico, senior EU officials and diplomats say that several countries including France, the Netherlands and Spain are worried that the EU's mission- focused chief negotiator Michel Barnier may be too eager to conclude a deal with the UK and that EU heads of state and government will have to step in to stop an agreement that is worse for the EU than a no-deal scenario. Overall though EU officials would much prefer to reach a trade agreement." "A head-to- head meeting between chief Brexit negotiators Michel Barnier and David Frost today has been described as a 'moment of truth' by one EU official. If there is thought to have been sufficient progress, the UK team could remain in Brussels over the weekend. Observers still expect a deal early next week or in the first week of December. Market participants are similarly not that concerned over the risk of no-deal Brexit at this point in time." "There is likely to be a much larger pound move to the downside if both sides fail to reach a deal (-5% to -10%), while we expect a modest move to the upside for the pound if a deal is finalized (+1% to +4%)."

Their choice of arc – British-Iranian relations, Iran’s nuclear capability and a disruptive American influence – is topical and refreshing. After a rocky start, the pace picks up across a string of strong middle episodes, but latter stories falter as the writing side-lines the Iran arc to tie up a variety of ongoing subplots. It’s almost as if the show is a little unsure of itself at the beginning, with the first few episodes proving unnoteworthy as the show scrambles to set up character arcs and subplots. (That being said, the opening two-parter, which deals with a contagious virus spreading through the streets of London, makes for an uncomfortably scary watch in light of the current global pandemic.)<br
