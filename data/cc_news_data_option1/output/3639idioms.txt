If a deal can be done between United and Real Madrid for Reguilon, it will be good for United to have a left-back that is experienced and able to challenge Luke Shaw for the starting position in the team, also help Brandon Williams develop into a player that could rival both Reguilon and Shaw for the role in the years to come, or even challenge Aaron Wan-Bissaka in the right-back role, which is the role Williams has played in more often in the clubs academy, before coming through into the first team last season to cover for an injured Shaw.

Muhittin AtamanFor the last decade, the main concern of Turkish foreign policy has been the crises in the Middle East and North Africa, which include threats emanating from different terrorist groups and state failures as a result of Arab insurgencies. Ankara, however, has been spending its energy on its relations with Western countries, especially France and the United States, rather than on these crises. Nowadays, many observers both from inside and outside the nation have been trying to answer the question, “What does the West want from Turkey?” In this piece, I will try to trace the roots of Paris’ approach toward Ankara.As the leading anti-Turkish European state, France has been pursuing a policy designed to block and suppress Turkey, and it has been exploiting every opportunity to achieve this objective. When considering regional realities and recent developments, it becomes clear that Ankara has been trying to prevent anti-Turkey projects in the region and get rid of the blockade targeted by France.First of all, there is an anti-Turkey alliance forming in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East. Other regional countries such as Greece, Israel, Egypt and other states have been isolating Turkey from initiatives in the area. Paris has been leading this otherization policy, which indicates their “siege policy” against Ankara. According to the French government, Turkey should not be presented as the model nation for other regional countries, and therefore the “Turkish experience” must be doomed to fail.Second, France has been unhappy with Turkey’s new foreign policy orientation and its increasing effectiveness in the region. Paris holds Ankara responsible for the decline of its influence in the Middle East and North Africa. After Ankara’s direct intervention into the Syrian crisis and its four military operations there, France became alarmed that Turkey would dominate Syria, its old colony, possibly ending their influence. Considering the limited objectives of the United States and Russia, France was expecting a bigger role for itself at the beginning of the political process for the resolution of the civil war. Turkey, however, continues to be at the heart of the Syrian crisis, and it seems that it will be impossible to solve the conflict without Ankara’s approval.Similarly, France holds Turkey responsible for the failure of its plans in Libya. Paris was about to solve the crisis there and maintain its economic interests by supporting the illegitimate warlord Gen. Khalifa Haftar and his allies. Ankara has changed the balance of power on the ground against the putschist’s forces, which are supported not only by France but also other states such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt and Russia. Turkey, together with Libya’s legitimate government, broke the French project. As such, Paris has been virulently following an anti-Turkish stance in North Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean.Third, as a result of France’s unhappiness with Turkey’s rising position and effectiveness in the region, they have been at the center of almost all anti-Ankara developments in different crises, including the Syrian civil war, the conflict in Libya and the current tension in the Eastern Mediterranean. France has been trying to mobilize every anti-Turkish political actor it can find and provide them limitless support.For this reason, Paris has been provoking Athens to continue to defend its maximalist position in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Aegean Sea. Similarly, France has been trying to prevent any Turkish influence in Lebanon. Since it prioritizes its colonial interests, it does not even want Ankara to provide humanitarian assistance to Beirut or bring peace and stability to the country. France wants Lebanon politically divided and therefore dependent on external powers, such as Paris.French President Emmanuel Macron is not only mobilizing hostile forces in the region but also trying to turn Turkey’s friends against them. Macron has been visiting different Middle Eastern capitals and is utilizing both stick and carrot policies to set then against Ankara. Recently, the French president has been meeting with different regional politicians and trying to persuade them to support his Middle Eastern projections. For instance, Macron has met with the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), Nechirvan Barzani, in Baghdad. Turkey quickly answered, however, interfering with possible developments by inviting Barzani to Ankara. France has also been instrumentalizing the European Union for its national interests by forcing the bloc’s institutions to take measures and even to impose sanctions against Turkey.Fourth, France has been trying to throw out Turkey from Europe and has been one of the fiercest anti-Ankara states in the EU as it has been insistently rejecting their membership accession. Likewise, Paris has been trying to undermine Ankara’s NATO membership. France always prefers to boost defense cooperation among “European” countries, excluding both the United States and Turkey.For all these reasons, France has been rancorously following an ambitious and aggressive anti-Turkey policy, mobilizing every adversarial political actor against Ankara. It seems that France and Macron will continue to exploit and to instrumentalize Turkey for its ultra-European policy and for its regional perspective. France has been trying to declare Turkey as the main “other” of Europe, but this perspective is not shared by the continent’s other countries. As such, this policy may create further diffusion, rather than the consolidation of European integration.In addition, Paris may continue to buy support from regional regimes for some time, but it cannot sustain its impact in the area by following a zero-sum relationship with its ex-colonial states. France does not have the capacity to maintain a unilateral policy without the support of the other Western countries, some of which are at odds with their agendas. France can play its game only when the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany hesitate to follow a proactive policy in the region.[Daily Sabah, 9 September 2020]

He scheduled at least one high- dollar fundraiser there over the weekend — as well as one in Washington before he flies west — as he looks to assuage growing concerns that he could fall short of cash. Couples were asked for $150,000 for the Las Vegas fundraiser. The Republican National Committee said the $18 million expected to be raised over the weekend would be shared by Trump’s campaign, the committee and several state GOP committees.

What lessons have been learned? What lessons will be taught? What past experiences can be put to good use to prepare for what's down the road?
 All these questions and more were on the minds of leaders this past week as they returned to work after the extended Labor Day weekend, staring at the reality of time and the fact that the dreaded "fall resurgence" could actually be right around the corner.
 "There's a lot of scenario planning going on," Gov. Charlie Baker said Tuesday, confronted with the possibility that the days of sub-1% positive testing rates may be numbered.
 Those scenarios include making sure hospitals that survived the first wave of coronavirus without getting overrun are prepared again. And that the state's testing labs are ready to handle the increased volume that could come from more college and grade school students getting tested, as well as people confusing symptoms from fall colds and the old-fashioned flu with COVID-19.
 CommonWealth magazine reported that Partners in Health, which runs the state's contact tracing program, is staffing up for the fall, and some outbreaks cropped up on campuses like Boston College's.
 But for now, the trends remain positive -- even with the number of communities in the highest risk "red" category climbing by five to 13 this week.
 Cool creativity
 The unofficial end of summer also means rethinking how some of the creative steps taken to allow the economy to begin to recover in the warm weather can be extended to chillier autumn days and night.
 Baker visited Medford's Bistro 5 on Thursday to announce that he was doubling the size of the Shared Streets and Spaces grant program from $5 million to $10 million to help restaurant owners afford modifications like heat lamps to extend the life of their new outdoor patios.
 The governor also said that while the going was good he was prepared to allow outdoor and indoor arcades to reopen starting this week, a change to the reopening plan that came after the owner of the Salem arcade Bit Bar sued the administration, questioning why his business was being treated differently than casinos.
 That's not to say that's the whole reason Baker decided to open arcades. But the courts are starting to become that player off the bench who just may have an out-sized impact on the final outcome of the game (Baker's authority, eviction policy, serving out prison sentences, etc.).
 Official in Franklin
 The results are in. In Franklin, that is.
 Local vote tallies for the Sept. 1 primary were posted to the town clerk's website late this week, about 10 days after residents visited the polls.
 Franklin was the last community in the 4th Congressional District to post results from the Sept. 1 primary, owing to about 3,000 overlooked ballots. A spokesperson for the Secretary of State's Office said the state only had Franklin's Democratic ballot results as of Friday afternoon. State officials helped oversee the final tally of those ballots.
 Many municipalities post unofficial results on the night of an election, then post official results a few days later, once they've been certified. Franklin officials said last week that they wouldn't post any results until they had the certified version.
 On the Democratic ballot, Franklin residents gave the hotly contested U.S. Senate race to former U.S. Rep. Joseph Kennedy over eventual winner Edward Markey, 3,918-3,178. In the Republican U.S. Senate race, Franklin chose the winner, Kevin O'Connor, over Shiva Ayyadurai, 1,114-699.
 In the nine-way Democratic race for Kennedy's vacated 4th District seat, winner Jake Auchincloss was the top vote-getter in Franklin, with 1,538 votes. Becky Grossman was just 156 votes behind (1,382), with Jesse Mermell -- Auchincloss' closest competitor district wide -- a distant third with 882.
 Oddly, there were nearly 600 blanks.
 On the Republican side, nominee Julie Hall topped David Rosa, 1,119-616.
 Teacher ruling
 The Commonwealth Employment Relations Board fired a shot across the bow of teachers unions when it ruled against the Andover Education Association, finding that teachers who refused to enter school buildings and classrooms on Aug. 31 for back-to-school safety training had participated in an illegal strike.
 It didn't matter, the board said, that teachers deemed the school buildings unsafe and set up in school yards outside with laptops and prepared to work. They don't have the authority, the CERB decided, to decide where they report for duty.
 Baker said he agreed with the decision, and that there was nothing unsafe about returning to a "basically empty" school building for professional development.
 But Massachusetts Teachers Association President Merrie Najimy lit into the governor and his administration for not starting school remotely this fall, and said the ruling would not stop teachers in other communities from doing what they needed to do to protect themselves.
 With students in many communities prepared to either return to the classroom or fire up their Zoom rooms this week, the back-and-forth between local unions, school committees and the administration all point to a tense week to come and uncertainty about how much learning will actually be taking place.
 Silent six months
 And finally, Wednesday marks half a year since Senate President Spilka and House Speaker DeLeo closed the State House to the public amid the flaring COVID-19 pandemic.
 The two announced March 16 that the building would be closed starting that evening, and Spilka said it would remain closed "through the duration of the state of emergency." Earlier that day, the Senate conducted its business before a largely empty chamber and a virtual audience -- broadcasting an informal session on the internet for the first time.
 Rumors have periodically swirled under the Golden Dome about when the doors might reopen to members of the public, but Baker, DeLeo and Spilka have pretty much stayed mum on the subject. Baker said earlier this summer that the building is under the Legislature's control, while legislative leaders have deferred to the administration on the building's status.
 The Bureau of the State House website initially said that events scheduled to take place this spring inside the building could be rescheduled for the fall, but the site now simply states, "The Massachusetts State House is closed to the public until further notice."
 They said it...
 "We of course believe this is the wrong decision. The last time they closed us we went into vigil because they were not reversing that decision. We decided we needed to do this prayerful protest again." -- Jamie Hanson, parishioner at St. Anselm Catholic Church in Sudbury, reacting to the Boston Archdiocese's decision to close the parish this fall.
 "It's possible, at least for this year, that the state … (may) allow districts to go remote during snow days. It wouldn't be that big of a lift for our teachers or our school because they'll be very, very engaged in remote learning." -- Kevin McIntyre, superintendent of schools in Milford, commenting on the possibility that snow days would be eliminated from the school calendar.
 Contributors to the Political Notebook this week include Deputy Director of Multimedia Dan O'Brien, multimedia jourmalist Alison Bosma and the State House News Service.

COLLETON COUNTY S.C. (WCSC) - The Colleton County Fire Department says they rescued a 94-year-old man after he accidentally overturned a tractor while mowing his grass in the town of Smoaks.First responders say the man was trapped under his tractor after the piece of equipment rolled down an embankment shortly after 3 p.m. Wednesday.Firefighters say they were dispatched to the 100 block of South Carolina Highway 217 in Smoaks where friends and family directed them approximately 900 feet along the dike to the where the tractor was located.They say the man was working alone, mowing grass on a dike surrounding a large pond when the tractor apparently got too close to the edge and overturned.The crews say rescue tools and air bags were deemed inadequate because of all the water and mud around the scene, but equipment was eventually hauled by pickup trucks into the location using a winch rigged to a tree.First responders say fortunately the man had a cellphone with him and was able to call for assistance after the tractor landed at the water’s edge and pinned the victim’s leg under the tractor’s side cutter.The man was found to be in stable condition and firefighters say they used shovels to begin digging under the tractor in an attempt to free the man’s leg.The crews say rescue tools and air bags were deemed inadequate because of all the water and mud around the scene, but equipment was eventually hauled by pickup trucks into the location using a winch rigged to a tree.Finally a backhoe was able to get to the incident and first responders say they were able to dig out enough mud to free the man after about 30 minutes.The man was carried out of the field by firefighters and EMS says they transported the victim to Colleton Medical center.Copyright 2020 WCSC.

ANTONY STARR: We were all pretty excited about Season 1. There’s no such thing as a perfect TV show, but I think we got off to a good start. There was a lot of positive stuff to lean into. Having been on shows that go to Season 2, they lose track of what the positive was and how to really navigate Season 2, so from my perspective, I didn’t have any specifics around what I wanted to see. I just wanted it to be a good follow-up/step up from Season 1. The great thing is that our boss/creator and showrunner of the show Eric Kripke said, “We’re not gonna try to go bigger. We’re gonna get deeper with the characters.” And then, you see the result and Season 2 is deeper, and somehow bigger, as well. He fibbed a little bit. The really satisfying thing about Season 2 is that it does get deeper with the characters, across the board. Everyone has strong wants, and it makes for a very entertaining second season of TV.

Neymar has signed an endorsement contract with Puma to become the German sportswear giant's new global poster boy on Saturday two weeks after the Brazilian superstar parted company with longtime sponsor Nike.
 "Welcome to the fam @neymarjr #KingIsBack" Puma tweeted alongside a photo of the Paris Saint-Germain striker, kitted out in his new marketing 'club's' clothes.
 The world's most expensive player confirmed the sponsorship transfer in an open letter posted on social media.
 "I grew up watching videos of great football legends such as Pele, Cruyff, Eusebio and Maradona...who each played in Puma.
 "For these reasons, from today onward, I have the honour to unite with the brand that helped the biggest legends of football become what they are," he wrote.
 Neither Neymar nor Puma gave details of the length of the contract or how much it was worth.
 "Neymar Jr...is an ambassador of the brand on and off the pitch," the company told AFP, emphasising the confidentiality around the contract.
 The move represents a significant change for the 28-year-old after leaving Nike, his sponsors since he was a 13-year-old prodigy.
 \- Puma statue -
 News that a deal had been struck was first published by Brazilian sports site Esporte Interativo, which is known for breaking the story of Neymar's transfer from Barcelona to PSG in 2017.
 Citing "exclusive information," it said details on the agreement and Neymar's first promotional appearances for Puma were expected "in the coming days".
 Neymar had appeared to drop hints that a deal was close, said Esporte Interativo.
 He recently followed Puma, PumaFootball and eight other accounts associated with the brand on Instagram, and posted a picture of himself Thursday with what appeared to be a statue of a puma in the background.
 Neymar's last arrangement with Nike was reportedly an 11-year contract up to 2022 worth a total $105 million (88 millions euros).
 Forbes magazine, which ranks him the world's seventh highest-paid celebrity, estimates his earnings for this year at $95.5 million, including endorsement deals.
 At Nike, the world leading sportswear company with turnover of 39.1 billion euros in 2019, Neymar was one of many headline sports stars like LeBron James, Rafael Nadal, Serena Williams, Cristiano Ronaldo and Kylian Mbappe.
 With his new Puma 'family' he will instantly assume a leading marketing role alongside six-time Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton.
 For the German firm, whose sales fell by over 16% in the first quarter of 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, Neymar's capture should pay dividends in the medium term.
 Neymar is a fitting replacement to another global sports star in the Puma family but now retired - Usain Bolt.
 PSG paid a record 222 million euros for his transfer from Barcelona in 2017.
 With his skinny good looks, tattoos, ever-changing hairstyles and huge following on social media, Neymar is one of the biggest names in sports and beyond -- though his brand has been tarnished at times.
 On the pitch, critics accuse him of diving in matches. Off the pitch, he has faced accusations of tax fraud and a 2019 rape allegation.
 Brazilian police later dismissed the latter case, citing a lack of evidence.
 He was forced to miss PSG's Ligue 1 season-opener on Thursday after testing positive for Covid-19 following a holiday in Ibiza after PSG's Champions League final defeat to Bayern Munich.
 Despite his move, Neymar's links with Nike are not severed completely as he will continue to wear the brand when playing for two of their clients - Brazil and PSG - on the pitch.

There are no prima donnas or princess, and I don’t mean female princesses. I include men in that. There are no divas. It makes for a really great work environment.

NEW YORK (AP) — Century 21 Stores — a destination for bargain hunters looking for fat deals on designer dresses and shoes, cosmetics and housewares for nearly 60 years — has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and is winding down its business, shutting all 13 stores across New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Florida.Century 21 joins more than two dozen retailers who have filed for bankruptcy since the pandemic, which forced non-essential stores to temporarily close.In a statement, the New York-based company said that the decision followed nonpayment by the company’s insurance providers of approximately $175 million due under policies put in place to protect against losses stemming from business interruption. Insurance money helped it rebuild its flagship store, a magnet for locals and tourists in downtown Manhattan after it was damaged by the 9/11 attacks, the company said.“We now have no viable alternative but to begin the closure of our beloved family business because our insurers, to whom we have paid significant premiums every year for protection against unforeseen circumstances like we are experiencing today, have turned their backs on us at this most critical time,” said Century 21 co- CEO Raymond Gindi in statement.Gindi said that if Century 21 had received “any meaningful portion” of the insurance proceeds, it would have been able “to save thousands of jobs and weather the storm in hopes of another incredible recovery.”The company said that it’s removing to the bankruptcy court a lawsuit pending in the Supreme Court of the State of New York against several of its insurance providers based on their failure to compensate the company for its losses under the policies. The company is requesting that the bankruptcy court expedite the adjudication of the suit for the benefit of its stakeholders.Century 21 says it’s starting going-out-of business sales at all of its stores and online.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

STARR: One of the things I really dig about the show is that it is grotesque, it is out there, it is gonna go places other shows won’t go, and it’s not apologetic about it. It’s refreshing to see a show that is prepared to stray into those areas and also is not afraid to shock people or surprise people. People often say, when they see a film or a TV show that has something for shock value, that it’s a negative. To a certain extent, isn’t everything shock value that’s interesting, to a certain extent. There are different levels of shock. To me, shock value is only one step further down the track from surprise. Nothing wants to be formulaic and not surprising. I dig the show, and I like that it’s out there and you don’t know what’s coming next. It comes back to your taste and sensibilities. Part of the reason that we watch TV shows and films is that it’s a healthy form of escapism. We wanna be transported out of our norm and into an imaginary world and told a story, and a big part of that is seeing things that you would never ordinarily see. Not always. Sometimes it’s relating to things. But that relationship with the taboo or the shocking is part of film and TV, across the board, and always has been. It’s part of art. When it comes to what’s good and what’s bad, to each their own.

Dominic Thiem and Alexander Zverev are both looking to bag a breakthrough first Grand Slam title when they face off behind closed doors in the US Open final on Sunday.
 It will be the 27-year-old Thiem's fourth major tennis final and his second in a row after reaching the last-two in Australia this year, while Zverev, 23, is playing his first.
 Thiem joked after his straight-sets semi-final victory over Daniil Medvedev that if he loses, he might have to contact a multiple-Slam winner who lost four finals before winning his first, and then going on to win two more.
 "If I win, I have my first. If not, I probably have to call Andy Murray (about) how it is with zero," the Austrian said ahead of the showdown inside Arthur Ashe Stadium.
 Sunday's showpiece brings to a close a US Open unlike any other -- the coronavirus pandemic meant no fans have been allowed into Flushing Meadows and players have been tested for COVID-19 regularly.
 This year's field at the Billie Jean King US National Tennis Center in New York was also depleted by the absence of Swiss legend Roger Federer and defending champion Rafael Nadal.
 The tournament was also blown wide open by the disqualification of world number one and heavy favorite Novak Djokovic in the last 16 for hitting a line judge with the ball.
 It means the 2020 US Open will crown a first-time Grand Slam champion for the first time since Croatian Marin Cilic won at Flushing Meadows in 2014.
 It also means a Grand Slam champion other than Djokovic, Nadal or Federer for the first time since Switzerland's Stan Wawrinka won the third of his majors at the 2016 US Open.
 For Thiem, also a runner-up at the French Open in 2018 and 2019, it is a golden opportunity to clinch that elusive first Slam title.
 "It's the biggest goal and also the biggest dream I have in my tennis career since a few years," said Thiem, who lost in five sets to Djokovic in Melbourne this year.
 "It was really tough to digest that loss in Australia as I was super close back then. I'm happy that I gave myself a pretty short time after that (for) another chance."
 \- 'Huge pressure' -
 Thiem is 7-2 against Zverev, with whom he says he has a "a great friendship and a great rivalry," including a four-set win in the semi-finals during that run to the Melbourne finals.
 Thiem admits there is "huge pressure," with both he and Zverev "working very hard since a long time" to enter the pantheon of Slam champions.
 "I expect a very tough, very open match," said the world number three.
 "His first serve is one of, if not, the best out there right now. It's so fast, so precise. That will be a key point. Try to put many balls back in play."
 Zverev is the first German man to reach the final of a tennis major since Rainer Schuttler at the 2003 Australian Open.
 He is also bidding to become the first German to win the US Open since Boris Becker in 1989.
 Zverev has looked less convincing than Thiem throughout his run to the final, at times struggling with second serves and groundstroke forehands.
 But he will be brimming with confidence after coming from two sets down for the first time in his career to beat Spain's Pablo Carreno Busta and reach the final.
 He also has, arguably, less to lose.
 "I have a chance. I'm looking forward to it. I'm just excited about it," said Zverev, the world number seven.

LONDON (AP) — Oxford University announced Saturday it was resuming a trial for a coronavirus vaccine it is developing with pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, a move that comes days after the study was suspended following a reported side-effect in a U.K. patient.In a statement, the university confirmed the restart across all of its U.K. clinical trial sites after regulators gave the go-ahead following the pause on Sunday.“The independent review process has concluded and following the recommendations of both the independent safety review committee and the U.K. regulator, the MHRA, the trials will recommence in the U.K.,” it said.The vaccine being developed by Oxford and AstraZeneca is widely perceived to be one of the strongest contenders among the dozens of coronavirus vaccines in various stages of testing around the world.British Health Secretary Matt Hancock welcomed the restart, saying in a tweet that it was “good news for everyone” that the trial is “back up and running.”The university said in large trials such as this “it is expected that some participants will become unwell and every case must be carefully evaluated to ensure careful assessment of safety.”It said globally some 18,000 people have received its vaccine so far in Britain, Brazil and South Africa. Around 30,000 volunteers are being recruited in the U.S.Although Oxford would not disclose information about the patient’s illness due to participant confidentiality, an AstraZeneca spokesman said earlier this week that a woman had developed severe neurological symptoms that prompted the pause. Specifically, the woman is said to have developed symptoms consistent with transverse myelitis, a rare inflammation of the spinal cord.The university insisted that it is “committed to the safety of our participants and the highest standards of conduct in our studies and will continue to monitor safety closely.”Pauses in drug trials are commonplace and the temporary hold led to a sharp fall in AstraZeneca’s share price following the announcement Tuesday.The Oxford-AstraZeneca study had been previously stopped in July for several days after a participant developed neurological symptoms that turned out to be an undiagnosed case of multiple sclerosis that researchers said was unrelated to the vaccine.During the third and final stage of testing, researchers look for any signs of possible side effects that may have gone undetected in earlier patient research. Because of their large size, the studies are considered the most important study phase for picking up less common side effects and establishing safety. The trials also assess effectiveness by tracking who gets sick and who doesn’t between patients getting the vaccine and those receiving a dummy shot.Dr. Charlotte Summers, a lecturer in intensive care medicine at the University of Cambridge, said the pause was a sign that the Oxford team was putting safety issues first, but that it led to “much unhelpful speculation.”“To tackle the global COVID-19 pandemic, we need to develop vaccines and therapies that people feel comfortable using, therefore it is vital to maintaining public trust that we stick to the evidence and do not draw conclusions before information is available,” she said.Scientists around the world, including those at the World Health Organization, have sought to keep a lid on expectations of an imminent breakthrough for coronavirus vaccines, stressing that vaccine trials are rarely straightforward.Two other vaccines are in huge, final-stage tests in the United States, one made by Moderna Inc. and the other by Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

That was pretty funny. In terms of what we’re actually doing, the system that pulls you up on the harness is not always mechanical. Sometimes it was handheld. I was literally 40 feet in the air, a couple of times, and maybe it’s not your life but it certainly feels like it when you’re that high up in the air with concrete. It certainly feels like your life is on the line. Nothing actually happened. It’s a very safe set, so it’s pretty amazing.

Lewis Hamilton claimed a record-increasing 95th pole position on Saturday when he outpaced Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas to seize the prime grid position in qualifying for Sunday's inaugural Tuscan Grand Prix.
 It was the series leader and six-time champion's seventh pole in eight races this year as Mercedes continued their dominant run to nine poles out of nine this season with an eighth consecutive front row lockout.
 "It's been a really tough weekend, if I'm honest," said Hamilton. "Firstly, this track is phenomenal -- it's a really challenging circuit and you saw Valtteri was quicker than me all day yesterday and even this morning.
 "But I've been working hard in the background to improve on my lines and set up and the engineers and mechanics did a great job, so finally I got the lap that I needed."
 Bottas had been fastest in all three practice sessions, but he was unable to maintain his superiority over Hamilton in the decisive hour albeit that his second run was affected by yellow flags after Esteban Ocon spun in his Renault.
 "The yellow flag definitely hampered me – I had more time to come, but didn't get the opportunity to do it," said Bottas. "It's disappointing as I've been quick all weekend. It's a long run to Turn One tomorrow and the headwind could help me there."
 \- Ferrari escape embarrassment -
 Red Bull's Max Verstappen was third ahead of his team-mate Alex Albon with Charles Leclerc claiming fifth for Ferrari, as they celebrate their 1000th Grand Prix at their own circuit.
 "I didn't expect to fight for pole, but overall this has been a promising weekend," said the Dutchman. "We have bounced back well from Monza where it was tricky so, at the end, to be third here...We can be happy with that.
 "This track is amazing to drive and qualifying was really something special."
 Hamilton agreed.
 "The track is crazy," he said. "You go through Turns Six, Seven, Eight and Nine at 170-180 mph and the G-force we're pulling is insane -- it gets more and more as you go through.
 "Valtteri did a great job pushing me, so I'm really, really happy to be on pole."
 Leclerc said he was surprised and delighted.
 "I'm very happy with the lap overall," he said. "P5 is higher than our expectations, so we're very happy. Monza and Spa were very disappointing.
 "The balance was good today and gave me confidence and in the end we made it happen.
 "I think it helps that we had experience of the track in FP1, but onwards, all the guys are F1 drivers and can get up to speed quickly. There's a good opportunity tomorrow, but there was quite a lot of cars that had better race pace on Friday."
 Sergio Perez, who faces a one-place grid penalty for his brush with Kimi Raikkonen on Friday, qualified sixth ahead of his Racing Point team-mate Lance Stroll, Daniel Ricciardo of Renault, Carlos Sainz of McLaren and Ocon.
 On a glorious day in the Tuscan hills, the air temperature was 29 degrees Celsius and the track 46 as Q1 began with Bottas topping Hamilton by almost three-tenths, leaving Verstappen adrift by half a second in third.
 Perez was fifth behind Albon with Leclerc in sixth while, in the drop zone, Vettel scrambled through to Q2 in his Ferrari to dump last Sunday's Monza winner Pierre Gasly into 16th.
 That meant the Frenchman was eliminated along with Antonio Giovinazzi of Alfa Romeo, the two Williams of George Russell and Nicholas Latifi and Haas's Kevin Magnussen.
 Lando Norris then missed out on the top 10 shootout along with Daniil Kvyat of Alpha Tauri, Kimi Raikkonen of Alfa Romeo, Vettel and Romain Grosjean of Haas.

Liverpool start their Premier League title defence against Leeds on Saturday after Arsenal made a flying start to the new season with a 3-0 win at Fulham.
 Jurgen Klopp's side begin a season as English champions for the first time since 1990 when they host Marcelo Bielsa's promoted Leeds on the opening day of the 2020-21 campaign.
 Just 48 days after last season's delayed conclusion, the Premier League is back and Arsenal hit the ground running with the kind of confident display that has become their hallmark since Mikel Arteta took charge.
 Arsenal's free-flowing attack was too incisive for promoted Fulham and Alexandre Lacazette gave the visitors an early lead at Craven Cottage.
 Brazilian defender Gabriel Magalhaes scored Arsenal's second after the break in his first appearance since his close-season move from Lille.
 Aubameyang added the final flourish with a typically eye-catching strike that emphasised why Arsenal are so desperate for the Gabon forward to sign an extension to the contract which expires at the end of the season.
 Gunners boss Arteta had good news for fans concerned Aubameyang might leave as he revealed their team's talisman is set to sign the contract offer.
 "I'm really positive we are going to get it done very soon and hopefully in the next few days you will get some news," Arteta told BT Sport.
 With former Chelsea winger Willian providing a pair of assists on his debut, it was the ideal way for Arsenal to start a season that appears full of promise after last season's FA Cup triumph.
 Although their eighth-placed finish in the Premier League ranked as Arsenal's lowest final position since 1995, Arteta has been a much-needed breath of fresh air and pushing for a place in the top four should not be beyond his revitalised team this term.
 "I wanted to see my team determined to come to this difficult ground against a really good team that has been promoted. We had a lot of energy and did the things we trained on in this period," Arteta said.
 "Gabriel didn't play for six months before today. Mohamed Elneny was brilliant. He has been excellent in training. All the boys tried really hard."
 \- Liverpool eye 20th title -
 In the day's second game of the season, Crystal Palace beat Southampton 1-0 at Selhurst Park.
 Palace, who ended last season with seven defeats in their last eight games, took the lead in the 13th minute when Wilfried Zaha volleyed in from Andros Townsend's cross.
 Southampton defender Kyle Walker-Peters got a reprieve when he was harshly sent off for a high challenge on Tyrick Mitchell in the second half, with referee Jon Moss changing his decision to a yellow card after consulting the pitchside monitor.
 Danny Ings nearly snatched a last-gasp equaliser but his header was well saved by Vicente Guaita.
 While the continued absence of fans due to the coronavirus and shorter than usual break has taken a little anticipation away from the new campaign, Liverpool head into the new season looking to win to be crowned English champions for a record-equalling 20th time.
 Only Manchester United have won more than Liverpool's 19 top-flight titles, but reaching that historic total won't be easy for Klopp's team.
 Liverpool have watched title rivals Chelsea and Manchester City sign several expensive new players since the end of last season, while the Reds have been quiet in the transfer market.
 After losing the Community Shield to Arsenal on penalties last month, Leeds' visit to Anfield offers a chance for Klopp to assess whether his players are still hungry for silverware.
 Leeds are back in the top-flight for the first time in 16 years after winning the Championship last season.
 The late game sees West Ham host Newcastle, who have endured a turbulent close season marred by the failed takeover by a largely Saudi Arabia-backed consortium.

Marieve Herington: Yeah, like I said, it was just a really, really good learning experience, I think, to being different than when you're steering the ship, to jump into somebody else's vision. It wasn't a huge leap, because I feel like, from moment one, I felt like more than just a voice actor on _Big City Greens_. I feel like the creators, and the directors, the whole team has really allowed us actors, and I'll just speak from my experience, I feel like I've been able to contribute a lot creatively, more than just like the sound files that they get from me at the end of the day. There's a lot of back and forth, even just as an actor, about like, "Oh, okay, well, I feel like Tilly might not say that." Or "This feels really organic." And so I feel like I've always had a voice with regard to just maintaining the world of, specifically, Tilly, of course.

“I look at this (court) and I almost cried because it's gorgeous and it's state of the art, and there's nets on the basketball rims,” said Shannon Evers, CEO at Girls Scouts of Western Oklahoma. “People don't really realize a lot of kids in Oklahoma City and throughout our council don't actually have access to a basketball court that is this high quality and so colorful and fun and welcoming.”

We do think all of this does beg the question further as to why CBS and producers don't consider moving filming somewhere else, but the answer to that is fairly complicated. They may be in a situation here where it is too costly to move to another location or there aren't as many resources there -- remember that _Survivor_ stopped using different locations seasons ago, and there are challenges finding places that are cost-effective and also have enough housing for the crew during production. It's still a ratings success, but it's not the smash hit that it was back during the early days.
