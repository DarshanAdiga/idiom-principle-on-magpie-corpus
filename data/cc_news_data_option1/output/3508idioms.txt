Policy 303.6, entitled “Gas Guidelines,” of the Eau Claire Police Department policy manual states, “Gas may be used for crowd control, crowd dispersal or against barricaded suspects based on the circumstances.”
 Chief Matt Rokus, newly appointed at the beginning of this year, confirmed the gas referred to on page 57 of the document is CS gas, more commonly known as tear gas. Demonstrators in Kenosha, Minneapolis and Portland have been subjected to tear gas by police forces before, during and after the declaration of a protest becoming an unlawful assembly.
 The catalyst of carnage in Minneapolis this June was the action by Third Precinct officers to launch tear gas into the crowd on Lake Street. All hell broke loose. Seeing the chaos in Minneapolis and nationwide, the Eau Claire Justice League and I researched and examined CS gas; after which, we called for a ban on the use of tear gas as well as rubber bullets on crowds.
 In a meeting with Rokus, we brought these concerns and a petition with nearly 1,000 signatures to ban these munitions. Our intention was to work with the police, but they haven’t listened. Rokus preferred not to engage in any conversation about reform. He defended the use of tear gas claiming without this chemical weapon, ECPD would be forced to use more lethal options.
 Focusing on the right to assembly and the expectation to keep the peace, we offered alternatives to the seeming dichotomy of gas or lethal force. However, Rokus seemed disinterested in discussing alternatives. Talks shut down, and we were brushed aside. An invitation to a public forum was denied.
 Rokus has acknowledged the death of George Floyd. He implemented new policies within his department shortly after. But it seems the reforms stop there.
 CS gas was outlawed in warfare by the Geneva Protocol of 1925. Tear gas is not acceptable for our military to use, so why should the ECPD carry it? Tear gas can cause miscarriage and fetal harm, so why do we allocate tax dollars to it? So today, I have a proposal for the chief. To show the community the effects of tear gas, I am asking Rokus to join me in exposing ourselves to it in a controlled setting with the public present. If ECPD brings the gas, I’ll bring two gallons of milk.
 This is no joke. Let’s schedule a time and date. Of course if this option isn’t preferable, the police department can simply forsake the use of gas and throw away every last canister. Call your city council member. Call the PD. It’s time for us to stand up as a community against tear gas.
 Fight for what’s right.
  _Seidel is director of political operations for the Eau Claire Justice League._

Elizabeth Helen Cowman October 12, 1931 - September 2, 2020 Kechi, KS - Born October 12, 1931. She left this world peacefully after a long illness on September 2, 2020. Liz and her brother grew up on the family farm in Herrington, Kansas. Her parents, Louis and Winona Cowman were lifelong residents there. It was during that time that Liz developed her love of animals, large and small. She had a great love of rodeos and for many years attended the National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas with friends from high school and college. A great student, she attended Kansas State University and graduated in 1953 with a degree in computer programming. She started her first and ONLY job at Boeing in 1953 until her retirement. During her time at Boeing, she mentored many young men and women who would later become part of the executive leadership team at Boeing. In a world where company loyalty is harder to find, she was a successful and proud member of her team until her retirement. One of Liz' great passions were photography. She also loved gardens and flowers. For years, her service as a volunteer at Botanica served as her photographic muse and most of Liz' friends have collections of her beautiful photography on their walls. Liz had a particular love of dogs. Throughout her early life, she bred exhibited Shetland Sheepdogs in Obedience Trials across the Midwest. She was very successful. But it was her last Sheltie, Jiggs, that capped off Liz' years showing dogs. Jiggs was her most winning dog and finished 'Best in Trial' on numerous occasions. When Jiggs was older and retired from the ring, Liz began her service to the dog fancier community by volunteering her time and knowledge to both the Wichita Dog Training Club and the Wichita Kennel Club. In the late 70's she became interested in Miniature Poodles, partnering with her longtime friend, Pat Deshler to increase her involvement. She not only showed Poodles in Obedience, but also became a partner in the breeding and exhibiting of the Deshler line of Miniature Poodles. She quite enjoyed the experience and it proved to be quite successful—they bred the winning Best of Show at the 1986 Poodle Club of America National Specialty. She loved those dogs and continued to have miniature poodles as companions until her death. In 2005, Liz undertook another volunteer project, helping Beth and Jay Tully launch Cocoa Dolce Chocolates. In her position of cheerleader, grocery runner and chief taster, she impacted the entire staff with her dry wit, funny expressions and all- around good nature. When she could no longer physically manage day-to-day activities, she continued to support the growth of Beth's business until Beth lost the business in 2016. Liz is survived by her nephews, Jim Cowman of Kingman, Arizona and Gary Cowman of Griffith, Indiana, as well as hordes of friends from every walk of life. For all of those who knew Liz, you know she did not want to be fussed about or over. She chose to forego a funeral and will be buried next to her parents in the Lost Springs Cemetery in Lost Springs, Kansas at a later date. For anyone that would like to honor Liz and her life, a memorial has been established with the Poodle Club of America Foundation (www.poodleclubofamericafoundation.org) where Liz was a founding member, as well as the Kansas Humane Society (www.kshumane.org).

In order to gather this data, those who claimed they have used cannabis in past years were recruited online to take a survey about their usage history. If folks reported that they used both cannabis flower and concentrates, they were then asked questions about the effects of both. Questions related to cognitive function, psychotic-like experiences, physiological effects, and reduced consciousness.
 Those polled claimed they use flower between five and six times per week and concentrates just a little over once per month. Results also showed that cannabis was associated with producing overall positive effects, including better cognitive functions.
 “Cannabis concentrates have much higher concentrations of THC than marijuana (flower) and are quickly gaining popularity in the United States,” the study explained. “One hypothesis is that use of higher-THC cannabis (concentrates) might result in greater intoxication and more severe acute negative effects than lower-THC cannabis (marijuana), but few studies have compared the subjective effects of concentrates and marijuana.”
 NORML Deputy Director Paul Armentano added his two cents about the findings, stating, “The conclusion that most marijuana consumers prefer low-to-moderate potency options over high potency options is hardly surprising. Just as the majority of those who consume alcohol prefer relatively low potency beer or wine over hard liquor, most adult-use cannabis consumers gravitate toward herbal cannabis preparations and away from the comparatively stronger alternatives.”
 Alternative cannabis options like concentrates and edibles are extremely helpful for some people who aren’t able to smoke or use flower, but this survey shows that there will always be room for the classics in the cannabis community, including the most basic way to consume.

Rodney Lee Jones April 14, 1953 Aug 30, 2020 Rodney Lee Jones, of Overland Park, KS, passed away peacefully at his home on August 30, 2020 with his wife, children and loved ones at his side. He was 67 years old. Rod was born in Beloit, KS to Walter and Ardis Jones. He was raised on a farm in Jewell County. The third oldest of seven children, he attended a one room schoolhouse, Pleasant Plain. The family moved to the nearby town of Glen Elder, where he completed grade school and began high school. They then moved to Effingham, KS where Rod graduated high school from Atchison County Community High School in 1971. Throughout high school, Rod excelled in all sports football, baseball, basketball, and track. He went on to play football at Hutchinson Community College, but later transferred to Kansas State University, where he received his degree in Business Accounting and Agriculture. Although Rod was always a country boy at heart, he made his transition to the "big city" after college and through his network of friends, met the love of his life, Michelle. They were married in August of 1987 and had two children: Callie Michelle and Samuel Lee, both currently residing in the Kansas City area. Rod was successful in so many aspects of his life, but being a husband and father were ultimately his two proudest roles. Rod's professional career began in Accounting, which eventually led him to the Commercial Real Estate industry where his "numbers guy" background helped him discover his passion for Investment Brokerage. He spent over 20 years with Colliers International and made his mark as one of the most well respected, top office brokers in the KC Metro. Rod's love of hunting, farming and sports created his ideal balance of work and play. He never missed an opportunity to go back home to hunt pheasant or quail and help his cousins with annual summer wheat harvest. Rod regularly attended K-State games and spent many summer nights at Kauffman Stadium watching his beloved Royals. Rod is survived by his wife of 33 years, Michelle; their loving children; son Sam, daughter Callie (John) and grandson Patrick, mother Ardis and his siblings Danny (Carolyn), Janis (Russel), Bryan (Sherry), Julie (Fred), John (Rachelle) and many nieces, nephews and cousins. Rod was preceded in death by his father, Walter, sister Janelle, and niece Lara. Due to the current restrictions and ongoing pandemic, an intimate memorial service was held amongst close family and friends. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to the Alzheimer's Association to assist in funding for dementia and Alzhemier's research.

Cannabis containing THC may not yet be legal in Hong Kong, or in most of Asia, but there is already a CBD cafe up and running in the Sheung Wan district. Currently in the soft-opening phase, the cafe will be fully open next month with a complete menu of CBD offerings.
 Chic and stylish, Found, the region’s first CBD cafe, sells a full range of CBD-based cannabis products, including vials of CBD oil for personal use, powders to be added to foods such as oil and butters, and other products, including products for pets who need pain relief. They even sell CBD-infused beer and coffee for those who want to stay awhile in the cafe.
 The staff are said to be caring and compassionate, happy to help everyone from the seasoned CBD user looking for a specific product to tourists and folks who have no idea what CBD is or what it can be used for.
 "Most people are seeking help with sleep; we also have parents with children with epilepsy or cerebral palsy here who are using our products," says Fiachra Mullen, co-owner of Altum International, the cannabinoids supplier in the Asia Pacific area that owns and operates Found.
 ## Wellness Trends
 Like many parts of the world, CBD has become trendy in Hong Kong with groups who practice yoga, mindfulness, and other self-care. Mullen also feels that CBD has become helpful for dealing with all the issues that come along with 2020.
 "Much of it is driven by the year that Hong Kong has had with the protests and the pandemic. A lot of the customers take it first thing in the morning with their coffee before they leave the house, it helps with mindfulness and makes them a bit more resilient to whatever happens that day."
 Still, while the shop is doing well and CBD is popular, partially because herbal remedies have credibility in Hong Kong, there is still a stigma against cannabis, even non-psychoactive cannabis, that is not easy to shake, and Mullen fears not being able to reach a full spectrum of customers.
 "There's a large part of the population that I'm not reaching," says Mullen.
 Still, there is hope for CBD use in Hong Kong to grow. All across Asia, cannabis is often part of ancient traditional, herbal remedies from throughout history. However, all the cannabis criminalization from over the years has taken its toll, and now, like in North America, many people are skeptical of it having any benefit at all. This is especially true with the older generation, but Mullen aims to change that.
 "My dream profile customer is a 65-year-old Hong Kong woman," confesses Mullen. "If I can have her and her husband walk in and learn about, or even just hear the word 'cannabis,' and not run a mile, then it's mission accomplished."
 Hong Kong, and the rest of Asia, will be watching to see how this CBD cafe is received and what the future of CBD and cannabis will look like in the East.
