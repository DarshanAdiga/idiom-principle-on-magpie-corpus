It was the first hit of the game for Markakis, who said he was upset about failing in previous attempts to drive in a run.
 "To me, we really shouldn't have been in that situation," said the 36-year-old Markakis. "I had a couple chances to push a run across there and we didn't. That's the beauty of this game. You always get another opportunity."
 Markakis announced his return one week ago, three weeks after opting out due to coronavirus concerns, Markakis lined the one-out homer off Wilmer Font (0-1) that carried into the restaurant behind the right-field stands.
 Markakis was added to the active roster on Wednesday after changing his mind about sitting out the year.
 Following the homer, Braves players circled home plate with plenty of distance, waving their hands in the air as Markakis finished his trot.
 "It was a little weird but that's the situation we're in," Markakis said. "We're still out here playing the game. We're still playing for everybody. We're still playing for the fans."
 Manager Brian Snitker said he is not surprised Markakis, 36, came back swinging.
 "That guy is going to look like that probably at 60 and be able to hit still," Snitker said.
 Mark Melancon (1-0) pitched a perfect ninth.
 Freddie Freeman hit a two-run homer in the first off Toronto rookie Nate Pearson.
 Bo Bichette hit a homer in the fourth for the Blue Jays.
 Right-hander Touki Toussaint gave the depleted Atlanta rotation a boost by setting career highs with his 6 2/3 innings and nine strikeouts.
 It was an important start for a rotation which lost ace Mike Soroka to a season-ending torn right Achilles tendon on Monday night. The rotation also has lost Mike Foltynewicz, who was designated for assignment and then sent to the team's alternate training site.
 Toussaint left the game with a 3-2 lead, but Blue Jays pinch-hitter Teoscar Hernández singled up the middle off Tyler Matzek to drive in Rowdy Tellez to tie the game. Toussaint gave up four hits and three runs with no walks.
 Pearson, making his second start, allowed three runs on two hits in five innings.
 "I really didn't have my best slider or my best fastball command, but I'm able to grind and still give my team a chance to win," Pearson said.
 Marcell Ozuna didn't look happy when a 96 mph fastball from Pearson sailed above his head in the fourth. Ozuna answered by lining a single to left field with an exit velocity of 110 mph.

One is to have the police actually do their jobs and stop trucks from going on these roads which are clearly marked to prohibit the trucks and for a solution to stop the trucks from getting too far down the road, sensors can be installed and warning lights can tell the trucks to "stop you idiot! your truck is too high for this road!"

Peter Cameron’snovel “What Happens at Night” (Catapult, 301 pages, $26) is an optical illusion. Consider it from one angle and you have the darkly comic tale of a Manhattan couple’s winter trip to a forgotten European backwater within the Arctic Circle, the site of the only orphanage willing to let them adopt a baby in spite of the wife’s late-stage cancer. There, while lodging at an absurdly grandiose hotel, they fall under the influence of an array of kooksand criminals who prey on them for their own idle designs. But relax your eyes and the book changes complexion, dissolving into an atmosphere of pure Gothic horror,...
