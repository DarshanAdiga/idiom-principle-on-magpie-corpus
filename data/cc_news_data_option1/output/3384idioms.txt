The fatal shootings Tuesday night took place after police drove away crowds that had gathered by the county courthouse. Videos showed shots being fired near a gas station that had been patrolled by an armed militia group.
 Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth described the armed gunmen as being “like a vigilante group” but said it was unclear if they were behind the shootings. Beth said one person who died was shot in the head and another in the chest.
 A cellphone video of two of those shootings was posted online. It shows a white male with a semiautomatic rifle running as he’s trailed by a crowd and officers. A voice says the male has shot someone. The video then shows the pursued male falling to the ground and firing his gun, hitting two people.
 Clashes have continued nightly in Kenosha, a city of 100,000 on Lake Michigan between Milwaukee and Chicago, since police shot Blake over the weekend as he tried to enter his gray SUV. Police have fired tear gas and rubber bullets as demonstrators chant, “No justice, no peace,” in front of the courthouse. Protesters have hurled bottles and fireworks at police, and set garbage trucks on fire. Ashes blew over a church that was partially burned after a lot was set ablaze next door.
 “We’ve long had problems with police in this area, and I’ve protested regularly since George Floyd died, but this is the most tense it’s been in a long time,” said Kejuan Goldsmith, a 19-year-old college student who lives just north in Racine and regularly visits his sister in Kenosha.
 “I’ve been out every night, and gotten tear-gassed twice even though I’ve been peaceful. In the short term, we want this officer fired; in the long term, we need broad change in our country over policing,” said Goldsmith, who is Black.

“One day, my brother said, 'Let's start a band,'” Jeff Taulton said.


  That day was back in the early '70s, and Jeff's big brother Howard Taulton was in high school at the time. Neither of the young men played an instrument, but Howard suggested he could learn to play guitar and Jeff could learn to play bass. They knew a kid down the street from their Boonsboro home who played drums, and they could have a band.


  Jeff Taulton, an avid athlete at the time, was on board. His grandmother bought him a bass guitar and amplifier from Montgomery Ward.

Tony Evers to increase the deployment of National Guard troops to help keep the peace. Trump also directed the Department of Justice to send FBI agents and U.S. marshals to the city as reinforcements, a day after a white 17-year-old who had been outspoken in support of police, was accused of killing two protesters and wounding another.

Liverpool fans may still be waiting for the party Jurgen Klopp promised them to celebrate last season’s long-awaited Premier League success, but they will begin the new campaign among the favourites to win another title.


  Klopp said the Reds would have to wait until the time was right to party with supporters as his players lifted the trophy, ending a 30-year wait to be crowned English champions again, at an empty Anfield in July.


  The coronavirus pandemic ravaged the 2019-20 season, forcing a three-month break in the spring, but Liverpool were not to be denied after an outstanding campaign in which they finished with 99 points, 18 clear of nearest rivals Manchester City.

  The only downside for them was that the closing stages had to be played behind closed doors, denying fans the chance to share the glory, but all clubs had to adapt and it is a situation that continues into the 2020-21 season that quickly follows.


  The key for Klopp’s side will be whether they can quickly get back to their destructive best after an understandable drop in intensity after clinching the title. After two extraordinary seasons – they reached 97 points and won the Champions League in 2018-19 – there are fears the natural drop-off could continue.


  That was the fate that befell City last season after their own back-to-back title wins of the previous two campaigns.


  Strengthened by the signings of Ferran Torres and Nathan Ake, and with the likelihood of more additions to come, City and their manager Pep Guardiola have shown their determination to bounce back.


  Liverpool will need Klopp’s renowned motivational skills to get them back in the saddle in the face of a stronger challenge from the Etihad Stadium. Much will again depend on their star names, but the squad depth could be tested and the likes of Naby Keita, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Takumi Minamino will need to step up.


  If City can resolve their defensive weakness, and keep Kevin De Bruyne, Raheem Sterling and Sergio Aguero firing, they will again take some stopping.


  No bookmaker can see beyond a two-horse race for the title, but others will hope to force their way into the reckoning.

  Manchester United showed great improvement in the second half of last season following the signing of Bruno Fernandes and grabbed third place.


  They will look to push on under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Chelsea have a good platform after finishing fourth and reaching the FA Cup final. In putting faith in youth, Frank Lampard has impressed as manager and, with their transfer ban now over, the signings of Hakim Ziyech and Timo Werner are exciting.


  Below them Leicester will hope to prove they have not missed their chance to break into the top four after surrendering seemingly-certain Champions League qualification after lockdown.


  Among the chasing pack Wolves and Everton have potential, while FA Cup winners Arsenal and Tottenham will expect to climb again as respective managers Mikel Arteta and Jose Mourinho begin their first full seasons in charge.

  Plenty of excitement surrounds the long-awaited return of Leeds to the top flight after a 16-year absence. The Yorkshire club will look to consolidate but, under the shrewd guidance of Marcelo Bielsa, there will be hope of emulating Sheffield United’s impressive first season back in the big time.


  The Blades themselves may find it tough to match last term’s heroics but Aston Villa, after their final-day survival avoided the need to break up the team, will hope to build.


  Survival will be the chief aim for promoted West Brom and Fulham, while Newcastle, with their long-touted takeover still having not materialised, could again find themselves looking down rather than up.

A federal grand jury returned a four-count indictment Wednesday against 21-year-old Dzenan Camovic for a knife attack on NYPD officers during a protest on June 3 in Brooklyn, an attack that prosecutors describe as ISIS inspired.
 Prosecutors allege Camovic, a Bosnian national, was living in Brooklyn illegally when he approached two uniformed NYPD officers on the night of June 3 and stabbed one of them in the neck with a knife. According to the indictment, Camovic then chased the second officer, "repeatedly and violently stabbing at the officer with the knife and eventually throwing the knife at the officer."
 Camovic then allegedly returned to the first officer, stabbing him again and robbing him of his gun, according to the indictment. Prosecutors say Camovic used the officer's 9mm caliber weapon to fire multiple shots at several officers.
