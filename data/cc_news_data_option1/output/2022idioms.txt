 So it is today, with the horrific COVID-19 killer both ravaging the globe and intensifying the inequality that was already rending social unity.

The Ferrari of Brooks (4) leads Masten Gregory's Cooper en route to victory at the 1959 German Grand Prix at the Avus circuit
 Mercifully, a move to Vanwall for 1957 was to prove a huge step forward, delivering a maiden World Championship podium first time out at Monaco, before he claimed his first official F1 win at the British Grand Prix, albeit in a shared effort with fellow Briton Moss. It was also the first time a British team had won a World Championship race - and on home soil to boot.
 Shared wins are rare things in F1 terms - this was only the third and final time in would ever happen - but it was a welcome one for both men and no source of regret that the glory and points were shared.
 For Brooks - replaced by Moss after 26 laps after his own car hit trouble - it was a blessing in disguise. He was racing on despite still nursing several injuries - among them "a hole in my thigh as big as a tennis ball" - after a big accident at the 24 Hours of Le Mans just weeks earlier.
 "We decided to pull in poor Tony because he was still suffering from a shunt at Le Mans and was not in good shape at all. He was out on track and he saw that I had retired and was really relieved to give his car to me," Moss would say in an interview years later. __
 "Sharing it with Tony Brooks, who was such a fantastic driver anyway, certainly didn't take anything away from it."

It is unclear how soon results from the testing will begin rolling in, ‚Äúbut we will be watching for them over the holiday weekend so we can get started calling the individuals who got tested and inform them of their results. We will be calling everyone, even those whose results are negative,‚Äù said Monongalia County Health Department Public Information Officer Mary Wade Triplett.
 Officials in nearby Harrison County will be watching, as well.
 Harrison-Clarksburg Health Department Administrator Chad Bundy said the three counties are very interconnected, and the health departments work closely together. The Harrison-Clarksburg department is learning from other counties as it prepares for its own community testing in the future.
 ‚ÄúWe have expectations to do community testing,‚Äù Bundy said. ‚ÄúThat should be coming in the very near future. I‚Äôve been having discussions with the DHHR and Bureau for Public Health on that, and we have been identified to do that.‚Äù
 Bundy said he expects to see another surge in new cases in the county as businesses open and as testing increases.
 The department had increased the hours of part-time staff to assist in epidemiological investigations, and it stands ready to do so again if required, he said.
 Although only time will tell, Bundy said he does not anticipate as much of an increase in cases in North Central West Virginia as the Eastern Panhandle is experiencing.
 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see. We‚Äôre not adjacent to those other states. We don‚Äôt have quite that community flow. Although we do have the I-79 Corridor coming from north to south in West Virginia, we don‚Äôt have the Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, Maryland, tie, and those people working in different states coming back and forth,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt expect to see quite that influx, although we do expect to see positive cases as we increase our testing.‚Äù
 Bundy said his understanding of the state‚Äôs new methodologies indicates that an increase of about 10-11 cases over a one-week period in Harrison County could trigger the state‚Äôs ‚Äúhigh-alert‚Äù response system, depending on whether the cases are linked to community spread or are an isolated outbreak event.
 ‚ÄúThere are many metrics they may be using, but one of them is ‚Ä¶ positive cases that have occurred in the last seven days,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOne of the figures that I had heard is an increase of 16-20 cases per 100,000 population in a county within the last seven days. That would be a metric where we‚Äôd definitely start looking at other metrics to determine whether they met those, as well.‚Äù
 A cluster of cases in a closed and isolated community, like in a nursing home, likely would not trigger the ‚Äúhigh-alert‚Äù status for an entire county, he said.

Though FHA and VA loans are insured by the federal government, Kan said private lenders that issue and manage the loans can still take a financial hit when they turn delinquent. That‚Äôs one reason they have added additional FICO and down-payment requirements.
 Tightening has also come to the less risky conforming market, in which lenders sell mortgages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-owned mortgage giants.
 JPMorgan Chase & Co., for example, said that except for one type of loan for low- and moderate-income households, the bank now requires a minimum FICO score of 700 and a minimum down payment of 20% on its purchase mortgages. The company declined to say what the minimums were before but acknowledged they‚Äôve been raised.
 Chase, along with Wells Fargo, has also stopped issuing new home equity lines of credit, or HELOCs. Such loans are essentially a second mortgage and allow homeowners to borrow against their equity a predetermined amount at their discretion. That could be an attractive option for someone in need of cash, but a risky bet for lenders if home prices plunge and the owner‚Äôs equity vanishes.
 Many experts aren‚Äôt yet forecasting a plunge in home values, though Zillow expects prices to drop about 2% to 3% before rebounding.
 ‚ÄúThe decision to temporarily suspend the origination of new HELOCs reflects careful consideration of current market conditions and the uncertainty around the timing and scope of the anticipated economic recovery,‚Äù Wells Fargo spokesman Tom Goyda said in an email.
 Laurie Goodman, vice president of housing finance policy with the Urban Institute, said the tightening of credit is concerning because people who are still employed and can afford payments might miss out on the ‚Äúsingle best way to build wealth‚Äù by buying a home.
 In addition to tighter FICO and other standards, Goodman has data showing that lenders are charging higher interest-rate premiums for people with lower credit scores.
 The Federal Housing Finance Agency, which overseas Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, has taken steps to try to keep mortgage credit flowing in the conforming market, for instance by allowing the two mortgage giants to buy some loans that are in forbearance.
 Kan, however, noted that some conforming lenders are still tightening requirements to reflect the economic conditions.
 Dave George, a Redfin agent in Orange County, California, said there is still demand to purchase homes, and by some indications it‚Äôs increasing. George said Redfin saw a jump in the number of in-person showings recently in Orange County, which are allowed with proper social distancing measures. At the same time, many of his clients are locked out because they need a low-documentation loan and can‚Äôt find one.
 ‚ÄúThey are on the shelf right now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt get the financing they need.‚Äù

Emmanuel agreed that a lot of people living with HIV in Nigeria were not aware of their status and that the country still had a long way to go as regards meeting the recommended number of HIV testing centres and counselling sites needed. He added that the HIV self-test had been identified as one that would contribute to the attainment of the UNAIDS global 95-95-95 goals. This implies that 95 per cent of people living with HIV should know their status, 95 per cent of people who know their status should access treatment, and 95 per cent of people on treatment should achieve suppressed viral loads.

It started happening once a week, Shaw said. And then, soon, it was a couple times a week. Mysterious things would trigger it; Linda Shaw said once, Bob saw a policeman and began crying.
 Seeing parents and children would trigger it; they reminded Shaw of the Long Binh ammunition dump in Vietnam, where he was assigned to the fire department. Shaw says one day, he and his team lit a controlled burn of an overgrown shrine near the berm, only to find after the blaze settled that two children ‚Äî a boy and a girl ‚Äî had been hiding inside, perhaps to steal ammo and sell it to the Viet Cong.
 ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt hear them scream or anything,‚Äù Shaw said. ‚ÄúThat still bothers me, when I see a parent hugging her kid.‚Äù
 Shaw eventually went to see a psychiatrist and got involved in a Black veterans‚Äô support group. As a group activity, they would sometimes volunteer at the St. Martin de Porres shelter. Many of the men there, who are over 50, were veterans like him.
 That‚Äôs how Shaw first got exposed to life in a shelter, 17 years ago. He‚Äôs been volunteering ever since.
 ‚ÄúI got to where I know just about everybody here, and they know me, and they‚Äôll talk to me,‚Äù Shaw said. ‚ÄúA veteran will talk to another veteran about problems, whereas they won‚Äôt just talk to anybody else. It makes me feel good to know that I can help somebody, and it helps with my post-traumatic stress.‚Äù
 Shaw‚Äôs been volunteering there longer than many of the staff, including the shelter‚Äôs director, Jennifer Newman.
 ‚ÄúThis is a part of him now,‚Äù Newman said.
 When Zafu Aragai, a Catholic Community Services‚Äô case manager, first met him on the second week of her job, she thought he was staff.
 ‚ÄúHe was very friendly and very outgoing and liked to greet everybody and know everybody,‚Äù Aragai said. When she had a problem procuring furniture for men moving off the streets, Shaw managed to get some from the base at Joint Base Lewis-McChord.
 Starting eight years ago, Shaw took it on himself to fix Thanksgiving dinner for the men in St. Martin de Porres shelter with the help of a few other volunteers, cooking 24 turkeys, a four-day undertaking each year. On Christmas, he makes the men shepherd‚Äôs pie.
 But as much as he helped before, when COVID-19 hit Shaw became indispensable, according to Newman. In mid-March, as it became increasingly evident that Seattle‚Äôs crowded shelters were susceptible to the spread of COVID-19, CCS staff at St. Martin de Porres were told by the county that they needed to move 100 men into new space on Airport Way.
 In 24 hours, Shaw and the staff moved 100 mats, 200 blankets, and set up everything needed to open a makeshift shelter.
 "Bob did all of those deliveries," Newman said. "We would not have been able to open that in the time frame that we did without his help.‚Äù
 At the beginning of April, Newman asked any volunteers who were still coming in to help from their homes instead.
 But Shaw insisted on staying.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had to talk to him more than once about maybe not coming in so much ‚Äî that the risk he‚Äôs putting himself in scares me, but he says this is where he wants to be, and he‚Äôs being careful, and he couldn‚Äôt imagine himself not being a part of it,‚Äù Newman said. ‚ÄúHe wears a mask everywhere, he washes his hands constantly, he even carries bleach in the vehicles to wipe the steering wheel down.‚Äù
 Shaw is mostly a delivery man now, picking up food every week at Food Lifeline, dropping off excess donations at other shelters, transporting documents for shelter-stayers, or whatever he‚Äôs needed for.
 But what Shaw realizes, more than anything, is that he needs this too.
 ‚ÄúI could have been where a lot of these guys are, here, right now. But I had people that believed in me, and just gave me encouragement,‚Äù Shaw said. ‚ÄúAnd I think I turned out pretty good.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike many of you, we were excited to get back outside,‚Äù Kari Dingman, assistant wildlife area manager for W.T. Wooten Wildlife Area, said in a release on March 14. ‚ÄúThousands of people headed outdoors this past week, and we have been pleased to see most people complying with the governor‚Äôs guidelines.
 ‚ÄúUnfortunately, we also observed some dangerous crowding and illegal camping on and near some WDFW-managed wildlife areas,‚Äù Dingman said. ‚ÄúIn the name of keeping both the public and our staff healthy, we hope this behavior can be curtailed with positive messaging and education. We want to do everything we can to keep state lands open.‚Äù
 Washington reopened state lands for day-use only on March 5. Overnight camping and visitor centers remain closed.
 Dingman listed guidelines to follow when recreating:
 Check what‚Äôs open. While many state-managed land destinations are open for day-use, other local, tribal, and federal land may still be closed.
 Opt for day trips close to home. Overnight stays are not permitted.
 Stay with immediate household members only. Recreation with those outside of your household creates new avenues for virus transmission.
 Come prepared. Visitors may find reduced or limited restroom services as staff begin the process to reopen facilities at wildlife areas and water access sites. You are advised to bring your own soap, water, hand sanitizer, and toilet paper, as well as a mask or bandana to cover your nose and mouth.
 Enjoy the outdoors when healthy. If you have symptoms of fever, coughing, or shortness of breath, save your outdoor adventure for another day.

 Arbie Glenn Miller Arbie Glenn Miller passed away in Seattle on Thursday, May 7, 2020 at age 88. Born July 31, 1931 in Idaho Falls, Idaho to Arbie Glenn Sr. and Genevieve Phelps Miller. Glenn grew up in St. Anthony, Idaho, attended the University of Idaho and received his dental degree from the University of Washington in 1957, after which he practiced dentistry for the next 56 years in Idaho, California, and Seattle. He married Sidney Eleanor Baldwin in St. Anthony on July 30th, 1955. They raised two sons, Michael and Dana, and two daughters, Brooke and Courtney. Glenn loved interacting with people. This is one of the reasons he so enjoyed his profession as a dentist. He was truly interested in people's stories, curious by nature, and a lifelong learner. He met each new acquaintance with an open heart and mind. Starting in 1957, he practiced dentistry with his father in St. Anthony who had been practicing there since 1916. Glenn also practiced in Tustin, California and Idaho Falls, Idaho. He retired from private practice in 1998, when he and Sidney moved to Seattle to be near their children and grandchildren. Between 2000 and 2013, he worked at Sea Mar Community Healthy Dental Clinic providing care for low income, underserved and uninsured populations where his experience in private practice proved to be of great value. Glenn's teaching and mentoring skills were very much appreciated by the University of Washington Dental School where he also volunteered during these years. Throughout his life Glenn was involved in service and social organizations such as Rotary, the Masonic Lodge and Beta Theta Pi fraternity. Through these organizations he maintained lifelong and meaningful friendships. He also was actively involved in reviewing new dental products, tools and materials for the Clinicians Report. Glenn was a devoted and loving husband, father, and grandfather. He provided his children with many opportunities for learning and instilled a love for outdoor adventure through skiing, hiking, camping, fly fishing and river rafting. He was also an avid golfer. His passion for the outdoors started with achieving the rank of Eagle Scout and climbing the Grand Teton in Wyoming. Later in life, he enjoyed views of the Olympics from West Seattle near his home. Glenn was preceded in death by his sister Marcile. He is survived by his wife Sidney, his four children, Michael Miller (Norma) of Boise, ID, Brooke Miller (Robin Graham) of Seattle, WA, Courtney Miller (Dan Trager) of Seattle, WA and Dana Miller (Amber Franklin) of Oxford, OH, and grandson, Christopher Miller and granddaughters Livia and Elena Trager. In addition to family, his smile, patience, and loving nature will be remembered by many. Glenn's family would like to thank his many caregivers over the past two years. In particular, we are grateful for the kindness of Eden Abebe and Curtis Wangigi, who took care of him at home. After moving to Aegis Living Ravenna, he was cared for by so many wonderful and caring people. At Glenn's request, a small family service will be held at a later date. Donations may be sent to the Sea Mar Community Health Center, the University of Washington Dental School, or a charitable cause of your choice. Sign Glenn's online Guest Book at www.Legacy.com

Every crisis has new heroes. During the 9/11 attacks, they were the first responders running into burning and crumbling buildings as others ran out. Now, during the coronavirus pandemic, the most visible heroes are the healthcare professionals, who are saving others and risking their own lives while doing so.
 These heroes have much in common with the people that we honor on Memorial Day ‚Äì America‚Äôs fallen veterans. They are men and women who have sacrificed their own lives so others could live. They are both elite and ordinary. They are elite in the sense of character. Giving your life so others could live is the ultimate definition of selfless.
 They are ordinary in the fact that they represent the diverse fabric of our country. They are rich and poor, black and white, male and female. They come from every ethnicity and background. In short, they looked like any one of us.
 As we celebrate the selfless and untiring performances of the healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, it brings to mind the military medics, doctors and nurses who sacrificed their lives while treating others on the battlefield.
 One such hero was Pharmacist Mate Third Class Jack Williams. The Navy Reserve corpsman was only 20 years old when he landed on Iwo Jima 75 years ago.
 On March 3, 1945, James Naughton, a Marine in Williams‚Äô unit, was wounded by a grenade. While under intense enemy fire, Williams dragged Naughton to a shallow depression and treated his wounds. Williams used his own body as a screen and was shot four times. Yet he continued.
 After he treated Naughton, Williams dressed his own wounds. He then proceeded to treat another Marine, despite his own immense pain. While heading to the rear, he was hit by a sniper‚Äôs bullet and killed. For his actions, Petty Officer Williams was awarded the Medal of Honor.
 We also remember Army veterans like Lieutenant Sharon Lane.
 According to her biographer, Philip Bigler, Lt. Lane threw herself into her work as a nurse. While serving in Colorado, she requested a transfer to Vietnam.
 ‚ÄúThere, at least, you are busy 12 hours a day, six or seven days a week,‚Äù she said in a 1968 letter to her parents.
 Her dedication was obvious, even as she treated enemy Viet Cong soldiers who would return the favor by kicking, cursing and spitting at their American captors.
 In the early morning of June 8, 1969, Sharon‚Äôs tour of duty ended. A Soviet- built rocket struck the hospital. Lieutenant Sharon A. Lane was killed in action at age 25.
 If she were still here, her skills as a nurse might still be benefiting us during the current crisis. But not all of the heroes working during the COVID-19 pandemic are in the healthcare industry. Grocers, first responders, delivery workers and drive-through restaurant employees are just a few of the many people that we rely on to provide vital services for society while risking their own safety.
 The military also has heroes in every occupational field. Truck drivers, cooks and administrative clerks have all paid the ultimate price. At sea, on land or in the air ‚Äî military service requires great risk.
 Roy Knight, Jr. was a pilot in the U.S. Air Force. On May 19, 1967, he was shot down while attacking a target on the Ho Chi Minh trail in Laos. He was posthumously promoted to colonel. Last year, a joint team from the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency discovered and later identified Col. Knight‚Äôs remains.
 When his remains arrived at Dallas‚Äôs Love Field, a crowd had gathered to witness the dignified transfer of the flag-draped casket from the Southwest Airlines jet into the receptive arms of the military honor guard. One observer reported that the entire crowd fell silent.
 The Southwest flight was piloted by another Air Force veteran, Col. Knight‚Äôs son, Bryan. Bryan Knight was only five-years-old when he said goodbye to his father as the elder Knight left for Vietnam.
 This is yet another legacy that these heroes leave behind. A legacy that includes their sons, daughters, grieving parents, grandparents and friends.
 Their heroic acts are sometimes performed to protect those with whom they serve. Corporal Jason Dunham was a squad leader with the Third Battalion, 7th Marines in Iraq.
 On April 14, 2004, his squad approached a Toyota Land Cruiser. After his squad discovered AK-47s in the vehicle, the enemy insurgent exited and engaged in hand-to-hand fighting with the unit. The driver dropped a grenade.
 To save his fellow Marines, Corporal Dunham made the ultimate sacrifice. He threw himself on the grenade and tried to use his helmet to shield the blast. Severely wounded by the grenade‚Äôs fragments, Cpl. Dunham was taken off life support eight days later.
 Corporal Dunham died so other Marines could live. He, too, was awarded the Medal of Honor for his gallantry.
 Approximately one million men and women of the U.S. military have lost their lives in defense of our nation since the founding of this great Republic.
 Not all have died from enemy fire. Some have died from diseases that have too often festered around war zones. Oftentimes, deaths from disease and accidents outnumbered casualties caused by enemy weapons.
 During the Spanish American War, 60 soldiers of the all-black 24th Infantry Regiment volunteered to serve as nurses. Thirty-six of them would later die of yellow fever or malaria.
 A generation later, the flu would kill nearly 16,000 U.S. soldiers in France during World War I. Another 30,000 American service members died in stateside camps. These men and women could have isolated safely in their homes. But they knew they had an important job to do. A mission to accomplish. They were all on a mission to serve.
 Even when the enemy is an invisible virus or a microscopic germ, the sacrifices made are just as meaningful. The U.S. military has already lost service members to COVID-19.
 This Memorial Day as we continue to honor those who fell for us in battle, let‚Äôs also pause to remember those who have also sacrificed their lives while serving others.
 May God bless them and may God bless you for remembering them.

Farrell visits Troy‚Äôs to buy seed potatoes, onions and soil amendments, and also to take in a little of McCourry‚Äôs wisdom.
 ‚ÄúAnd back in March he mentioned, ‚ÄòOh, be sure to look out for the week of May 6-13,‚Äô‚Äù she said.
 On McCourry‚Äôs word, Farrell held back on putting tender plants in the ground, but wondered if she‚Äôd made the right decision, especially with such a warm March.
 Even the National Weather Service‚Äôs 10-day forecast didn‚Äôt show a May freeze up until a few days before it hit, she said.
 But on May 10, freezing temperatures settled into the farm around 11 p.m., and didn‚Äôt let up for the next eight hours.
 COMFORT IN GENERAL WISDOM
 Thanks to McCourry, the farm was prepared, with double row covers over tender lettuces, potato plants safely buried in their hills and other tender plants practically rootbound but warm in the greenhouse.
 In part owing to bizarre microclimates in the region, not every farmer fared so well.
 Though temperatures at Open Ridge fell to 32 that night, a farmer just two miles away saw temperatures dip lower.
 ‚ÄúI asked around, and valley lows ranged that night anywhere from 24-32,‚Äù Farrell said. ‚ÄúSome had light frost, and another friend in her greenhouse just had one layer of plastic, and her tomatoes all got burnt.‚Äù
 Ferrell has farmed her land in the South Toe Valley since just 2012, and pays close attention to what her neighbors have to say about the weather, particularly those who‚Äôve been in the area for generations.
 ‚ÄúI always listen to what they say to us,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSome things are changing, of course, so there‚Äôs some sort of comfort knowing that certain rhythms in nature are still the same, that there is some wisdom still.‚Äù
 NEIGHBORS PULL TOGETHER TO HELP
 A 40-mile drive to the west, though a fraction of that distance as the crow flies, neighbors helped Anna and Paul Littman‚Äôs Ivy Creek Family Farm from freezing over, gathering more than 300 paper bags in four hours to cover tender tomatoes.
 Whitney Hibbits, a customer and friend, gathered about 90 bags in 40 minutes when the growers exhausted their initial supply and realized they were short.
 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs people like Whitney that enable farms to make it through tricky challenges like COVID-19 and multiple hard frosts in May,‚Äù Anna Littman said. ‚ÄúSo many other neighbors offered tarps, heaters, and really any help we could have dreamed of.‚Äù
 McCourry may lose sales when he warns customers not to plant so early, but he also puts people above his bottom line.
 He said the memory of his father, a minister for 66 years, and his mother, who always tried to help everyone, inspire him to do the right thing.
 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want people to get their stuff killed during this pandemic,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI want to help, which is why I‚Äôve kept my prices down about at wholesale.‚Äù
 McCourry, who sells seeds, flowers and vegetables including 48 varieties of heirloom tomatoes, might think about raising prices down the road. But not yet.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make it up somewhere,‚Äù he said.

Ms. Irvine and husband Stuart Anderson lived in two rooms at the Hotel Caledonia in downtown Seattle on the corner of Union Street and Seventh Avenue. Anderson owned the hotel and operated the Ringside Room, which later became the French Quarter.
 In 1964 the couple opened the first Black Angus Steakhouse, serving a full steak dinner for $2.95. Ms. Irvine made the tablecloths and the uniforms for the cocktail waitresses, and she helped to design the iconic square cow logo while also doing bookkeeping.
 Once, a cocktail waitress failed to show up for a shift and Ms. Irvine was right there, serving drinks.
 ‚ÄúShe was invested. She said Stu had a dream and she wanted to help him see that dream,‚Äù Butterfield says.
 In Anderson's 1997 memoir "Here's the Beef, My Story of Beef," there's a photo of Anderson and Ms. Irvine in full dinner dress, seated at a table with a white tablecloth, surrounded by cattle. The restaurant grew quickly, adding a dozen sites and kicking off a trend in Western-themed restaurants. The couple sold the chain to Saga in 1972.
 Anderson and Ms. Irvine were members at the Seattle Yacht Club, something Ms. Irvine fought to hold onto after their divorce in 1976.
 ‚ÄúOriginally they didn‚Äôt let women on their own be members, but she argued the point that she had just as much right to be a member as the men did. Then it became standard procedure,‚Äù Butterfield says.
 Ms. Irvine owned a 30-foot sailboat ‚Äî which she didn‚Äôt operate herself ‚Äî Butterfield‚Äôs father, Walter, often served as her captain. The Club was the site for Ms. Irvine‚Äôs 100th birthday party, where girlfriends told stories about kicking up their heels at Vito's in Capitol Hill with Ms. Irvine in the old days.
 Butterfield says although Ms. Irvine was legally blind and had suffered some memory issues toward the end of her life, she ‚Äúloved to be with people until the very end.‚Äù She enjoyed driving past houses she had lived in and going out to lunch, striking up conversations with everyone she met.
 ‚ÄúFor me, she‚Äôs just been the most special person in my life. Very generous, very loving,‚Äù Butterfield says.

The leaders of the coalition are trumpeting the importance of youth sports and sounding the alarm about the future of their organizations in correspondence with legislators in Washington. The fate of providers in low-income communities is of particular concern.
 Nearly 60% of local sports leaders expect to lose at least 50% of their revenue over the next year, according to an Aspen Institute for Sports online poll from April.
 ‚ÄúThis is an important issue," said Wayne Moss, the executive director of the National Council of Youth Sports. ‚ÄúIt's a timely issue, and young people right now are up against it in terms of the possibility of not being able to participate.‚Äù
 One of the objectives for the coalition is the creation of a loan program for youth sports organizations. Congress passed a $2.2 trillion virus relief package in March that included a Payroll Protection Program for small businesses, but it wasn't designed for youth sports organizations that rely more on volunteers and independent contractors.
 ‚ÄúHaving the calculation for relief being based on an employee basis just doesn't really get the kind of relief that these organizations need,‚Äù Lakowski said. She said such aid would be better based on gross receipts or operating loss.

Arbie Glenn Miller      Arbie Glenn Miller passed away in Seattle on Thursday, May 7,      2020 at age 88. Born July 31, 1931 in Idaho Falls, Idaho to Arbie Glenn Sr. and Genevieve Phelps Miller. Glenn grew up in St. Anthony, Idaho, attended the University of Idaho and received his dental degree from the University of Washington in 1957, after which he practiced dentistry for the next 56 years in Idaho, California, and Seattle. He married Sidney Eleanor Baldwin in St. Anthony on July 30th, 1955. They raised two sons, Michael and Dana, and two daughters, Brooke and Courtney.      Glenn loved interacting with people. This is one of the reasons he so enjoyed his profession as a dentist. He was truly interested in people's stories, curious by nature, and a lifelong learner. He met each new acquaintance with an open heart and mind. Starting in 1957, he practiced dentistry with his father in St. Anthony who had been practicing there since 1916. Glenn also practiced in Tustin, California and Idaho Falls, Idaho. He retired from private practice in 1998, when he and Sidney moved to Seattle to be near their children and grandchildren. Between 2000 and 2013, he worked at Sea Mar Community Healthy Dental Clinic providing care for low income, underserved and uninsured populations where his experience in private practice proved to be of great value. Glenn's teaching and mentoring skills were very much appreciated by the University of Washington Dental School where he also volunteered during these years.      Throughout his life Glenn was involved in service and social organizations such as Rotary, the Masonic Lodge and Beta Theta Pi fraternity. Through these organizations he maintained lifelong and meaningful friendships. He also was actively involved in reviewing new dental products, tools and materials for the Clinicians Report.      Glenn was a devoted and loving husband, father, and grandfather. He provided his children with many opportunities for learning and instilled a love for outdoor adventure through skiing, hiking, camping, fly fishing and river rafting. He was also an avid golfer. His passion for the outdoors started with achieving the rank of Eagle Scout and climbing the Grand Teton in Wyoming. Later in life, he enjoyed views of the Olympics from West Seattle near his home.      Glenn was preceded in death by his sister Marcile. He is survived by his wife Sidney, his four children, Michael Miller (Norma) of Boise, ID, Brooke Miller (Robin Graham) of Seattle, WA, Courtney Miller (Dan Trager) of Seattle, WA and Dana Miller (Amber Franklin) of Oxford, OH, and grandson, Christopher Miller and granddaughters Livia and Elena Trager. In addition to family, his smile, patience, and loving nature will be remembered by many.      Glenn's family would like to thank his many caregivers over the past two years. In particular, we are grateful for the kindness of Eden Abebe and Curtis Wangigi, who took care of him at home. After moving to Aegis Living Ravenna, he was cared for by so many wonderful and caring people.      At Glenn's request, a small family service will be held at a later date.      Donations may be sent to the Sea Mar Community Health Center, the University of Washington Dental School, or a charitable cause of your choice.

 Walter John Coyne, 77, of Naples, FL, died unexpectedly on Wednesday, May 13, 2020.
 He was born on February 17, 1943 in Acushnet, MA, the son of John Matthew Coyne and Rachel (Benoit) Coyne Roy. He enjoyed an idyllic childhood in Fairhaven, MA, where many of his famous stories originated. He knew everyone in town, the result of delivering papers and groceries as a teenager. In later years, he would amaze his friends with the way he still remembered their addresses and phone numbers from over fifty years ago.
 Walter graduated from Fairhaven High School, then received his degree in textiles from Southeastern Massachusetts Technological Institute in 1965. His career in textile sales began in Manhattan, then took him to Providence, RI in 1976. He moved his family to Rochester, MA, then ultimately settled in Westport, MA in 1978, where he lived until he moved to Winston-Salem, NC in 1990.
 After a variety of textiles sales jobs over the years, he eventually started his own business importing rubber thread from Malaysia and Thailand. As his corporation expanded, so did his opportunities to travel to Asia and form many friendships. He retired in 2012 and his company continues through his son. He and Jacquie finally settled in Naples, FL in 2015.
 Walter's gift of gab and Irish humor were engaging to everyone who met him. He had a heart of gold and loved to help others. He was a man who lived his faith, as witnessed in his generosity, kind-heartedness, and devotion to his wife of fifty-four years. His family will always cherish his quick-wit, sarcasm, and treasured repetitive stories, many of which began with: \"Pretend like you haven't heard this before...\".
 His child-like antics left his children and grandchildren with many fun memories. He enjoyed sailing, cooking, travel, Irish pubs, dim sum, history, Jeopardy, bragging about his children and grandchildren, reading obituaries from his hometown, and sharing things with people that he thought they would find interesting. But most of all, he loved spending time with his family.
 Walter is survived by his wife, Jacqueline (Comeau) Coyne of Naples, FL, his daughter Loreen Wright and her husband, Alex, of Peachtree Corners, GA, his daughter, Erin Coyne, of Winston-Salem, NC, and son, John Coyne and his wife, Isabel, of Greensboro, NC, and his grandchildren, Andrew, Colin, Michael, Fen, and Morgan; his sister, Gabrielle Giblin, of Wareham, MA, and his brother, Edward Coyne and his wife, Rita, of Richmond, VA; along with many beloved in- laws, nieces, nephews, and cousins.
 The family will hold a small, private funeral Mass at St. Agnes Catholic Church in Naples, FL, officiated by his close friend, Fr. Frank O'Rourke, then he will be laid to rest at Riverside Cemetery in Fairhaven, MA at a date to be determined. They ask that those of you who knew Walter raise a glass of Dewars in his honor from wherever you are in the world. Donations in Walter's honor may be made to the St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital.

The year 1918 is memorable not just for influenza but because it was also the last year of the ‚ÄúGreat War.‚Äù Our nation faced two grave concerns: the safety of the soldiers still fighting in Europe and the incidence of one of the worst pandemics in history. Although the influenza is called The Spanish Flu, there is no evidence that it originated in Spain. Because Spain was not under censorship controls at the time, it was free to publish accounts of the frightening epidemic. World leaders of combatant countries didn‚Äôt want the public‚Äôs fear of infection to affect support for the war effort, so they suppressed coverage of influenza.
 The news of the flu came from Spain, but not the virus. Spanish flu was not its only descriptor; it was often called by the French word ‚ÄúLa Grippe.‚Äù
 Appearing first in the spring of 1918, the flu was early on considered non- lethal and was even called the ‚Äúthree-day flu‚Äù in the battlefields of Europe.
 Flu victims were few in the summer and publicity was minimal. In April there was a first wave ‚Äî a report of 18 severe cases of influenza and three deaths in Haskell, Kan.
 In the autumn the flu re-emerged. Military posts were especially vulnerable and in September, a soldier from Camp Devens in Massachusetts was sent to the hospital. The next day, more than a dozen more were hospitalized, and at its worst point, 1,543 soldiers at Devens alone were diagnosed with the flu in a single day. Devens was a short distance from Boston, and from there the flu spread to other major cities in the East.
 The flu had returned with a vengeance.
 ‚ÄúNo Cause for Alarm‚Äù was the heading of a Walla Walla Bulletin article of Sept. 29, 1918. The newspaper stated the ‚ÄúSpanish Influenza in a modified form has made its appearance in Walla Walla.‚Äù Readers were urged not to panic.
 There was still a distinction, the article said, between the ‚ÄúWalla Walla Grippe‚Äù and the current influenza, but they were similar enough that city health officer Dr. Vanderpool encouraged anyone with flulike symptoms of sore throat, chills and fever to seek the attention of a doctor.
 Was there a remedy for this flu? Hand-washing was recommended, as was porridge, irrigating the nose with salt water and avoiding wearing mufflers.

The French government is strongly discouraging citizens from taking foreign holidays this summer due to the coronavirus but people can already start booking vacations at home in France in July and August, the environment minister said on Sunday.
 Ecological Transition Minister Elisabeth Borne said new information about how France would continue easing its lockdown would be announced this coming week but emphasised that people could already start to make plans.
 "Everyone can begin to reserve their holidays. We will be announcing the new rules during the week," she told France Inter radio.
 After the initial easing on May 11 of France's lockdown to combat the coronavirus, the French can still only venture a maximum of 100 kilometres (60 miles) away from their homes.
 The government has set June 2 as the date when the next stage of the easing is to begin.
 "From now, we can start to reserve our holidays for the months of July and August. For June, things will be made clear during the week," she said.
 The government's decision to allow peak season domestic tourism -- including in France's overseas territories -- is a major boost to the embattled tourist industry.
 But Borne added foreign trips should not be on the cards for the French this year.
 "We are absolutely not suggesting that the French reserve their holidays abroad. This year, the idea is to holiday in France," she said.
 France's neighbours Italy and Spain have announced plans to reopen their borders and have indicated they are ready to welcome tourists from abroad.
 But travel to and from Britain is set to be complicated after London announced controversial plans to enforce quarantine for all travellers from abroad, with very few exceptions.
 The French interior ministry said Friday it regretted the British decision but was ready to take reciprocal measures when the move comes into force.
 The coronavirus epidemic is gradually becoming less intense in France but officials have warned that the danger is far from over.

Everyone makes mistakes, right?
 I‚Äôve had a little more time than usual this spring to walk slowly with my camera in the woods, and my focus has zoomed in on smaller and smaller things. Naturally, I‚Äôm not always great at identifying these overlooked underdogs correctly on the first try. Show me three giant white petals rising above three big green leaves, and I can recognize a trillium with a single glance, from 40 feet away. Show me the quarter-inch-tall, reproductive structure of a primitive plant, and that‚Äôs a different story.
 Early in April, while snow still covered more than half the ground, I started going for lunchtime walks to stretch my eyes as much as my legs. I‚Äôd been consoling myself about the lack of travel opportunities by deciding that the lockdown was as good excuse to finally explore more thoroughly around my own woodsy neighborhood. A patch of sunlight highlighted a mossy log ‚Äî wet and happy from moisture provided by the melting snow ‚Äî tucked into a little hollow near a hemlock tree.
 I‚Äôm a sucker for happy moss, so I knelt down with my camera on its macro setting to capture the shimmers and sparkles and found a tiny forest of translucent trunks topped by smooth, brown caps. An understory of tiny green leaves carpeted this magical fairy forest.
 Moss is a non-flowering plant that reproduces using spores. Those spores are born in capsules, perched atop stalks called setae, and that whole reproductive structure is called a sporophyte. These were the youngest sporophytes I‚Äôd ever seen, and they glowed so beautifully that I had to post them to social media. At first everyone commented about the beautiful moss, but then my friend Patrick Leacock, a brilliant mycologist, had a hunch, did some research, and changed his identification to leafy liverwort.
 Liverworts are another type of primitive plant. Like mosses, they reproduce using spores and absorb water directly into their leaves instead of transporting it through a vascular system. Mosses and liverworts both prefer moist habitats, and often can be found living side by side.
 I went back the next day and looked closer. Indeed, the green parts around the base of the translucent stalks had a vaguely scaled appearance ‚Äî a trademark of liverworts. Some larger types of liverworts look like lizard skin. In addition to the pattern of the leaves, I also discovered that a few of the dark capsules had ruptured along four seams and peeled open to release their spores. The cup-shaped capsules of mosses usually release spores through a lid, and then remain standing above the moss carpet.
 Although that mossy log has since dried out, I think about the liverworts who live there each time I zoom past, and am glad I took the time to look closer.
 About a month later, I spent an entire afternoon looking closely at spring wildflowers on the trail to St. Peter‚Äôs Dome. I‚Äôd been worried I was going to miss my favorite flowers, and instead found that I was on the early side for many. Trillium buds were tightly closed, and many plants were just a tightly furled spike of green.
 One slope in particular sticks out in my memory for having an absolute carpet of spring beauties each spring. But as I hiked past, all I saw were the pairs of narrow green leaves with reddish stems poking up through the thick carpet of last year‚Äôs maple leaves. Not a single delicate white flower with pink stripes on its five petals bloomed up at me.
 Finding microclimates is one of the joys of searching out spring ephemerals. It‚Äôs such a thrill to find that south-facing slope with the very first blossom when all else is still drab and brown. And it‚Äôs almost as exciting, weeks later, to stumble upon one final flower still blooming in the cool shade of a north-facing hollow. So, as I mentioned in last week‚Äôs article, I wasn‚Äôt surprised that this patch was so far behind, while others were in full swing. I snapped a quick photo for reference, and then focused my camera on more colorful things.
 Closer to home, I started noticing those same tiny pairs of leaves in new places. I‚Äôd never known that spring beauties grew there, or there, or there‚Ä¶ and then I found those same paired leaves sprouting from the landscaping rocks near my front door. Spring beauties require rich, loamy soils. Not rocky fill. Something wasn‚Äôt right.
 Suddenly, my thoughts fell into place and I gave a little exclamation of surprise and delight for figuring out this puzzle. Last fall had been a mast year ‚Äî a bumper crop of seeds and nuts ‚Äî for many species, including sugar maples. I dug around a bit and found maple seeds galore, sprouted and un- sprouted, some with their husk still clinging to a narrow pair of leaves. Of course. Spring beauties almost always grow among sugar maples on the richest sites, but sugar maples can survive in a broader spectrum of soil types, too. Now knowing that these were sugar maple babies, I was in awe of their abundance. Surely some will escape predation and become trees!
 So, yes, I make mistakes in identification. But I often remember what I learn from those mistakes a lot more fondly than uneventful identifications. Maybe I should go out and make some more!

Small cable operators plan to tell Congress that rising   costs, declining video margins, outdated legacy regs and "onerous"   new ones have driven many operators out of business.
 Among the problematic regs are those related to pole   attachments and rights of way that drive up costs and make broadband deployment   in rural areas more difficult.
 That is according to American Cable Association board member   Patricia Jo Boyers of Boycom Cablevision and her prepared testimony for a   Senate Commerce Committee hearing on the state or rural communications   scheduled for April 9.
 She says that smaller cable operators serving rural areas   need to continue to offer usage-based pricing and employ "reasonable   network management" to control subs who use "excessive amounts"   of bandwidth, and to be able to offer specialized or "managed"   services. Both of those practices are allowable under FCC network neutrality   rules, but have come under fire from activist groups.
 She also said another key is for the government not to   subsidize competitors, though it should allow smaller operators to compete for   subsidies in truly unserved areas. The Commission is migrating Universal   Service Fund for telecom in high-cost, hard to reach, mostly rural areas to a   reverse auction via the newly named Connect America Fund.
 "Third, all broadband providers, including   cable operators, should have a fair opportunity to access support when the   Commission holds reverse auctions," she says. Two other keys to the   Connect America Fund disbursement, she said, are that no support should go   where there are competitive providers and that the funds should be limited only   to that which is necessary to deliver the speed required by the commission,   which she says is 4 Mbps/12 Mbps.
