But antibiotics didn’t really stop the coughing, “and that’s when it got pretty dangerous.” Pneumonia had him firmly in its clutches.
 “I think that, especially in young adults and people my age, I just really think the flu is what we talk about a lot more, and there’s kind of this invincibility complex, that even if they did get pneumonia they wouldn’t take it seriously,” said Allen, who is at risk for pneumonia because he has asthma.
 “You don’t have to be asthmatic or elderly or a child for it to get as serious as it can get.”
 About 1 million adults in the United States are hospitalized with pneumonia every year, and 50,000 die from this infection of the lungs, according to the American Thoracic Society.
 Influenza and pneumonia often hit together during the flu season, though there is no “pneumonia season.”
 (EDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
 This flu season, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment has reported 15 deaths from the flu and 529 from pneumonia.
 The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services has reported 16 flu deaths and 511 deaths related to pneumonia.
 (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
 “If you look at pneumonia by itself, yes, it is a more serious diagnosis than, say for example, run-of-the-mill flu or cold or anything like that, because lots more … people get hospitalized with it, and a lot more people die from it,” said Raghavendra Adiga, an infectious disease specialist and chief medical officer at Liberty Hospital.
 “Pneumonia is a big killer among infections that are out there … and it’s the second most common reason to be in the hospital.”
 ‘DO I HAVE PNEUMONIA?’
 The death last month of ESPN college football reporter Edward Aschoff set off new anxiety about pneumonia. His social media followers were shocked when, at first, it seemed that pneumonia had killed him. He died on his 34th birthday.
 Aschoff didn’t know other health conditions were conspiring against him when he wondered aloud on social media how he got pneumonia.
 “Anyone ever had multifocal (bilateral) pneumonia in their early 30s as someone who never gets sick and has a very good immune system?” Aschoff tweeted on Dec. 5. “Asking for two friends … my lungs.”
 His tweets about pneumonia inspired his followers to share their own battle stories, one man tweeting that “pneumonia ain’t no joke. I had it for over a month in 2017. Got to a point where I was sure it was gonna kill me and I had to come to terms with my own mortality.”
 But after Aschoff died on Christmas Eve, his fiancee, Katy Berteau, tweeted that a rare immune system condition, called HLH, caused his death.
 She revealed that doctors found Stage 4 non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in his lungs after he died.
 They were planning to get married in April.
 “Both pneumonia and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma can trigger HLH in the body and that is seemingly what happened with Edward,” she wrote on social media. “All of this combined is what led to his very rapid decline those last few days, and ultimately his passing. …
 “I also wanted to provide this update because he would have wanted everyone to know that something way bigger than pneumonia took him down.”
 Anyone can get pneumonia. Half of all adults with a healthy immune system who are hospitalized for severe pneumonia in the United States are between the ages of 18 and 57, the Thoracic Society says.
 “While young healthy adults have less risk of pneumonia than the age extremes, it is always a threat,” the society says.
 But, “it is most serious for infants and young children, people older than age 65, and people with health problems or weakened immune systems,” says the Mayo Cilnic.
 People who have asthma like Allen are at risk, along with patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, heart failure and other health issues that compromise their immune system. Other at-risk groups include transplant patients and cancer patients who have had chemotherapy, Adiga said.
 And if you smoke, pneumonia’s got your number, too. “People who smoke are at much higher risk for having pneumonia than non-smokers,” said Adiga.
 DON’T IGNORE THE CHEST PAINS
 People might not know they have pneumonia because the symptoms, according to the Mayo Clinic, mimic symptoms of the flu or a cold, “but they last longer.” Even health professionals themselves have been known to miss the signs in their own bodies.
 Symptoms include chest pain when you breathe, a cough that hacks up phlegm, a fever and shortness of breath.
 “You can have fever with a lot of different things. You can have a cough with a lot of different things,” Adiga said. “But can you differentiate? Many times patients can’t make the differentiation between ‘do I have pneumonia, do I have just a cold, the flu?
 “But the thing you want to watch out for is being short of breath. ‘Am I getting short of breath not doing anything?’ Then they need to have it checked out.”
 Chest pains are another telltale sign.
 Unlike body aches associated with the flu, pneumonia can reveal itself in pain when you take a deep breath, Adiga said.
 If you feel that pain “in one area of your chest … that is not a guarantee that you have pneumonia but it needs to be checked out.”
 ‘PEOPLE SHOULD BE AWARE’
 Even though he was taking a Zithromax Z-Pak antibiotic, Allen had been coughing up rust-colored phlegm and feeling tightness in his chest.
 But then, at his Kansas City, Kansas, home one night after work he had an asthma attack in the bathtub “that was so bad I almost couldn’t get out. … I was so nervous especially with how fast and bad it got.”

Farmers alleged that crop insurance premiums are deducted from their loan amounts compulsorily, but they are never benefited from this.
 At the farmers’ grievances redress meeting held at the Collectorate here on Friday, they complained with Collector S.A.Raman that they had not benefited from the crop insurance.
 Vetrimani, a farmer, said, “whenever crop loans are taken from national or cooperative society banks, a certain sum is deducted from our loan amounts in the name of crop insurance. Bank officials say that its mandatory and they cannot opt out of it. Despite paying the premium, none of the farmers have benifitted. The insurance amount never reaches the farmer in case of crop loss or other reasons.”
 However, the district administration officials said under the Pradhan Manthri Crop Insurance scheme, in 2017-18, 8,608 farmers had taken insurance for ₹60.34 lakh and ₹1.88 crore had been disbursed as crop insurance. In 2018-19, 26,844 farmers took crop insurance for ₹1.26 crore and 7,140 farmers had benefited receiving the insurance amount to a tune of ₹ 6.61 crore.
 The farmers refused to accept the information and said that the PM scheme was different from the crop insurance deducted from their loans.
 The farmers also complained that chemical fertilizers were forced upon them when taking loans while most of them had moved to organic farming practices.

The state-ranked Midlothian Panthers tuned up for Friday's showdown with Red Oak with a pair of wins last week, beating Ennis and Corsicana.
 The Ennis Lions came into Midlothian for Friday night's game against the Panthers, riding high after beating Cleburne the previous Tuesday night with a gritty comeback in the second half. But the first-place Panthers took a 68-41 win to stay undefeated in District 14-5A.
 Ennis started the contest the same way they ended the game on Tuesday, with pin-point shooting and a smothering defense to take a 13-11 lead at the end of the first quarter.
 However, the end of the quarter was the worst thing that could have happened to the Lions, as Midlothian was able to regroup and overcome a slow start.
 From that point on, Midlothian came out and completely dominated the remainder of the game, for the most part, by out-scoring Ennis 57-28 over the last three quarters.
 Midlothian was led by Nyk Madison and Omari Bobbitt with 15 points each. Other outstanding players for Midlothian were Luke Reynolds with eight points, Paden Harris with seven points and Jackson Tollefsbol with six.
 Ennis was led by Loel Spencer and Dee Johnson with seven points each. Jarveon Williams and Jacolby Mays also pitched in with six points apiece.
 On Tuesday night, the Panthers (18-7, 5-0) scored the game's first seven points, jumped out to a 22-6 lead at Corsicana and rolled to a 63-30 victory. Madison, Bobbitt, Reynolds and Kelton Williams all scored 13 points to lead MHS.
 The Panthers will host Red Oak on Friday night at 8 p.m. in a game that will determine the driver's seat as the first half of district play ends. MHS is ranked No. 12 in Class 5A by the Texas Association of Basketball Coaches, and the Hawks (15-11, 5-0) are ranked No. 16.

A 59-year-old Three Forks man was charged with a second count of driving under the influence of alcohol when he appeared intoxicated in court on an initial appearance for another DUI.
 According to court records, the man appeared on the morning of Jan. 15 in Judge Bryan West’s courtroom at the Gallatin County Law & Justice Center. The court asked a sheriff’s deputy to come to the courtroom with a portable breath test machine. The man provided a breath sample, which measured .133 percent, and said he was surprised at the results. When asked, he told the deputy he had not had anything to drink that morning, though he said he had consumed five beers the night before. The deputy asked if he had driven to court that morning, and the man said he had not. The deputy could smell the odor of alcohol on the man’s breath.
 After Judge West heard the results of the breath test, he ordered the deputy to place the man in custody for contempt of court. As they were walking to the detention center, the deputy again asked him how he had come to the Law & Justice Center that morning. He said a friend had brought him, and when the deputy asked for the friend’s phone number so that she could verify his story, the man said the number was in his phone. The deputy gave the man the phone, after which she discovered he sent a message asking the intended recipient to “tell police you gave me a ride here.” The deputy confiscated the phone.

As Lehrer turned 75 in spring 2009, PBS announced that the show would be retitled as "PBS NewsHour" later in the year, with Lehrer pairing up on anchor duties with other show regulars.
 He said he approved of the changes, telling The New York Times that having a pair of anchors would "shake things up a bit," even as all sectors of the news business struggled to meet changing reader and viewer demands.
 Lehrer was born in Wichita, Kansas, in 1934, the son of parents who ran a bus line. In addition to titling his memoir "A Bus of My Own," he collected bus memorabilia — from station signs to a real 1946 Flxible Clipper bus.
 After graduation from college in 1956, he served three years in the Marines, later calling the experience so valuable that he thought all young people should take part in national service.
 "I had no close calls, no rendezvous with danger, no skirted destinies with death," he wrote. "What I had was a chance to discover and test myself, physically and emotionally and spiritually, in important, lasting ways."
 He went to work from 1959 to 1970 at The Dallas Morning News and the now- defunct Dallas Times-Herald. Lehrer jumped to television for a Dallas nightly newscast.
 Lehrer wrote that it was ironic that the Watergate hearings helped establish the importance of public TV, since President Richard Nixon hated public broadcasting. He also recalled that the lengthy hearings gave him the chance to practice his new craft, and MacNeil, already a veteran, gave him valuable pointers on how to speak on camera clearly and conversationally.
 He is survived by his wife, Kate; three daughters: Jamie, Lucy, and Amanda; and six grandchildren.

In water law, the most important thing is getting your water.
 Montana’s Senator Steve Daines has introduced the Montana Water Rights Protection Act (MWRPA) to provide federal settlement of the water rights claims of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes (CSKT). Without this legislation, Montana will face years of expensive litigation and uncertainty in trying to resolve these claims, and will assuredly reach a worse conclusion.
 This is due to the undeniable fact that in water law, a settlement allows you to structure protection for junior water rights in a way that a trial does not. And make no mistake, the junior water rights being protected by this settlement are the non-Tribal water rights. To put it in blunt terms, the non- Tribal farmers and ranchers, both on and off the Reservation, have the most to gain from this settlement, and the most to lose from litigation.

It was Meis’s interest in business and his work with the chamber of commerce that led him to the city council. Among his responsibilities for the chamber was to attend council meetings on a rotating basis as a liaison, and that piqued his interest in the workings of the town’s governing body. He decided to run for the Ward I vacancy after Koentopp announced she would not seek re- election to the seat she had held for 29 years.
 Despite his interest in fostering business development, Meis acknowledges that the amount of residential development occurring in the northwest part of the city that Ward I encompasses requires a considerable amount of his attention. He says he favors Belgrade employing a cautious approach when working to provide adequate services to support growth, while still remaining fiscally sound and having a plan to weather the next inevitable recession.
 “You want to do things at the speed of value,” he said. “We’ve got to be cautious while we’re expanding.”
 Meis notes that while Belgrade’s economy is anchored by three transportation pillars – Interstate 90, the railroad, and Montana’s busiest airport – the city could do a better job addressing other transportation needs such as improved traffic flows, walking/bike paths, and Streamline bus routes. He believes such improvements will build on efforts by the chamber of commerce, Belgrade Community Coalition and downtown business owners in fostering better connectivity and sense of community to Belgrade.
 Meis looks forward to working with city staffers, whom he describes as “top- notch,” as well as community leaders such as Chamber Director Kristi Gee and School Superintendent Godfrey Saunders, who signed a three-year contract to remain in his position last week.
 He says he faces “a learning curve” as he settles into office, but will lean on veteran fellow council members as he learns the ropes. He is looking forward to an upcoming council retreat to help orient him further, and will serve on the Council’s Disaster Emergency Service and Planning Coordinating committees.

Continuing rain in the Nilgiris triggered landslips and flooding of houses in many parts of the district on Friday.
 Officials said that Manjoor and Geddai were the most affected by the rain, where a few houses were reportedly damaged and rain water entered around 10 houses on Friday morning. No injuries or loss of life were reported.
 Officials said that an average of 53.61 mm rainfall was recorded till Thursday morning, with Kundah receiving 120 mm and Geddai 109 mm. Kinnakorai and Avalanche too received more than 90 mm rainfall.
 The intense rain triggered landslips in many areas, affecting traffic along the Udhagamandalam to Manjoor Road and Udhagamandalam-Coonoor-Mettupalayam Road.
 District Collector J. Innocent Divya told reporters here that the district administration had identified 283 landslip-prone areas in the district, and people living in those areas were asked to move to safer locations.
 ## Control rooms
 The district administration has also set up control rooms in all taluks where officials have been posted round the clock to keep tabs on any emerging situations and to effect contingency measures whenever necessary.
 Residents have been asked to contact the toll-free number 1077, to share information on rain or flood-related emergencies anywhere in the district. People have been told to be wary of rain-damaged trees, buildings and electric lines.
 Employees of the electricity board have been working on securing damaged power lines, and trimming branches of trees in danger of falling on power cables and electricity poles.
 Water was released from the Upper Bhavani Dam, which reached full capacity on Friday.
 As a result, people living along the banks of the river further downstream, especially Athikadavu and Pilloor, have been asked to move to higher ground.

Tirupati-bound Narayanadri Express starting from Lingampalli is now provided with Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches for jerk-free journey, enhanced safety and more speed, thereby reducing its running time. Ergonomically designed seats, large windows with good visibility, wider luggage racks, anti-skid PVC flooring and no visible screws in coach interiors are the other new features.
 SCR officials said the coaches have bio-toilets. In addition, AC coaches have been provided with in-built reading lamps, insulation against noise, automatic sliding doors and auto-closing vestibule door enhancing the travel experience.
 The LHB coaches are designed with anti-climbing structure and fire-retardant material for more safety and to reduce damage and impact on coach in case of any unusual occurrence. The train is being hauled by electric locomotive for the entire journey.
 “Earlier, due to non-electrified section between Pagidipalli-Guntur, the train was being hauled by diesel locomotive up to Guntur and from there it is being hauled by electric locomotive. Now, this section too has been electrified saving time by avoiding change of engine at Guntur and reducing running time by 20 minutes,” they explained.
 Introduction of electric engine and LHB coaches has helped in introducing Head On Generation (HOG)system for lighting and air-conditioning in coaches. HOG will also help in reduction of noise pollution and savings to railways to a tune of ₹6 crore per annum in terms of fuel consumption besides reduction of carbon footprints.
 General Manager Gajanan Mallya wanted more trains to be similarly in a gradual manner for providing eco-friendly travel.

Al Olszewski, a physician who is running for Governor, has attacked the MWPRA with a variety of false claims, in an apparently hopeless bid to keep alive the one issue which motivates his Gubernatorial campaign. The Doctor’s prescription is worse than the disease.
 First, Al is wrong that this bill grants off-Reservation rights to the CSKT across Western Montana. The bill actually requires the Tribes to give up over 97% of their off-Reservation claims, and almost all of the remaining claims are co-owned by the State. Without the Daines legislation, irrigators across Western Montana will be forced to go back through the (already decades overdue) Water Court adjudication, pay their water lawyers again, and risk losing priority to a Tribal water right that the CSKT had already agreed to dismiss.
 The second false attack is that this law takes away over 36,000 acres of State Land within the Reservation. No, the federal settlement allows the exchange of 36,808 acres that are currently in a scattered patchwork across the Reservation, to be exchanged for an equivalent acreage of Federal land outside the Reservation. The exchange only proceeds if the Montana Land Board approves it, just like it does for every land banking exchange.
 Think about the benefits of this exchange. Montana could give up scattered and already-logged lands across the Reservation in order to gain consolidated timbered Federal lands to add to its forestry program. My home town of Townsend just saw the temporary closure of RY Timber because we can’t get enough timber off federal lands. We would love to see the addition of 36,000 acres of forest land into the State Land Trust, where we know we can get a timber sale and bring back some jobs.
 Dr. Al has more false attacks on the MWRPA, which are all incorrect, and which you can see for yourselves if you contact Senator Daines’ office. But let me leave you with what this settlement actually accomplishes.

So it was a dream come true to finally get out there, but at the end of the day I did want to win, so we've got to look to the next game.”

The steps taken by China to shut down cities with more than 18 million people are unprecedented in public health, as countries typically shy away from such extreme measures. Tedros said that while WHO's role is to provide science- based recommendations, "at the end of the day, a sovereign country has the autonomy to do what it thinks is right."
