However, his decision to move to England in January of that year, ostensibly with a view to getting higher quality minutes and fitness under his belt, backfired spectacularly when, following a gruelling half-season with Middlesbrough, he turned up to Egypt completely shot physically and could only feature in two of Nigeria’s seven matches.

"The bottom line is that the minister's decision is contrary to evidence submitted by biologists that sea lice from fish farms threaten the survival of wild salmon, and is contrary to the concerns of First Nations over the chemicals used to treat sea lice in fish farms and the turbulent waters in the Discovery Islands area that could spread sea lice for miles," UBCIC president, Grand Chief Stewart Phillip. "How can the failure to implement the Cohen Commission's recommendation be justified when the DFO did not even test for sea lice in its assessments of various pathogens and diseases found on fish farms? How can the DFO justify its actions when the livelihoods, cultures, and rights of Indigenous peoples are a stake?"

Nobody wants to lose in any jersey, of course, but the Lakers would feel like they're letting Bryant down if they happened to fall short in that uniform. The tribute jersey is just one of many ways that Bryant's fingerprints are all over these NBA Finals between the Lakers and Miami Heat. It's the league's first title series since Bryant, his daughter Gianna and seven others were killed in a helicopter crash on Jan. 26.

We'd been dating for over two years, much closer to three. K and I met online, in a forum where the coding-challenged could get an assist. He was a Chicago native starting out as a developer, and we gently flirted while he helped me with a fledgling recipe blog. He wasn't single, so we stayed "friends." I told him about men who came and went: a Malaysian I regret introducing to my family, an Englishman who called me 50 times in a single day after we'd broken up, an American narcissist who gaslit me for amusement. K patiently listened to all of it, until one day out of the blue, he told me he loved me. "I always have, but especially now," he said.

"You have to be able to change various snap counts, vary audibles and that's stuff that we've always done but you just have to pay attention and really go into the details. At the end of the day you just got to go out there and play the football that you've always played."

South Carolina's The State quotes Malloy as saying, "I would say the president is truly on the ropes right now…. Lindsey Graham is being challenged like he's never been before, which means he's not terribly popular. Lindsey Graham is close to the president. He speaks to the president often; so, it's probably no coincidence that both of them simultaneously have lost enough ground to be challenged."

I put down roots and started a job that, while it perfectly matches my skill set, I've never actually done. It's a 9 to 5 position, something I've never taken on before, that mixes creative inclination with a heavy dose of logistical consideration and people skills. After 12 years of writing professionally, I'd begun to feel suffocated, and I wanted so badly to tear down the walls around me. So I dove into something completely unfamiliar, and I've been caught in this exciting process of learning and failing and being corrected and being entirely new. It makes me come alive, seeing what else I can do and what other paths might open up for me. More than anything, it just feels good to do something different and challenging just for me, to be tethered to something other than a man.

"articleBody" : "Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers have been the pillars of Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) for nine years now. De Villiers moved from Delhi Daredevils (now Delhi Capitals) to RCB in 2011 and in no time, the two struck a great partnership, both on and off the field.The two have led RCB to two IPL finals over the last nine years, but have failed to win the trophy.In the ongoing IPL 2020, de Villiers as of now is the top-scorer from the RCB camp, having scored 134 runs in three innings. While Kohli has failed to get going as he has scored a mere 18 runs in three matches.Ahead of RCB's next IPL 2020 match, which is against Rajasthan Royals (RR) on Saturday, Kohli took to social media to express his love and respect for de Villiers.'The most special thing about sport is the friendship and mutual respect you share with your teammates along your journey. Sport is beautiful,' wrote Kohli with an adorable photo of the two top players, who have become best of friends off the field. Kohli and de Villiers have together put up 2,883 runs for RCB in 613 innings at an average of 43.7 in the last nine years, including ten 50-run stands and nine 100-run stands. Out of the 2,883 runs, Kohli has contributed 1,390 and de Villiers 1,406. Kohli and de Villiers' highest partnership was 229 runs, which the two had shared for the second wicket against Gujarat Lions in IPL 2016.The RCB pair, who is close to putting up 3,000 runs for RCB, also holds the record for the highest partnership in the IPL. The next in the list is Kohli-Chris Gayle (2,787 runs), also of RCB with their highest stand being an unbeaten 204 for the second wicket against Delhi in IPL 2012 ahead of the Sunrisers Hyderabad duo of David Warner-Shikhar Dhawan (2,357 runs). Dhawan, however, now has moved from SRH to Delhi Capitals.In the ongoing IPL 2020, RCB has won two out of their three matches. Their recent game, which was against defending champions Mumbai Indians, was a close encounter. The scores tied, forcing a Super Over before Kohli and de Villiers finished the job for RCB.",

"There were a lot of women that were nominated for this award," Akins said. "It's an honor to be the women from Penn and to be the one remaining for the Ivy League. It's just an incredible honor especially now. I've had some impact on people's lives at Penn. I think right now that means a lot more considering the circumstances that I graduated [with the pandemic]. I'm really appreciative of the people I'm surrounded by at Penn."
 Akins was the top seed in the 800 meters heading into the NCAA Indoor Track & Field Championships in March before the NCAA canceled all of its winter and spring championship events due to COVID-19. She was named a United States track and Field Cross County Coaches Association All-American and was named the Outstanding Track Performer after winning 1,000 and mile to lead the Quakers to their third consecutive team championship at the Ivy Heptagonal Indoor Championships in February. She was a Bowerman Award finalist finalist, a USTFCCCA National Athlete of the Year finalist, and the USTFCCCA's Mid- Atlantic Athlete of the Year for the indoor season.
 "It's exciting to hear that Nia has been recognized among the top 30 in the NCAA Women of the Year voting," said Steve Dolan, the James P. Tuppeny/Betty J. Constanza Director of Track and Field/Cross Country in a statement. "I am so proud of her! As one of the most accomplished student-athletes in Penn history she is certainly very deserving of this honor. Her hard work and success on and off the track are amazing and inspiring to all."
 Akins, a cum laude graduate of Penn's School of Nursing, was a USTFCCA All- Academic selection throughout her career. She was presented with the Jeanne Francis Hopkins Graduate Award, which is given to a nursing undergraduate or graduate student who has earned academic excellence while embarking on a Penn curricular opportunity.
 Akins, who grew up in San Diego, Calif., wanted to go to Penn's nursing school and compete in cross country and track and field with the Quakers. She was able to accomplish both goals.
 "I was looking at nursing schools," Akins said. "I knew I wanted to be a nurse very early. Penn had the No. 1 nursing school at the time. I came to visit and met the team. I knew this is the place I wanted to be. The best of both worlds."
 Akins signed a professional contract with Brooks Beats Track Club in Seattle where she is training for the Olympics.
 The selection committee will narrow the competition down to nine finalists by mid-October. The organization will choose three women from each NCAA division. After that, the NCAA Committee on Women's Athletics will name the NCAA Woman of the Year.
 "When the news broke for the top 30," Akins said. "I was just kind of looking at the other women. They're all so cool. They've accomplished so much. It's just an honor to be along side of them. It's very surreal."

So, like any good Catholic would, I phoned a friend. And by friend, I mean priest. I joined my mom for a lunch with one of her many priest friends (#JustCatholicTitaThings). "So, Father Genny, my boyfriend isn't exactly Catholic. Would he have to convert for us to have any sort of future together?" This was what I'd planned to say, but what burst out of me instead was full-blown word vomit: What if we get married? Wouldn't we have to marry in a church? He'd get bored during the ceremony and I don't want him BORED at our wedding. What about our future kids? Would they be Catholics? Oh God, what if we live a long and happy life together but I end up not seeing him in heaven (bold of me to assume I would end up there in the first place)?! And wise old Obi-Wan Genny just said, "Is he a good person? Kind?" I nodded. Then he shrugged. "Well, then, what makes you think he won't end up in heaven? If he's a good guy, that's all that matters." Just like that. I suppose it was rather on-brand for me, that it took God (or at least, one of his representatives) to make me see what was right in front of me all along.

The new Quinnipiac poll showing Biden trailing Trump by only 1% in South Carolina might be the former vice president's best so far in that state, although Biden's performance in other recent polls has been decent in light of how deeply Republican South Carolina is. Polls released during the second half of September found Trump ahead of Biden in South Carolina by 4% (Data for Progress) or 6% (Morning Consult). Considering Trump's 14% victory in South Carolina in 2016, it's easy to make an argument that he is underperforming there — even if he ultimately wins the state again.

Of course, as fate (or God, I suppose, in this case) would have it, for the last three years, the person I've been in a committed relationship with is decidedly not the nice Catholic boy I dreamed of. On paper, he's technically a baptized member of the Protestant Church in the Netherlands. But his relationship with that Church began and ended at his baptism. It's not that he was a hardcore atheist, exactly. He believes in a God, just not in any kind of structured religion. His barkada consisted of lapsed Catholics and agnostics, in stark contrast to my cadre of girlfriends, who were basically a bunch of Auntie Julies in the making. I hesitantly asked him if he believed in Jesus, and he answered with a timid "Sure," nothing like the resounding "Yes!" I would have given. As the years passed, it just became something we swept under the rug. After all, it's not like it really mattered.
