The move late on Wednesday marked the latest by the leading social network seeking to curb misinformation while seeking to steer clear of political involvement.The messages, which remained visible in the Facebook ad library, said Biden was “dangerous for America” and claimed the Democrat would allow a “surge” in immigration, suggesting this could increase coronavirus and security risks.
 “We rejected these ads because we don’t allow claims that people’s physical safety, health, or survival is threatened by people on the basis of their national origin or immigration status,” Facebook said in a statement.
 The ad rejection underscored the challenge for social platforms seeking to sift through mountains of false claims during a heated election campaign, many of which come from Trump.
 Facebook earlier this year removed a Trump ad which contained a symbol used in Nazi Germany to designate political prisoners.
 Separately, Facebook also said it was clarifying its rules on ads seeking to question the legitimacy of the electoral process amid the latest Trump comments suggesting he may not trust the ballot count.
 “In addition to banning ads that make premature declarations of victory, we also won’t allow ads with content that seeks to delegitimize the outcome of the US election,” Facebook product manager Rob Leathern said.
 “This would include calling a method of voting inherently fraudulent or corrupt, or using isolated incidents of voter fraud to delegitimize the result of an election.”
 Facebook is also changing its policies to prevent ads that delegitimize election results, project manager Rob Leathern tweeted on Wednesday. Under the new policies, ads cannot prematurely declare victory, present any method of voting as fraudulent or corrupt, or make accusations of voter fraud. The changes to these policies apply to both Instagram and Facebook and apply immediately as of Wednesday, he said.
 Following the removal of the ad on Wednesday, Courtney Parella of the Trump campaign doubled down on the advertisement’s claims in a statement. She did not cite the source of the 700% figure featured in the ad.
 “While President Trump took decisive action to restrict travel from China to slow the spread of coronavirus and saved countless lives, Joe Biden was busy calling the president xenophobic and armchair quarterbacking his pandemic response,” she said.
 The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Although Facebook removed the ads regarding refugees and Covid-19, other misleading advertisements remain on the platform. One ad shows Joe Biden with a headphone photoshopped to his ear, perpetuating the false claim that the presidential candidate somehow cheated in the debates.
 The advertisement appears to have been launched on the day of the debate but remains active on the platform, with more than 800 versions still active. The ads have been viewed by more than 3.6 million people, the majority of whom are in the key election states of Florida and Pennsylvania, according to Facebook data.
 The Trump campaign’s ads have led to the “earpiece” conspiracy theory spreading organically on other social media platforms, including TikTok, according to the watchdog group Media Matters. The group has found four examples of TikTok videos espousing the theory that have been viewed more than 560,000 times. A spokesperson for TikTok said the videos violate its policies on disinformation and it is working to remove them as they are posted.

Produced by Rossi, Magini, Anita Maiezza and Anthony Calabrese who wrote the script, the movie blessed with a few “gets” that Rossi says lend authenticity to the film. “Shooting at the church was a big get,” the Laval resident told The Suburban, about an important scene in Little Italy’s Notre dame de-la- defense (La Difesa), with the requisite shot of the church’s iconic Benito Mussolini fresco. “We filmed most of it in 2019 and figured we’d do some of the small inserts in 2020, well then COVID hit and religious institutions were shut down. It took a lot to get back in and get that shot, but it was so important to the story, so we waited.”
 Scored by Laval musician Charles Vaccaro and featuring an appearance by Dayle Hayes, savvy viewers will spot interiors of a Saint-Léonard triplex, along with other iconic spots including Ahuntsic’s Bistro Charland, where Cannistraro introduces Montreal funny man Guido Grasso to the business end of a ball peen hammer.
 It’s no easy feat to produce and promote a short film when people are not going out, and festivals are virtual he says, but credits his three partners and particularly Maiezza for “getting the film out there. She is all that” he laughs, “but we work great as a team. Everyone pulls their weight.”
 Magini and Rossi have been making short films together for years. Rossi growing up in Ahuntsic, Magini in Laval, and now the two have swapped locales as adults. Their films, often filled with tension and redemption in their short unravelling, have attracted great attention, using renowned local artists and stories that resonate, often on a shoestring. “We’re a four-person team,” he says. “We've been doing this for years and we've definitely had some success with our shorts.”
 Their last film, Thespian, featuring Ellen David, is still running in festivals and picked up kudos at the Lake Placid Film Festival last year. As for Night Shift, he says it was a lot of fun to create but remains mum on the cost: “Cheaper than Hollywood” he laughs, but a real labour of love; We made this film for the cost of a couple of sausage sandwiches!”

The Laval Rocket added to their roster of forwards to look at for the coming campaign, which will start no earlier than December, with the signing of Brent Gates Jr. to a one-year two-way AHL contract. Gates, a centre, heads east after logging games with the AHL’s San Diego Gulls and the ECHL’s Tulsa Oilers. Standing at 6’02’’ and weighing in at 201 lbs, Gates appeared in 20 games with the Gulls where he had four goals and a helper. In 25 games with Tulsa, the Grand Rapids, Michigan native notched 10 goals and 10 assists for 20 points. Before turning pro, Gates played four seasons with Minnesota University in the NCAA. In 148 games with Minnesota, the left-handed registered 42 goals and 43 assists while also serving 61 penalty minutes and posting a +14 differential. Gates path in elite hockey started as a member of the Compuware U16 team in Michigan. At his first USA Hockey Select 16 camp in July of the 2012-13 season Gates was selected to play for the USA U17 team at the Five Nations Tournament in Slovakia. The following year he found himself on the roster of the USA U17 squad taking part in the Five Nations Tournament where Team USA won gold, then earned a spot on the Green Bay Gamblers of the USHL. Gates played for the USA U18 team at the 2014 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament before returning to Green Bay for his second USHL season. Ranked 105th amongst North American skaters in the Central Scouting Bureau’s final rankings, he was selected by Anaheim in the third round (80th overall) in the 2015 NHL Draft. Gates has athletic genes in his DNA as his father Brent Gates Sr. played seven seasons in Major League Baseball, all in the American League. Gates Senior was an infielder who spent four years with the Oakland Athletics, two with the Minnesota Twins and one campaign with the Seattle Mariners.

Living Proof Recovery Executive Director Catherine Lovvorn has risen in her place in the center -- going from a person seeking treatment in 2016 to her new position running it.
 "It's going wonderful so far," Lovvorn said. "Sometimes I feel like I have big shoes to fill."
 When the former executive director and founder, Claudia Hamilton, announced she was leaving in June, Lovvorn submitted her application to the board, hoping to be considered for the position.
 At the time, she was the programming director for the center. She had many talks with Hamilton and they went before the board together when it came time to vote.
 When the board approved the decision, Lovvorn was ecstatic and it was a true recognition of her hard work.
 "(Hamilton) grew a leader and I want to grow other leaders myself," she said.
 Living Proof is known for its multiple addiction recovery programs and its partnerships with Floyd Medical Center and in-patient treatment centers, such as Highland Rivers Health.
 Patrons have the option of several different recovery paths, such as in- patient treatment, out-patient treatment, wellness and fitness treatment and medically-assisted treatment.
 The center also offers childcare for people coming into meetings and counseling sessions, something Lovvorn was very grateful for when she came for help.
 They reopened their doors to the public in June and started hosting socially distanced in-person counseling sessions and group therapy. They also bring in a personal trainer during the week and offer CrossFit classes on Sunday as part of their wellness recovery program.
 "We really couldn't do this without the community support," Lovvorn said.
 As a thank you, Lovvorn invites everyone in the community to a Trunk-or-Treat event on Halloween at Living Proof Recovery Center, 408 Shorter Ave., from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. The event will include a bounce house and a costume contest.

Myanmar: Ann Township On Edge After Two Corpses Found With Hands Tied - Eurasia Review

If you're wondering about the fate of winter-season high school sports tournaments, you're not alone.
 Dan Buron is curious, too.
 That's because he's the Bridgewater-Raynham High athletic director and he's got some scheduling issues he needs to work out.
 Thursday's MIAA Tournament Management Committee virtual meeting was mostly devoted to approving the alignment mechanisms for four sports -- cross country, indoor track, golf and boys hockey -- for the switch to statewide tournaments beginning in the 2021-22 school year.
 There was time at the end, however, for the 16 voting members to discuss plans for the winter. That season, which is supposed to start on Nov. 30, according to the MIAA's new "four-season" plan, is shrouded in mystery right now as the state association awaits updated COVID-19 health guidelines from the state. Earlier this week, the MIAA Board of Directors was told that those new guidelines are not expected until the first week of November.
 That uncertainty led Buron on Thursday to pose a simple question -- Should he schedule regular-season competition right up until the end of the winter season (Feb. 21) or should he block out time at the end of the window to allow for playoffs?
 The answer, of course, is that no one knows yet. But the TMC members agree that answers need to come soon because winter tournaments, if they are allowed to happen, can't be cobbled together at the last minute.
 The MIAA's COVID-19 Task Force, in consultation with state health officials, formulated a plan for the fall season that did not include any playoffs, sectional or state. However, that doesn't necessarily mean that the rest of the school year is headed down a similar path.
 "The winter tournaments, the Fall II tournaments and the spring tournaments are very much on the table," said Dennis-Yarmouth principal Paul Funk, a member of both the TMC and the COVID-19 Task Force. "It's in the hands of the TMC to start planning for those. The only recommendation that came out of the COVID-19 Task Force was not to have a tournament for Fall I. I think as a group we need to start thinking about how would we have a tournament (for the winter)."
 Funk said the COVID-19 Task Force is planning to meet again this month to start mapping out a winter landscape.
 "I'm in favor of a winter tournament, a Fall II tournament and a spring tournament," Funk said. "I made it clear on the Task Force that I did not want to see those eliminated at that point. I would welcome, when I go to meet with (the Task Force), (having some recommendations from) the Tournament Management Committee about how you could run a tournament in a shortened period of time. You might have to play three games a week.
 "If you start the conversation early you're going to be better off."
 The TMC has scheduled its next meeting for Oct. 21, after the nine district athletic committees across the state have met.
 Scheduling complications for the winter are numerous.
 Westboro AD Johanna DiCarlo noted that her school is planning to have two-week blocks of remote learning after both Thanksgiving and Christmas, allowing students who may have attended large family gatherings to self-isolate; that impacts her ability to schedule games in those windows.
 Scott Paine, the Hull AD who is a member of both the MIAA ice hockey committee and the COVID-19 Task Force, said he is concerned about coordinating rinks for possible playoff games. "The facilities that we use for tournaments for hockey are flexible and they want to hold the tournaments," Paine said, "but as that time gets closer, their ability to be flexible will become less and less. I think we need to get on this pretty quickly."
 Jim O'Leary (St. John's Prep) advised his fellow TMC members to "go back to your districts and your leagues and see what their appetite is for tournaments and what type of tournament they think is important. That's the first thing we have to look at. The number of days you need to run a state tournament is much different than (the time frame for running) just a sectional tournament. We have to make that decision rather quickly about the venues.
 "We're not going to go to (TD) Garden (which usually hosts EMass basketball semifinals and hockey state championship games). We don't know if we'll get into colleges (for basketball and swimming state finals, for example). We have to make decisions about where we have (tournament games if they are going to happen) -- whether it's the highest seed (hosts games) all the way through (thereby doing away with neutral sites). There are a lot of layers to this. Those questions have to be asked at (the district) level."
 Buron's final take on the matter: "I'm going to tell my group (in District 8) to keep those (last) two weeks (of the winter season window) open for now (for potential playoffs). It could change and we'd have to add games later on if there is no tournament, but the membership down here is looking for some type of guidance as to what the length of the regular season will look like."
 Alignments approved
 As expected, approving the alignment for boys hockey was the trickiest vote taken on Thursday. The original proposal by the hockey committee had been voted down, 9-6, back in June because the hockey committee had strayed too far from strict TMC alignment protocols that had been adopted in December 2018 and approved by the Board of Directors in January 2019. In essence, the hockey committee tried to get ahead of the curve by anticipating schools' appeals to either move up or down divisions.
 The hockey committee came back with a less subjective approach, but some of the members still expressed concerns that health and safety was not being addressed, and they worried that programs might get stuck in divisions in which they would not be able to compete.
 Eventually the proposal was approved by a vote of 12-4. It carves the state into four divisions of either 48 or 49 teams. Expect plenty of appeals, though, with teams asking to either move up or down.
 Sherry Bryant, the MIAA associate director and TMC liaison, sought to allay fears that non-hockey people would be making ill-informed decisions about whether a program was strong enough to play safely in a division.
 "We as the TMC can be strategic and smart about who can serve on these alignment appeals to make sure we get the most knowledgeable folks in the room," she said.
 The other alignments proposals sailed through without any "no" votes. The cross country proposal features three divisions with nine sub-divisions for qualifying purposes. Indoor track will have five divisions, and golf will have three.

Brent Gates Jr. signs on the dotted line with Laval Rocket


--DocBreak--
With the game winning and series winning run 270 feet from home in the bottom of the seventh and two outs, Jérémy Robert stroked a triple to the centerfield gap cashing in David Dupuis to propel the Pirates to a 3-2 semi-final win over the Repentigny Seigneurs Élites at Parc Lausanne last Saturday night.“I felt this was the final, Repentigny is a very good team,” Laval manager Gilles Larouche said. “You had two great pitchers so it was going to a tough game for both sides.” Fans were anticipating a pitcher’s duel with Laval’s Étienne Lalonde and Repentigny’s Mathieu Pilon taking to the mound and the two delivered with solid complete game efforts. Laval jumped out to a 2-0 lead in their first at-bats when singles by Félix Lefebvre and Félix Laviolette raced home when designated hitter Cédrick Josph launched his first of two doubles in the contest. Following that, Pilon and Lalonde settled into a rhythm while both sides frittered away opportunities to push runners across the plate. There were some defensive gems, including a diving stab of a sharp grounder looking to head down the line that had extra bases written all over it by Pirate third baseman Jérémy Robert. Robert jumped up and made a lazar throw to first to nab Repentigny’s Samuel Bouchard-Beaudoin who led off the top of the third. The Seigneurs Élites made it a one run game in the top of the sixth when lead-off hitter Justin Brown got hit by an errant pitch by Lalonde to move to first. Brown advanced to second on a Lalonde error and raced home from third on a ground out by William Guénette. Repentigny went to the bench for a pinch hitter to lead off the top of the seventh with Philippe Lepage earning a free pass on one of only three walks issued by Lalonde, to put the potential tying run on first. A sacrifice bunt by Bouchard-Beaudoin advanced Lepage to second. Back-to-back singles by Joey Généreux and Jérémy Roy got the job done to make it 2-2. The Pirates didn’t make it easy on themselves after Laviolette started the home half of the seventh with a single. A too hard bunt by David Dupuis allowed Laviolette to be forced out at second putting Dupuis on first on the fielder’s choice play. Pilon won a huge battle getting Joseph to strikeout putting Laval in a two out hole with extra-innings looking possible. When Robert stepped in, he saw what he liked and cranked the game winning three bagger that sent Dupuis racing around those 270 feet. “This was a great challenge for the team,” manager Larouche said. “We have worked towards this (making the finals) and the team is ready.” This pits the regular season champion Pirates against the second place Roussillion Cobras in a battle for the playoff title. At press time, Laval opened the best of seven championship set Wednesday night at Lausanne against Roussillion. The series continues tonight at Parc Lausanne with an 8:00 pm start before the series shifts to Parc Leblanc in St. Constant for games three and four on Saturday and Sunday.

TAG Motorsport CRG Racing Team reached its target for the season as in his first Quebec Championship karting season Ilie Tristan Crisan finished second in the sixth and final round of Coupe de Montreal Briggs & Stratton LO206 Cadet Series Class Championship held Sunday, September 20 at the Jim Russell Karting Academy in Mont-Tremblant, Quebec. That second placing along with his winning runs in the first five rounds confirmed Crisan as the champion of his class. In actuality he needed only one lap to make that happen but Crisan made the full tour in his number 20 CRG Black Mirror kart. While he had first place finishes in the practice session, qualifying and pre final race, Crisan got caught behind a backmarker on the 14th and last lap of the race. Louis David Boucher took advantage of that to pass Crisan and take the checkered flag. Prior to that incident, Crisan had led 10 of the 14 laps of the hard fought race between the top three drivers. It was a busy weekend of racing for the young eight-year old champion. Crisan also competed in the Canadian Rotax Micro-Mini MAX Championship that awarded each class winner a ticket to compete in the 2021 Rotax Final in Portugal. Unlike the Cadet Class for drivers between the ages of 8 to 11 years old, the Micro-Mini race included drivers up to 13 years of age making a mix of two classes on the same course. Despite the age difference, Crisan stayed in the top 5 in the four competitions that led to the final race. Starting third in the 14-lap final, he held second place for 12 laps, including the last eight to finish half a second behind race winner Lucas Deslongchamps, aged 13. Crisan’s runner up finish gave him first place in his under 11 class and his ticket for the 2021 Portugal Rotax final. During the weekend, TAG Motorsport CRG welcomed two new young Quebec drivers at Mont-Tremblant, Louis Thomas Pelletier of Mirabel in the Cadet class and Olivier Pichette of Terrebonne in the Briggs Stratton Junior Class who started their first tests for 2021 in Mont-Tremblant.

FALL RIVER - Bob Karam says he knows an investment opportunity when he sees one.
 "I'm betting on the rail," he said.
 The founder and president of Fall River-based Karam Financial Group has wagered on what he anticipates will be the positive impact of the South Coast Rail project in stimulating economic growth.
 And particularly as it pertains to the Davol Street and Route 79/138 corridor adjacent the Taunton River running north from Braga Bridge to the now-defunct Brightman Street Bridge.
 The $1.1 billion MassDOT Phase 1 commuter rail project will connect Fall River, New Bedford and Taunton to Boston's South Station. Department of Transportation officials have said it will be completed by late 2023.
 "People will need a place to live, restaurants to go to and businesses to buy things," said Karam, whose business holdings include BK's Beacon Tavern on Airport Road and radio station WSAR in Somerset.
 But it's not just South Coast Rail that convinced the 76-year-old Karam to get involved in two independent redevelopment projects situated almost within sight of one another -- each of which sits on opposite sides of the central Route 79/138 corridor.
 Another major factor, he said, was MassDOT's Route 79-Davol Street Corridor Improvements Project.
 That project's $68 million second phase, which is due to be completed no later than 2025, will reconfigure Davol Street and Route 79 in order to create "an urban boulevard," made possible by lowering the level of the elevated, northbound section of Route 79.
 "The whole highway is coming down and being lowered to river level," Karam said.
 He says that he and Swansea-based BayCoast Bank are partners in a $12 million venture to transform the site of the former Davol Street Cafe at 697 Davol St. into a six-story building -- with 49 apartments on five floors and a BayCoast Bank branch with drive-thru lane on the first floor.
 Karam and BayCoast Bank, doing business as BCBBK LLC, in 2017 paid a total of $780,000 for the single-acre, former barroom site with its adjacent, dilapidated apartment house, both of which were demolished within a year of being bought.
 "We paid a premium price for the bar and the rundown apartment house," he said.
 Karam and BayCoast Bank are also partners in the ongoing transformation of the former Adams House nursing home on Highland Avenue into 34 market-rate apartments. Karam previously put the price tag for that project at $12 million.
 He said although all the Davol Street apartments will be listed as market- rate, at least "some of them" will be set aside as less expensive "workforce housing," which uses a formula based on one's earned income that falls short of an "area median income," or AMI for short.
 There will be a total of 69 parking spaces on premises, including three reserved for handicap parking.
 Karam says the MassDOT Route 79 and Davol Street improvement project includes the creation of two pedestrian walkways with traffic lights allowing people to safely walk back and forth to the city's waterfront district.
 One of those walkways, he said, will be situated almost directly across from his 697 Davol St. building, which will sit at the corner of the short, lower portion of Turner Street and Davol Street.
 "That's exactly why we bought it (three years ago). We were thinking ahead," Karam said.
 It just so happens that the new Fall River Depot train station at 825 Davol St. near Pearce Street will be only a short walk for anyone living in Karam's apartment building.
 The redesign of Route 79/138 and Davol Street, according to MassDOT, will "open up land opportunities for economic development; improve neighborhood connections to the Taunton River waterfront; and provide continuous accommodations for bicyclists and pedestrians."
 DOT says it will also improve the safety of vehicular travel within the corridor. Both local and state police for years have acknowledged that speeding on Route 79 and Davol Street has been a problem.
 Karam said he previously made an unsuccessful bid to buy the Jimmy's Used Tire Service building that sits in between his Davol Street site and both Teknikor Contracting Inc. and the two-year-old Rivervue Professional Building at 775 Davol St.
 He also says he hopes that someone eventually will buy the large, former Mackenzie & Winslow industrial building at 609 Davol St. that the city took by tax title two years ago.
 Construction work at Karam's 697-713 Davol St. site began in earnest this week, according to Dave Sanson, a project supervisor for Seekonk-based D.F. Pray, which has been hired to handle general contracting duties.
 Sanson said his company was also involved in the construction of the Knitting Mills Apartments project inside the Wampanoag Mill building at 69 Alden St. in the Flint, which is the neighborhood where Karam grew up.
 Tenants began moving into those 125 apartments in 2019; Sanson said he expects the Davol Street apartments will be ready for occupancy by early spring.
 Karam says he also plans to build either two separate apartment buildings or one larger, L-shaped apartment building closer to the Taunton River on the west side of Davol Street.
 He says he's purchasing both a multi-family house with a large, separate garage at 47 Hathaway St., as well as an adjacent apartment house at 48 Taylor St. -- the latter of which sits closer to the 14-story Point Gloria Condominiums and is now vacant and partially boarded up.
 Karam said he'll demolish both of them in order to improve the site and make room for the new apartments.
 Unlike the 697 Davol St. mixed-use project, Karam says he's doing this one on his own without the financial assistance of any investors.
 Karam says he prefers building and developing apartments as opposed to condominiums.
 "I'm afraid of condos," he said. "When you get to a certain size you need an on-site manager, and you can't always rely on the condo association to keep it up. With apartments we call the shots so that we can do right by the tenant but also for ourselves."
 Karam gives credit to local developer Anthony Cordeiro, who a decade ago with two partners spent more than $30 million to renovate and redevelop the former Mechanics Mill building at 1082 Davol St. into 103 loft apartments, with professional office and business space on the lower floors.
 "He got the whole thing going," Karam said.
