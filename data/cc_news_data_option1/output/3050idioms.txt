But if you don’t, you’d better be willing to go work at Publix and bag groceries.’ So he put a little pressure on the table but, obviously now that everything has come full circle, they can’t really complain on having a good job; it’s a very nice living, easy living and it’s definitely what I wanted to do.

But most haven’t ventured into the shore’s quiet places – maritime forests, marshes, wetlands and bays, where nature reigns. Natural land at the highly- developed Jersey shore is rare, which makes them all the more important for birds, wildlife and native plants, and all the more special for human visitors.
 Starting in the north, check out these special spots. I bet you will be surprised! Some bayside locations are notorious for biting flies in summer, so it’s best to pick a cooler day with a northwest breeze for those visits.
 Mount Mitchill – Did you know New Jersey is home to the highest point on the Atlantic coast south of Maine? At 266 feet, this rocky overlook in Atlantic Highlands is the highest natural elevation along the coast between Maine and Rio de Janeiro. Enjoy the stunning views of Sandy Hook, Sandy Hook Bay, Raritan Bay and the New York skyline. Named for Samuel Mitchill, an 18th and 19th century physician and naturalist, Mount Mitchill was preserved in 1973 due the efforts of a local citizens’ group to protect the site from development.
 Sandy Hook - Some of the country’s oldest American holly trees can be found in Sandy Hook’s nearly 300-acre holly forest. Head for the Sandy Hook unit of Gateway National Recreation Area, and hop on the multi-use trail. Check with the rangers to see if you can join a guided walk on the restricted trail through the holly forest. While you’re at Sandy Hook, see the lighthouse, the keeper’s cottage and the historic buildings at Fort Hancock.
 Navesink River – Not far from Sandy Hook and Mount Mitchill are Hartshorne Woods Park and Huber Woods Park, two Monmouth County parks located along the Navesink River, near the ocean. Popular with hikers, bikers and outdoor enthusiasts, these hilly parks offer scenic views and challenging trails and great birdwatching. Who says the Jersey shore is flat?
 William deCamp Wildlife Trail – Named for the late conservationist who fought to save land along Barnegat Bay, this 2.5 mile lightly trafficked out-and-back trail is located in Brick Township near the Mantoloking Bridge. This northernmost section of the Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge offers a scenic walk through a marsh to the western side of Barnegat Bay, and is best on a breezy day.

Facebook Inc. plans to lease the Farley Building, a centerpiece of a large New York City project in the works from Vornado Realty Trust , the companies announced Monday afternoon, sending Vornado shares higher in after-hours trading. Facebook is taking all of the available office space, about 730,000 square feet, in the Farley Building, which stretches between 31st and 33rd streets and 8th and 9th avenues in Manhattan. Vornado described Farley as the "cornerstone" of its Penn District project, for which it has 10 million square feet of space and allocated $2 billion to develop the area near Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. "The Farley Building will further anchor our New York footprint and create a dedicated hub for our tech and engineering teams," Robert Cookson, a Facebook vice president for real estate and facilities, said in the news release. "We look forward to being a part of this iconic New York City landmark's future for years to come." Vornado shares jumped more than 7% in after-hours trading after the announcement was made. The stock has suffered amid doubts about commercial real estate in the era of COVID-19, falling 48.8% so far this year.Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The top Democrats in the U.S. Congress and White House negotiators on Monday said they had made progress in talks on a new coronavirus relief bill, though the administration said President Donald Trump could act alone if no deal is reached.
 A key sticking point remains what to do about the $600-per-week enhanced unemployment benefit, a key lifeline for the tens of millions of Americans thrown out of work during the pandemic, which expired on Friday.
 “We're making some progress on certain issues, moving closer together,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters after Monday's talks. “There are a lot of issues that are still outstanding. But I think there is a desire to get something done as soon as we can.”
 Mr. Schumer, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows spent about two hours in talks on Capitol Hill. Mnuchin reported “a little bit of progress” in the talks.
 “We're open to a bigger package if we can reach an agreement,” Mnuchin told reporters. But Meadows later shot down that idea.
 Congressional Democrats and Republicans remain far apart on next moves, with Democrats standing behind a $3 trillion plan that passed the House in May and Republicans raising concerns over their own $1 trillion proposal laid out by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell last week.
 McConnell, who has not joined the bipartisan negotiations, blamed Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer for the lack of a deal.
 “The Democratic leaders insist publicly they want an outcome. But they work alone behind closed doors to ensure a bipartisan agreement is actually not reached,” he said on the Senate floor.
 ## Stalled talks
 After passing more than $3 trillion in relief legislation early in the crisis, Congress last week missed the Friday deadline to extend the enhanced unemployment payments that have played a key role in propping up the U.S. economy.
 Mnuchin and Meadows have taken the Republican lead in talks since McConnell's plan last week met immediate resistance from some of his fellow Senate Republicans.
 With a final deal still in doubt, the White House is seriously considering unilateral action to defer worker payments on payroll taxes, Stephen Moore, a member of Mr. Trump's economic recovery task force, told Reuters. He said such a move would inject up to $300 billion into the U.S. economy. The tax payments fund Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
 Mr. Trump could also unilaterally waive compliance for federal regulations that slow the formation of businesses and infrastructure projects, according to experts.
 “The president is always considering executive action in the absence of congressional leadership,” White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said when asked about possible unilateral action.
 The extension of enhanced federal unemployment benefits has proved to be a major stumbling block in the talks, and a top Federal Reserve official warned that failure to secure some form of extension would result in a weaker economy.
 McConnell is also demanding that comprehensive legislation include protection against COVID-19-related lawsuits for businesses, schools and churches. But Democrats have rejected the idea, and a source familiar with the negotiations said last week the White House had indicated it could go along with a bill that did not include the liability measure.
 Hours before the talks were due to resume, Ms. Pelosi told CNN she would not go along with Republican proposals to slash the weekly $600 unemployment benefit.
 The White House and congressional Republicans want to trim the weekly jobless aid, and have rejected as too costly the state and local assistance package that was included in legislation passed by the Democratic-led House in May.
 Republicans favoring a reduction in the unemployment aid have said it is a disincentive for people to go back to work.
 However, Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kaplan told Bloomberg TV on Monday that economic data does not show the $600-a-week benefit hurts the overall job market.
 There are some areas where lawmakers and the Trump administration may be able to come together quickly.
 Both Republicans and Democrats want to renew a moratorium on evictions, which had spared Americans the stress of being left homeless while out of work because of the pandemic. The moratorium expired on July 24.
 Likewise, there is broad support for another round of direct payments to taxpayers.

I wasn’t never really into going out and partying or anything like that, so I found a lot of time on the game and the goal was never to become a professional, it just kind of worked its way out to the point where it was like, ‘Ok. I’m exceptionally good at this game and there’s a professional league for it. So why not find a way to monetize what I’m doing?’ And for me, I really picked up the game heavily when I got hurt.

It remains to be seen if Land Rover will debut the Gen 5 next year as a 2022 model or in the 2022 calendar year, but one thing is certain. The Range Rover won't have it easy, not in this sea of luxury but also sporty SUVs. The Bentley Bentayga with the twin-turbo V8 comes to mind, and honorable mentions also go to the Lamborghini Urus and Rolls-Royce Cullinan.

"I’ll tell you this bro. KD – and I don’t know if he’s leaving his console on or what it is, if he’s sharing it with one of friends but KD has more hours logged into 2K20 than I do. And I was playing 20 [hours] a day. So, if that gives you insight to what that man has been doing during his rehab – I mean, KD was on vacation! Now I’ve seen him in the park and stuff and KD’s one of those people. I don’t know if anyone else on the Nets strikes me as a gamer other than KD. It seems like most of those guys – I heard Joe Harris doesn’t even use social media or anything, so I highly doubt that he’s on the game console. I mean, Kyrie might because the Earth’s flat, he might get his 2K in a little bit, but I don’t know man. DeAndre Jordan kind of strikes me as somebody who as you know, in his free time. I don’t know if he plays 2K, but I feel that he’s got a little bit of gaming in him."

Pero la reaccion de Unidas Podemos muestra la suspicacia que existe en el Gabinete de Pedro Sanchez. El Fondo de Reconstruccion aprobado por la UE afianza el plan inicial de aprobar los Presupuestos con sus socios de investidura. Ciudadanos solo tiene 10 diputados y su presencia en un hipotetico acuerdo presupuestario podria espantar mas votos de los que aporta. Pero en el Gobierno hay un plan B, ante las dudas, cada vez mayores, que existen sobre ERC. En la memoria del PSOE y de Unidas Podemos esta el recuerdo de febrero de 2019, cuando los republicanos tumbaron al Ejecutivo al rechazar el proyecto de Presupuestos y llevaron a la doble cita electoral de ese año.
