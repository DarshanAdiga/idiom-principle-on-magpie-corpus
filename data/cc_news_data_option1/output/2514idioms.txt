Seleshi Bekele, the Ethiopian minister of water, irrigation and energy, said on Saturday that the sides agreed to reach the final deal on the dam within up to three weeks.
 "Consensus reached to finalize the #GERD agreement within 2 to 3 weeks. AU and Bureau members will support the process of reaching agreement. The convening demonstrated 'seeking African Solution to African Problems' is a right pathway for Africa's problem solving. Africa can truly tackle it's problems effectively," the minister wrote on Twitter.
 The dam, officially known as the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, is under construction by Ethiopia and set to become Africa's largest, but Egypt and Sudan fear its effects on their own water security. The three countries have held dozens of rounds of talks but have failed to agree on how soon the dam should be filled.
 Cairo has proposed to extend the filling for 10 years, while Ethiopia is determined to do it in three years. In this case, Egypt and Sudan say they will fall short of 25 billion cubic meters of water annually with subsequent drought and crop failure.
 Last week, Egypt officially asked the UN Security Council to intervene in talks and prevent Addis Ababa from acting unilaterally amid stalled progress in the trilateral dialogue.
