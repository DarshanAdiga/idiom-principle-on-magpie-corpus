Peter "Pete" Bentley Barham Pete Barham, 79, passed away on August 22 in Fairway, KS. Pete was born January 5, 1942 in Boston, Massachusetts to parents Samuel and Phyllis Barham. Pete graduated from Topeka High School in 1960 and was an All American &amp; Record Breaking Swimmer. He attended the University of Kansas for undergraduate studies '64 and graduate school receiving a Master's Degree in Business '66\. During his KU years, he was a member of Alpha Tau Omega fraternity, remaining involved on the House Board for many years. He was a K-Club member, lettering in Swimming and Coaching for KU, and KU is where he met his wife, Vicki Allen Barham. After college Pete was the consummate salesman, owning his own businesses and mastering the art of meeting people and building relationships. He gave back to his community as a member of the Fairway City Council, as well as, the Homes Association. Pete belonged to the Plaza Men's Breakfast Club for 52 years, was a life-long member of the YMCA, and served on the vestry of St Andrews Episcopal Church. He continued his love of swimming by volunteering for 30 years as the Fairway Swim Team Starter for swim meets. His children will always remember him for holding the starter gun longer than normal so they'd not have an advantage, causing them to start the race from behind the others. He loved making sure they didn't have a "home" advantage. Pete was bigger than life and we will miss his infectious "Big Laugh" and love of life. He had a tender heart within a tough shell, always making sure everyone was included, especially those who could use a father figure, friend, or a piece of advice. He could be counted on to organize the "kitchen crew" for any group events or fishing trips. He loved sharing life's biggest lessons like "going into the corners High and coming out Low", teaching his kids to be self- sufficient, how to fix a car, and being YoPa/Grandpa Pete to his grandchildren. Jayhawks rule! Miz-who? Besides his parents, he was preceded in death by his brother, Jeb Barham and his sister, Dale Barham Evans. He is survived by his wife of 56 years, Vicki Allen Barham, his children Suzanne Barham Burt (Rick), Ben Barham, and Marcy Barham Ostrander (Wade). His grandchildren are Colin Burt, Cameron Burt, Jordan Barham Whitlock, and Grace Barham. A private family service will be held.

The number of confirmed coronavirus cases globally has topped 25 million, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. The US leads the count with 5.9 million cases, followed by Brazil with 3.8 million and India with 3.5 million.The real number of people infected by the virus around the world is believed to be much higher – perhaps 10 times higher in the US, according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention – given testing limitations and the many mild cases that have gone unreported or unrecognised.Global deaths from Covid-19 stand at more than 842,000, with the US having the highest number at 182,779, followed by Brazil with 120,262 and Mexico with 63,819. The figures come as India registered a record 78,761 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, the worst single-day spike in the world.The Health Ministry also reported 948 deaths in the past 24 hours, taking total fatalities to 63,498.Sunday&rsquo;s surge has raised the country&rsquo;s total virus tally to over 3.5 million and comes at a time when India is reopening its subway networks and allowing sports and religious events in a limited manner from next month as part of efforts to revive the economy.The crowded subway, a lifeline for millions of people in the capital New Delhi, will be reopened in a phased manner from September 7.Schools and colleges will, however, remain closed until the end of September. The South Asian country has the third-highest caseload after the United States and Brazil, and its fatalities are the fourth-highest.Even as eight Indian states remain among the worst-hit regions and contribute nearly 73% of the total infections, the virus is now spreading fast in the vast hinterlands, with experts warning that the month of September could be the most challenging.

“It was a rough week for us,” said Troutman, now in his 24th year guiding Beckman. “We lost some girls late last week, played with fill-ins who did a tremendous job. Without working on our rotation, they really stepped up. I couldn’t be more proud of how these girls responded.
 “They picked their teammates up. That’s what being a team is all about.”
 This was not your typical Cascade tournament. Twelve teams were divided into three pools. Each squad sat on the same side of the bench for the duration of the day, with Cougars athletic director Adam Kedley wiping down chairs between each match.
 Each of the three courts had designated sanitizers wiping down each ball between points. There was no bracket play, no concessions and spectators were at a socially distanced minimum — each wearing masks.
 Despite all of this, three Dubuque County schools — Beckman, Dubuque Senior and Cascade — were each able to find success and discover something about themselves at the close of the first week of season. And above all, all three teams were just happy to get out and play.
 “They’ve come out with a positive mindset and taken advantage of the opportunity to play,” said Cougars coach Mary Frake, whose team also went undefeated. “We’re not necessarily looking long term. We are taking it day by day and enjoying every opportunity that we can to play.”
 Troutman discovered that yet again his Blazers are deep and versatile. His hampered roster forced him to alter his lineup and put players in positions they’d never played before.
 Yet Beckman was able to grind to three quality wins. The Blazers swept both East Buchanan (21-8, 21-8) and Monticello (21-14, 21-9) and outlasted Jesup in three sets, 21-15, 12-21 and 15-10. Running a 5-1 offense for the first time on varsity, Makayla Koelker led Beckman with 59 total assists. Lauren Osterhaus finished with 25 kills, Kylee Rueber added 18 and Nell McDermott led the Blazers with 29 digs.
 “We honestly knew that we just had to play our game with what we had and we’re honestly just lucky to play every game we have, even with the circumstances we’re in with missing players,” said Koelker, a senior and one of six returning starters from Beckman’s 2019 Iowa Class 2A state runner-up finish. “We knew we had to come in here strong. Play our position, play together.”
 First-year Rams coach Haley Zenner liked what she saw from her group as well. After opening the season with a four-set win over Waterloo West on Tuesday, Senior continued its early roll to 2020 with a 2-1 outing at Cascade.
 The Rams swept Central Elkader (21-7, 21-10), beat Anamosa in three (16-21, 21-12, 15-7) and lost to Springville (21-19, 8-21, 17-15). Katelyn Egan finished with 32 assists and six kills and Emma Link had 23 digs and eight aces to pace Senior.
 “I missed volleyball so much and it felt good to finally be able to come back and train — it’s been great,” said Egan, a senior and the Rams’ starting setter for the past three seasons. “We’re just a solid unit together. We all play together very well and we cooperate really well with each other. Good team chemistry at the end of the day.”
 Frake’s lineup contains a lot of new faces compared to last year. With limited training through the summer because of the pandemic, the new-look Cougars had only a couple of short weeks to gel before 2020’s first serve.
 So Frake was quite pleased with Saturday’s results, a sign that Cascade is starting to come together. The Cougars swept Waterloo East (21-13, 21-12) and Central City (21-14, 21-17) and bounced back to defeat North Linn in three, 21-23, 21-14 and 15-11.
 McKenna Gehl finished with 14 total kills and six aces, Megan Smith had 53 assists and five aces, and Brooke Denniston added 26 digs to lead Cascade.
 “We really pulled together and became a team and got some wins in,” said Denniston, a senior libero. “I’m just happy that we can get every game that we can in. Hopefully this season doesn’t end and we can have a full season.”
 Volleyball season continues into next week, but there’s an air of uncertainty hovering over 2020, Frake said. Nobody wants to be in this position, but if there’s a silver lining, this season has taught players a fairly important lesson: Savor the moment.
 That was the biggest takeaway from the Cascade Invite.
 “The biggest thing with them is they get to appreciate the moment,” Frake said. “Whether it’s a weeknight game or a tournament, they get to appreciate that moment because they have that opportunity right then.”
