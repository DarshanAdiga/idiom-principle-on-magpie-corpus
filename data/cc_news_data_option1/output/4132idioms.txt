“First and foremost, you've got to go after strike one, but it's got to be a quality strike,” he said. “The thing that I've really leaned on is my ability to be unpredictable and change and adapt my game plan to every hitter that I face. And so after the first pitch, I really have five different weapons that I can come at you with, and that makes me dangerous. They know I'm going to be in the zone, they know I'm going to be attacking with every single pitch I have, so you have to swing the bat. And guys don't want to get into a two- strike count, because we do have a lot of options to go to on both sides of the plate and up and down. I've really worked on trying to be efficient and go deep into a game. Really, I’m trying to get an out in less than two pitches after strike one.”
 That unpredictability is noticeable in his usages. After using his changeup 23.9% of the time in 2019, he used it just 14.3% of the time in 2020. While his fastball usage was up from 39.3% to 45.3%, his cutter usage went up from 20.7% to 24.3%. The changeup was his best pitch in 2018 and 2019, but that didn't mean it had to be in 2020.

Autumn is always a time of promises. Even this year. Even in Columbia.
 As nature takes its annual hiatus, trading lush canopies and Hellish humidity for crispy days and trees sluggish and austere, we have the promise that, given time to rest and restore, the natural beauty that we love about the south will return, rich and rejuvenated, ready to follow the enduring design that results in change, growth and progress forward.
 It’s a promise that has yet to be broken.
 We need promises we can count on these days.
 For more than six months now, most of us have done the right thing. Despite localized weirdness, like having small segments of the city reject CDC- recommended pandemic precautions to gather cheek to jowl in a basic bigot bar while the rest of the city fears them like they’re the walking dead, most of us have behaved ourselves. We’ve washed our hands and worn our masks and given up most of the events, occasions and surreptitious happenstances that give us joy.
 We’ve done this for COVID, and we’ve done this for each other.
 It’s time for promises to be kept.
 Lord knows there are promises a plenty being tossed around these days. It’ is election season, after all.
 Specific to South Carolina however, there are promises being offered we know will never be fulfilled.
 Senator Lindsay Graham, who is running for re-election on a Pecksniffian platform, has built such a legacy of breaking promises that he doesn’t even try to bury the bodies anymore.
 When it comes to Medicare and Social Security, for example, Graham famously said in July 2019 that these programs are “promises we can’t keep,” effectively informing the 1 million South Carolinians on Medicare, 96 percent of whom are seniors, that they are on their own. The only kind of security he offered was in the form of an almost 2 trillion dollar tax break for the bloated and entitled corporations to whom he is indebted.
 And, of course, there’s his unabashed declaration of hypocrisy from a 2018 interview in The Atlantic, where he assured us, “I want you to use my words against me,” promising that if there is a Supreme Court opening in the “last year of President Trump’s term, and the primary process has started, we’ll wait ’til the next election” to confirm a new justice.
 Another promise broken. Another invitation to lose faith that we can believe anything any political candidate says.
 Democratic challenger Jaime Harrison, on the other hand, is carefully building a career, and the legacy of responsibility that accompanies a carefully constructed career, based specifically on making promises he knows he can keep. And keeping them.
 Unwilling to play the political pastime of pledge, feign and dodge, and having promised to give back to the Orangeburg community that raised him, Harrison returned to his roots after attending Yale undergrad to teach high school at the same school from which he graduated.
 Born to a teenaged mom and raised by his grandparents in a mobile home where milk in his cereal was a luxury, Harrison vowed to provide permanent shelter for his family, buying them their own home when he finished Georgetown Law.
 Intimately aware of the systemic obstacles facing an impoverished young Black person as they try to improve themselves and their communities through education and training, Harrison took a job as the COO of an organization called College Summit. Now called Peer Forward, since 1993 this NPO has helped more than 350,000 low-income youths find a way to go to college and ostensibly level their playing fields as they build their lives and the future of this country.
 An aide to Congressman James Clyburn, Harrison returned to the party that mentored him becoming not only a role model, but the first African-American chair of the state Democratic Party from 2013 to 2017.
 While little can be done to return the evil genie of COVID-19 to the bottle from which Trump and GOP leadership facilitated its release and circulation, Harrison told us in his debate with Graham on Oct. 3, “We need leaders who are going to step up and act,” and criticized Graham for opposing an extension of unemployment benefits for Americans who have lost their jobs to COVID-19.
 “I will never, never, never, never lie to you,” Harrison promised. “I am not going to go back on my word.”
 Based on his history of promises made and promises kept so far, I am inclined to believe this committed young candidate.
 Graham doesn’t even ask us to anymore.

Planning to hit the road for some fun family times this fall? Travel has been severely curtailed over the past months, but as things open up now and in the future, make sure you pack these tips to help save time, money and maybe even a few frazzled nerves.
   
 Photocopies Just In Case
   
 Before you leave, make two photocopies of everything in your wallet, both front and back (credit card, driver's license, medical insurance card, etc.). Put one copy inside your luggage, and leave the other at home. If you should lose your wallet, you'll have all the information you need to quickly report and replace.
   
 Lost Passport
   
 You can ease the pain of losing your passport while traveling abroad if you simply take an extra passport photo with you. Keep it in a safe place, along with your passport number and the date of issue. Now all you have to do is take the photo and numbers to the closest U.S. Embassy. It should take hours, not days, to get a replacement.
   
 Home Time
   
 If you take medications, take an extra watch, and keep it set on home time. You'll never have to wonder when to take your medicine.
   
 Car Organizer
   
 A pocket shoe bag hung over the back of the front seat can hold small toys, crayons and other loose items in the car.
   
 Disappearing Ink
   
 A disappearing-ink marking pen, available at any fabric store, is great for marking maps. In a day or so, your marks will fade, and your map will be all ready for the next trip.
   
 Save On Room Rates
   
 Always call the local hotel desk instead of the 800 reservation number to get the best deals. Ask about weekend rates, holiday and seasonal specials, or discounts for affiliations you might have, such as the Automobile Club of America.
   
 Single Bag
   
 If an overnight stop is on your car trip itinerary, pack a small bag with one change of clothes for each family member and basic toiletries. Instead of unpacking the whole car, everything you'll need for the night is in just one bag.
   
 Packing List
   
 Toss the checked-off packing list you used to prepare for the trip into your suitcase. Use it to recheck when gathering everything at the end of your stay.
   
 Test the Weight
   
 After packing for a trip and just before leaving the house, pick up your bag, and carry it around for a full five minutes. If you're out of breath, it's too heavy. Eliminate what you can, or pack two smaller, lighter bags instead of one heavy one.
   
 Travel Iron
   
 A hair dryer can double as a travel iron. Dampen the creased garment, and spread it on a flat surface. Set the dryer on warm, and hold it in one hand while smoothing the item with the other.
   
 Vacationing Pets
   
 Have a special ID tag for any pet that's traveling with you. Include the name and telephone number of someone who will be able to get a hold of you while you're away from home.

Thus, Delta has cut aircraft capex for the rest of 2020 to nearly zero.

Kameko will bypass Qipco British Champions Day at Ascot on Saturday and head straight to next month’s Breeders’ Cup meeting.
 The 2000 Guineas winner bounced back to winning ways with victory in the Joel Stakes at Newmarket late last month, following a luckless run that had seen him finish fourth in the Derby, Sussex Stakes and Juddmonte International.
 Trainer Andrew Balding and owners Qatar Racing had been considering an outing in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, but the likelihood of very soft ground means the Kitten’s Joy colt will instead plot a direct route to the Breeders’ Cup Mile at Keeneland on November 7.
 David Redvers, racing manager for Sheikh Fahad’s operation, said: “Given the ground at Ascot is going to be testing, Kameko will go straight to the Breeders’ Cup and will not run on Saturday.”
 Kameko had been as short as 4-1 with some bookmakers for the Ascot Group One, with the John Gosden-trained Palace Pier an odds-on favourite.

When Halloween returns each October, so do the 50-year-old memories for actress Judith O'Dea who starred as Barbra in the 1968 horror classic "Night of the Living Dead" as one of several characters taking refuge in an isolated farmhouse under attack from flesh-eating ghouls.      O'Dea remembers watching the film on the big screen for the first time when it premiered in her hometown of Pittsburgh, where the film was also shot, although she recalls identifying more as an audience member rather than one of the cast.      "I looked at myself and began critiquing my performance," said O'Dea from Flagstaff, Arizona. "Then suddenly I found myself forgetting it was Judith O'Dea up there and became wrapped up in the storyline. That was a wonderful indication of a powerful story that could hold people's attention."      Over the years, O'Dea has also learned to look beyond the film's horror scenes and appreciate director George Romero's filmmaking skills.      "There's a scene where I'm pressing the button on a musical box which George was shooting from the floor up," she explained. "He was shooting right through the box and for a fraction of a second you see Barbra's eyes which I thought was a beautiful artistic shot. Then at the end when it alternates between still shots of the bodies and live-action, that was a great effective use of the camera."      The film, says O'Dea, broke barriers in the industry.      "As an independent movie made outside Hollywood, it raised its own money which I guess you could call one of the first Kickstarter's for a film. It was also filmed almost like a docudrama - unusual for the 60s - and there's no happy ending because everybody died."      Shot on a shoestring budget of just $114,000, O'Dea says her final scene being dragged from the farmhouse still haunts her.      "In your mind it's all pretend, but you get involved in the scene," she said. "With all those ghoul hands grabbing at me, it was actually quite frightening and took me back to the fear I felt as a child when I saw Vincent Price's face fall apart in the (1953) 'House of Wax.' That scared me so badly my folks had to take me from the theater. Whenever I'm called upon to be frightened in a role, I just think of that Vincent Price scene."      Another memorable scene from the film produced one of the classic lines in all horror films, said to O'Dea's character by actor Russell Streiner who plays her brother in the opening cemetery scene shot at the Evans City Cemetery in Pennsylvania.      "I don't think a week goes by that someone doesn't come up to me and say, 'They're coming to get you Barbra!'" said O'Dea, laughing. So has she grown weary of hearing the quote through all these years?      "How could I be tired of hearing something that has changed my life so considerably?" she says. "I love it when fans repeat the line to me. I feel so lucky to have been a part of something that was so different and has lasted so long."

While early steps in this direction have been taken by the Government, the problem requires to be dealt on war footing. We need a constant stream of funds for educating and creating awareness about mental health and chronic issues around it. The need of the hour is to provoke masses to learn about mental health through campaigns. This will help them address mental issues in a timely and effective manner and live a stress-free life. The campaign will also encourage people to talk about their mental well-being and reach out to a therapist or psychiatrist, in case they need to do so. Timely intervention, awareness about the issue, availability of professional help and appropriate policies is the only way to improve the situation. It is thus imperative to believe and propagate that people with mental illness deserve to live their lives with dignity and confidence. It requires a collaborative public-private- social partnership to change things considerably.

 # Have you missed Ad Astra's pillowy pastries? The Seaside bakery nears its GoFundMe goal
 Angelica Cabral
 Salinas Californian
 View Comments
 Ad Astra is a Latin phrase that in English means “to the stars.”
 While Ron Mendoza, the owner and chef of Ad Astra Bread Co., is firmly rooted in the Monterey Peninsula and has been for 13 years, the response to his GoFundMe was out of this world.
 As of Tuesday, the bakery raised more than $40,000 of their $55,000 goal to help support the business through economic hardships.
 Mendoza, who has been a pastry chef for 20 years, started the bakery with his girlfriend. He was between jobs decided to pass the time by making bread.
 “No one was really making the breads that I wanted to make or that I wanted to eat in the Peninsula,” Mendoza said.
 In 2019, the couple rented out a 400 square foot space from Other Brother Beer Company and converted it into a kitchen. It was important for Mendoza to get a bread oven that could make multiple loaves of bread.
 They ended up investing in a modular electric oven, common in Europe.
 The oven was approved by the engineers and contractors but they soon realized that between the brewery and the new equipment, they didn’t have enough electrical power.
 Mendoza came up with a temporary fix. He used a diesel fuel generator while the couple waited for PG&E; to fix the problem, but that’s taken over a year.
 “Basically every time we would come into the kitchen when we would start our shifts, we would have to go outside, turn on the generator…and flip the breaker switch so that power would go into the kitchen,” Mendoza said.
 The bakery even started selling at farmer’s markets, which was a hit.
 But the Catch-22 was that the more business they did, the more they’d have to bake, meaning they were keeping the generator running for longer and paying for more fuel.
 Ultimately, it never evened out and they couldn’t get ahead, Mendoza said.
 It was costing between $6,000 and $8,000 a month to power the building, so in late September Ad Astra Bread Co. shut down.
 “Eventually it caught up to us. Our bank account went into the negative, mostly trying to get the generator,” Mendoza said. “So the best thing for us was to just have them take [the generator] away, which means we lost power.”
 The GoFundMe was created to help pay for several business-related expenses including six weeks' pay for their employees ($29,500) and the remainder of the cost for the contractor and PG&E; work ($18,000).
 Because Ad Astra is a small business, Mendoza wanted to reach out to those in the community for help.
 And the carb-loving Monterey County residents didn't disappoint.
 “It was great because the community was just there and that’s what we wanted to do was just supply them, basically the Monterey Peninsula, with good bread to have for dinner, for sandwiches, for all kinds of stuff,” he said.
 Those looking for a sweet and flakey cardamon bun, there's good news. Ad Astra is still on track to open on Oct. 24 or Oct. 25, according to Mendoza.

La alta dependencia de Estados Unidos para la exportacion de vehiculos, falta de mano de obra calificada, menores ventas en el mercado interno y la incertidumbre politica, son los principales riesgos que enfrentara la industria automotriz en Mexico despues de la pandemia.   Francisco Bautista, socio lider del Segmento de Manufactura Avanzada y Movilidad de EY, dijo que la dependencia a Estados Unidos de las exportaciones automotrices es un riesgo para Mexico porque la cadena esta muy integrada a ese mercado, pero si las ventas en ese pais no levantan despues de la pandemia, el sector se vera muy afectado.   Adicionalmente, el T-MEC representa mayores restricciones para exportar hacia Estados Unidos. "El T-MEC en el corto plazo es un costo para las empresas incluso si cumples con todos los requisitos.   "El simple proceso de cumplir con las nuevas reglas de origen y lo que necesites de documentacion, ya es un costo adicional", explico Bautista durante el webinar El futuro de la industria automotriz.   EY destaco que los fabricantes de vehiculos se encuentran en un proceso de transformacion por los cambios de preferencia entre los consumidores, nuevas ofertas de movilidad, tecnologia y restricciones al libre comercio.   Bautista estima que en el pais ya no habra inversiones para instalar nuevas plantas, pues existe suficiente capacidad productiva instalada.   Las inversiones que se veran a futuro seran para fabricar nuevos modelos o nuevas tecnologias como autos electricos, pero no aumentara la capacidad de produccion.   En cuanto a la disponibilidad de proveedores para fabricar autos electricos, agrego, a pesar de que existen grandes fabricantes de autopartes, Estados Unidos esta mas avanzado en cuanto a tecnologia e investigacion para el desarrollo de baterias.   Ademas, el pais no produce muchos de los minerales necesarios para fabricar baterias electricas.   Bautista comento que la industria automotriz tambien tiene el reto desde hace varios años de atraer talento.   "Constantemente estan buscando iniciativas con Universidades, con gobierno para impulsar el crecimiento de la mano de obra.   "En una epoca de transformacion como la que estamos viviendo, desafortunadamente se va a ampliar la brecha porque necesitan aprender nuevas tecnologias y habilidades", aseguro.   EY estima que las ventas de autos en el pais tendran una recuperacion en L y sera hasta 2024 cuando se vuelvan a comercializar los mismos niveles de vehiculos que en 2019, otro reto para los fabricantes de vehiculos.   En cuanto al nuevo gobierno, Bautista dijo que hay "comentarios muy fuertes" que generan incertidumbre y la industria automotriz esta muy pendiente de los discursos.   "Se ve que pueden quitar algunos temas como la reforma energetica.   "A la industria le preocupa la regulacion y que pueda venir un cambio drastico porque si ya estan en un proceso de transformacion, otro cambio los puede complicar mas", detallo.   EY destaco que la industria automotriz genera 4 millones de empleos en el pais y es uno de los principales impulsores de las exportaciones, de ahi su importancia para la economia del pais.

 In December, a House-commissioned investigation concluded that then-Rep. Matt Shea of Spokane Valley had participated in and planned domestic terrorism against the United States, citing his involvement with three standoffs against the government. Shea has denied the findings of the report — which was passed along to the FBI and U.S. Attorney’s Office — calling it false and a “Marxist smear campaign.”
 GOP House Minority Leader J.T. Wilcox of Yelm later received online threats for suspending Shea from the Republican caucus in light of the report.

The season of partisan bickering between our beloved town PACs, Charlestown Citizens Alliance and Charlestown Residents United, is upon us.
 The CCA identifies as an unaffiliated environmental conservation organization, when in actuality, it is a registered Political Action Committee looking to continue its monopoly on the political narrative here in Charlestown by putting forth five “independent” candidates with the exact same platform. CCA dispenses the same basic common-sense talking points, like clean water, low taxes, and quality education (items EVERY candidate agrees on), while pitting fellow citizens against one another by presenting false binaries and misleading information to the community. Additionally, the CCA’s pay-to-play platform admittedly caters to our seasonal residents, while continuing to ignore the needs of young families trying to make ends meet during a global pandemic.
 As a town councilor and South County native, I would be a true advocate for our full-time and seasonal residents, on BOTH sides of the highway. We can still hold on to the charm and rural character of Charlestown while providing affordable housing options and ample job opportunities for young citizens looking to raise their families here in town. In order to retain Charlestown’s identity as a family community, we need to start providing the opportunities to allow the best and brightest of South County to actually stay here in South County!

The weather was cold and breezy but good conditions for running and a big improvement on the week before.
 There were two races at the Runthrough Olympic Park - 5K and 10K – with runners for the 10K setting off in two waves and in groups of four every 10 seconds; no mass start to ensure compliance with Covid restrictions.
 It was four laps of an undulating but fast course for the 10K and first up for East London Runners was Paul Quinton in a personal best of 33.30.
 It was an amazing achievement from Quinton whose previous personal best was some 20 years ago. As if that wasn’t enough, he was the first male vet over 40.
 Next up was Jamie Xavier in a respectable time of 43.32 followed by team-mate Ross Lucas in 48.39.

Delaware's Teacher of the Year is a teacher of English learning students in New Castle County's Red Clay School District.   Kimberly Stock received the honor in a virtual ceremony Tuesday hosted by the Department of Education and Education Secretary Susan Bunting. She teaches at McKean High School.   20 local district and charter school teachers of the year were in the running.   Stock's commitment to English learners likely comes from her own background.   She was abandoned as a child in South Korea, lived with a foster family, then was adopted by a white family in Nebraska.   She does not know her age, her birthplace or her given name.   Kimberly Stock will represent Delaware as a candidate for National Teacher of the Year.   She also receives a grant of $5,000 for the benefit of her students' educations, as well as additional personal grants totaling $5,000. “We must provide moments for our most vulnerable students to shine. When I surveyed staff about their training in English learner teaching methods, few said they had ever taken even one class. Meanwhile our EL population has grown over 81 percent in the last five years at McKean, making everyone a teacher of English learners,” Stock said.

 # Hoselton celebrating 100th year in business
 Messenger Post Media
 Monroe County Post
 Hoselton Auto Mall, 909 Fairport Road, East Rochester, is marking its 100th anniversary this year by giving back to local businesses.
 Hoselton opened as a service garage in 1920. In 100 years, the company expanded to offer Chevrolet, Nissan and Toyota new car departments; a pre- owned vehicle operation; vehicle maintenance; repair and full-service facilities; a collision center; wholesale parts; rental cars; and an insurance agency.
 “My family and I feel so honored to reach the 100-year milestone and have the privilege to continue my great-grandfather’s legacy of serving this community,” said President Drew Hoselton, a fourth-generation family member to work at Hoselton.
 To celebrate this milestone, Hoselton purchased $100 gift cards to 15 local businesses. These are included with new and pre-owned vehicle purchases in October.
 “This initiative to support our local community while celebrating our own 100 years as a local business felt like the perfect fit, this year more than ever,” said Dan McMorrow, director of new vehicle sales.

Council members insist they wanted the money saved from the Navigation Team to be used to pay other outreach workers, but that hasn't happened yet and might not until next year.
 One would think you’d get the new team up and running before cancelling the old one. But that phrase “one would think” is being used, futilely, to try to divine meaning out of many a City Hall action recently.
 Residents say the coronavirus threat for the homeless concerned them, too, so at first they welcomed some campers to the park. But now they feel abandoned.
 “The city recently removed just such a camp from Cal Anderson park,” one resident wrote, referring to the park on Capitol Hill. “But that park is in a wealthier, more high-profile neighborhood, so apparently the ‘policy’ has been suspended there.”
 What could the city have done instead? We’re nearly eight months into the pandemic, and it sure seems like we should have more socially distanced shelter options by now, such as more motel rooms. Or remember that field hospital in the stadium district the military and FEMA set up in a couple days? Do that except for the homeless. Building housing is great, but it takes years.
 Regardless, this is where we are right now: We’ve got an encampment digging in at a children’s play area in a city park, situated in a city housing authority development specifically designed around reliance on that park.
 And the city’s not only not doing anything about it, but, sorry New Holly, get used to it, because it doesn’t have any agreed-upon framework for doing anything about it in the future either.

Walmart is a great stock, and with so many activities in the pipeline, it's a safe bet for continued growth. It also pays a dividend. But Lululemon has high momentum, and with vertical and horizontal opportunities, its stock is likely to outdo Walmart's in the near term, and is therefore the better buy today.

Sherrill Mane, Executive Advisor, Strategy, The 614 Group said, "The Think Tank's call to automate workflow, to augment people and to find solutions to identity management is vital to successful outcomes. The advertising workflow automation paper includes a POV on the current lack of automated workflow for video content that spans 'new' TV, digital video and legacy TV, and calls for cross industry collaboration on measurement standards and on cleaning up nomenclature for ad units, among other elements. Solutions will result in more nimble planning, buying and reporting that marketers and advertisers need now and in the future."
