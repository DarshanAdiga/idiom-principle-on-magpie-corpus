A couple of days ago, Head Coach Doug Pederson said Peters is going to stay at right guard for the time being and Pryor will start at left tackle. I heard him say it, but I still don't believe it. Philadelphia Inquirer writer Jeff McLane was the first to report that Peters remains at right guard because he wants to get a substantial raise in order to move to left tackle and so far the Eagles have refused to pay the money. This same story was reported by Tim McManus of ESPN and it's been swirling around the Birds for four or five days. Pederson didn't answer a question about this matter when he was asked about it a couple of days ago. He did a great job of changing the subject and emphasizing how great Peters was doing at right guard.

In their introductions, the candidates for the most part staked out their positions as the incumbents also took some bows for their work in the last two years.
 “My first Clean Elections debate was four years ago and in that debate, I said if I was elected, I would primarily focus on two things: one being help restore education funding for our K-12 schools and two, to help bring some bipartisanship back to the State Capital. Four years later, that’s exactly what I’ve done and I have the record to prove it,” Bowie said.
 His opponent noted she has lived in the district 28 years and decided to run for office because “I love Arizona and love this country.”
 “I want to be a voice to help shape Arizona’s future. I want to bring common sense and less partisan policies to the office,” Sharer said, adding she wants to “eliminate excessive government interference in our lives” and more legislative restraint. She later accused Bowie of contributing to socialism.
 Epstein touted her corporate and small-business background and her advocacy for education funding and the environment, stating, “Now, especially during this pandemic, we need clean air. COVID attacks the lungs and today is the 11th day in a row that we’ve had pollution alerts for Maricopa County.”
 Hawker, a retired federal government computer programmer who won a spot on the ballot with a write-in campaign, said he wants to appeal to “those who understand the real danger of today’s Democratic Party, which Democrat- controlled cities have manifested in their violent chaos.”
 “Combine these failures with their family-decimating social engineering – which these two House candidates have demonstrated with bills they sponsored of infanticide and forcing gender fantasy legally enforced in birth certificates, death certificates and driver’s licenses,” Hawker said.
 He later took a swing at his party’s governor, attacking “the inconsistent and tyrannical extremism” of his executive orders.
 Jermaine touted her work in fighting violence against Native American women and her bipartisanship, stating, “I have a track record of reaching across the aisle to solve problems and get results for our community.”
 Robson, a former legislator, said he is running “because I believe we’re not being truly represented the right way.”
 “I want to be part of the solutions to really complex problems that face our state,” he said. “Talking about things are nice. “Getting up and bellowing about stuff is nice, but substantive work is important.”
 The first of several pandemic-related questions dealt with one of the most controversial – reopening K-12 campuses – while the second dealt with business shutdowns and whether the Legislature should reign in the powers of the governor to act unilaterally.
 Jermaine, Bowie and Robson favored leaving the decision in the hands of local school boards and while Epstein agreed, she also said the state should have given school boards better benchmarks for weighing reopening.
 While saying she believes “in things being handled locally,” Sharer stated, “We were told there would be options, an option to reopen and have in-person classrooms and we haven’t been afforded that option. I’ve heard from a lot of parents and a lot of teachers and they’re really disappointed that that has not been put out there….There should be guidelines and timelines set forth to make that happen.”
 Saying he had “mixed feelings on the question,” Hawker bemoaned the fact that “no one can get the Legislature called back to discuss the issue. They don’t seem to want to go back to deal with this unique problem. I think there are a lot of ways in which the limits of the various authorities throughout the state need to be much better defined.”
 Saying, “I don’t think there’s a need to have the schools closed at this time” and that a majority of parents want their children in classrooms, Hawker added that school boards should have the option to decide whether to close if there is a local outbreak of the virus.

Prima di intervenire le squadre di Smaltimento degli armamenti esplosivi devono saper riconoscere una bomba tra centinaia di esemplari. I militari sono anche estremamente disponibili alla condivisione delle loro conoscenze con le unità presenti sul campo, considerato che gli ordigni inesplosi sono una delle maggiori minacce per il mantenimento della pace e per la popolazione locale, la cui protezione è il principale obiettivo per la missione Kfor e i suoi alleati. Si tratta di un lavoro che sfrutta le moderne tecnologie come rilevatori di mine e robot in grado di ispezionare e disinnescare un dispositivo esplosivo da remoto e in modo sicuro per l'operatore, come ricorda la Kfor. Quando si avvicinano a un ordigno inesploso, gli operatori indossano di solito tute antimine di 30 chili ed elmetti protettivi di 7 chili. Tutti coloro che operano nelle missioni Nato in Kosovo sanno che la sicurezza e la libertà di movimento di cui godono tutte le comunità dal 1999 sono state ottenute anche grazie a loro. (Alt)

Not only was the timing off for Aldis but he also noted that he always wanted to feel like he and his matches with the NWA Worlds Championship felt like a big deal. He said he wanted people to have the same reactions to his matches as he did when he was watching wrestling growing up.
 "I wanted people to feel like when I step in the ring with the title, like I wanted people to feel like this is a big deal. Like this is a happening," Aldis described. "I don't have to be considered the best wrestler in the business. I don't have to be number one on the PWI 500, and I don't have to have people sort of saying, 'oh, he's the best.' When I wrestle, I want people to be like, 'this would be interesting. Cool, I'm ready to see that.' I wanted to have situations that made somebody at home feel the same way I felt when I watched like Rock and Triple H or Sting."
 On the Aug. 22 episode of _Dynamite_ , NWA Women's World Champion Thunder Rosa appeared and challenged Hikaru Shida for the AEW Women's World Championship at _All Out_. Aldis admitted on the podcast that he does not know what the future is with AEW and NWA, but he noted that Rosa vs. Shida is a big match making it a "no-brainer" when it came to making the match happen.
 "All I know, at this point in time and this is the truth and you're right, if there was more to it, I probably wouldn't be able to say but I genuinely don't know, but it was just a situation where they approached Billy [Corgan] and expressed their interest in wanting to book this sort of prize-fight match," Aldis explained. "I don't know. I probably should know, but I wasn't sure if there was any history prior to AEW and the NWA between Rosa and Hikaru Shida. I know that Rosa has wrestled in Japan a lot.
 "So I don't know it was just one of those things where it was presented, and it was a no-brainer. We said, 'that sounds like a good idea.' Ultimately, we were very confident in the reaction. We were very confident that that the fans would bite and feel like this was special because Rosa is special, and the NWA is special.
 Aldis noted that AEW and everyone else in the wrestling world are paying attention to what NWA has been doing with _NWA Powerrr_ and their big PPVs as Ricky Starks and Eddie Kingston have signed with AEW. He said that in order to create a genuine alternative to WWE, then everyone involved needs to put their egos aside for a relationship to go forward where AEW and NWA can co-exist and benefit from each other's strengths.
 "It's obvious that they have been paying attention based on the fact that they signed Ricky and they signed Eddie Kingston, nothing against Ricky," Aldis prefaced. "For example, no one went to bat harder than me for him because I couldn't believe that he was so relatively unknown. When I saw his stuff, I went, 'wow, this guy's TV ready,' but he wasn't someone that people were talking about. I was the one kind of pressing Billy and going, 'we need to bring this guy in, and obviously he's had great success now, but it's validating for the NWA and it's validating for our approach and our philosophy.
 "I think if everyone involved can put their egos to the side and can look at the bigger picture for sustainability for a genuine alternative to the WWE, which has an overwhelming market share, I think it makes all the sense in the world for a much broader, more succinct relationship going forward where we are able to maintain our own distinctive brand and style and they can do the same with theirs. And we can coexist and we can take advantage of their resources and they can take advantage of our approach and production capability in terms of our creative basically for lack of a better term.
 Aldis also noted that NWA also has their brand behind them as well. He recalled many in the wrestling world questioning Billy Corgan's decision to buy NWA. He said that with NWA's historical significance and AEW's partnership with Tuner Broadcasting, then they would have the reach to bring back fans who left wrestling after the end of WCW.
 "And obviously, the other thing is the brand. People had so many sideways comments when Billy bought the rights to the NWA," Aldis pointed out. "There were 'what's the point in that? No one cares about that anymore.' Well, we sure reminded them quick, and obviously, AEW is starting from square one in terms of historical significance and sort of bragging rights and the value that comes with that. Aside from the WWE, there is no other American brand that can offer that sort of historical significance like the NWA.
 "The fact that they're on Turner, again, if they're doing their homework, and I'm sure Tony [Khan] is because he's a very astute guy and he does a lot of research, there's a lot of evidence to suggest that there's a great number of fans, particularly in the South, who left the genre all together when WCW went away. I believe that the combination of their positioning on Turner and our brand and historical significance can really do a lot to bring a lot of those people back and could potentially reignite and grow the overall audience for the entire industry."
 Aldis was asked if he would be open to being the NWA representative at AEW. He said is open to it as it would provide him a stage to not only showcase NWA and the NWA Worlds Heavyweight Title but also himself. He named opponents that he would like to face but highlighted finishing the trilogy with Cody Rhodes as one that many fans have been craving for a long time.
 "Absolutely, ultimately it's about providing the stage and a platform for me to showcase myself and to showcase the title and the brand and the legacy of the NWA, but it's also about me. It's also about me trying to carve out my place in history more so than I already have," Aldis noted. "As far as opponents, obviously, the one that never goes away is the trilogy with Cody. That rivalry is just one of those things where the second that we make contact, it was just obvious that it was going to be a real significant rivalry.
 "There was just chemistry, but since the Rosa announcement, there's been a lot of a lot of talk about me and Moxley. There's been a lot of talk about me and Kenny Omega and a lot of talk about me and Jericho. That's very flattering to me because they're top guys, and I think of myself as a top guy, but ultimately, it would just be about, again, coming in and making sure that my thing, my moment felt like the most important moment in the business."

I find it virtually impossible not to see, that we as a society, are in the grip of systemic failure across the board. Stats claim that we now have a massive number of small businesses which will never reopen. Every day that failure rate grows deeper, causing a schism in our world. Since privately held businesses are the core of a community and the cogs that keep commerce moving forward, every time we lose one more Mom & Pop store, it is another nail in our coffin. America thrives as small enterprises succeed. They allow for dreams to be pursued and freedom to reign.
 Socialists, communists and anarchists rub their hands with glee while communities disintegrate and people lose hope in having a better tomorrow. Despair plays into The Agenda’s ultimate desire to have full control over every aspect of our lives. From cradle to grave and dawn to dusk — they want America to fail in a big way. It is their plan, and what The Agenda is all about. Crash the economy, regulate the remaining businesses into oblivion and crush everyone’s spirits while doing so. What was once the Democratic Party has now become exactly what our forefathers warned us about, the New Democratic Communist Party. The current crops of their leaders yield poison fruits. Fruits known as turmoil, death, chaos, theft, corruption. Which liberally litter the ground, spoiling everything they touch. And, since so many of their leaders are fully compromised by foreign entanglements, they play directly into the hands of their foreign puppet masters. The Agenda’s ultimate scheme is to vanquish America. It is always much easier to obtain absolute tyrannical control if the targeted country lay in ruins. BLM is the movements and Antifa is the muscle. BLM (via Act Blue) has now funneled well over a billion dollars into the coffers of their wicked overlords. Both BLM and Antifa have been used to terrorize entire sectors of cities, towns and neighborhoods to enforce their wicked demands. They scream with brandished fists, “Comply or else!”
 Russia, China, Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, etc. — tyrannical governments have used the auspices of chaos to break apart families, communities and institutions in order to gain absolute despotic control over their resident populations. BLM and Antifa are simply using proven techniques in order to drag America into an abyss of sorrows and pain. Tyrants are easy to spot the world over since they are total control freaks.
 This is not just another election cycle. You may not like the fact that our current resident of the White House, President Donald J. Trump, was a billionaire playboy. That he has a past of being both somewhat obnoxious and a bit crude. But, the one thing you have to admit is that he loves America! He’s an all-American natural born leader who knows how to stand up to tyrants while bringing a multitude of much needed jobs back to American’s heartland where they rightfully belong.
 Wake up! Where we go one, we go all! For if we don’t embrace being one unified America, we will be systematically picked off — it is already happening one failed business, one broken community, and one shattered dream at a time.

REEDSBURG, Wisconsin (AP) — Democrats are betting they can reach more voters without stepping outside while Republicans say political organizing in groups and face to face remains the better way, as both sides cope with reaching out to voters in the age of COVID-19. Democrats acknowledge they wish they could do more in-person campaigning, but say the coronavirus has forced them to take the neighborhood model pioneered by Barack Obama and adapt it to a public health crisis. Republicans are putting their faith in the data about Trump supporters that they have gathered, and believe that they need to reinforce the president’s appeal in person.
