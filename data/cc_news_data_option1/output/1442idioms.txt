“Nobody really is immune from this, so everybody has to be concerned about controlling this epidemic for their own sake and for society at large’s sake, but there is a broad mix of patients from every walk of life has ended up in ICU.
 “I suspect the surge hasn’t happened because the population at large has been responsible and kept their distance from each other and because people have stayed at home and behaved themselves.”
 The top consultant said 20 out of 100 patients in hospital with Covid-19 would be in ICU and could be there for up to three weeks.
 He said: “most of them would be mechanically ventilated.”
 Dr Ryan said being on a ventilator is “no trivial event” and spending a week in ICU “takes its toll on any person, no matter how healthy they were beforehand.”
 He said doctors would be “reluctant” to refer a patient to ICU if they are a resident in a nursing home and said that decision is made by medical teams and the family of the patient.

  _Airborne ranger, airborne ranger, where have you been?_
  _Around the world and back again._
  _Airborne ranger, airborne ranger, how did you get there?_
  _In a c-130 flying low._
 This is the only cadence I can remember from airborne school that is appropriate for G-rated audiences. Airborne training is a three-week course the Army uses to prepare soldiers to jump out of perfectly good airplanes.
 The main intent is to get soldiers into areas quickly that don't have easy access from the ground. The first day I didn't know what to expect and thought it would be like the first day of basic training. I was wrong on so many counts because they already assumed you were a well-oiled fighting machine.
 Which by that time is mostly the case. Once you arrive at the school you are assigned to a training unit. These are the people you will spend the next three weeks with whether you like it or not. Week one is mostly about the basics, learning to strap into the parachute and checking to ensure everyone is strapped in correctly. You also run everywhere.
 This is a slow run, almost like you are jogging in place at a fast walking cadence affectionately referred to as the airborne shuffle. This is so you build up your calf muscles and thighs. This works. By the end of the three weeks I bet I put on 15 pounds of muscle. We also had to do 10 pullups every time you walk in or out of any building.
 This doesn't sound like much but by the end of the day you have done a few hundred pullups. This is to strengthen the muscles you will need to try and slow yourself down before hitting the ground. During this time any type of muscle soother becomes your best friend and a welcome relief to this day.
 During ground week they have all kinds of simulators where they hook you up in a pretend parachute harness and have you jump out of mock doors, I bet 100,000 times. This is the swing landing trainer. It is the most uncomfortable device imaginable for a man. The straps go in-between your legs and you dangle there for what seems like hours every day.
 I thought this was so repetitive, but once you get into the door of the plane in week three, your muscle memory takes over and you go out the door without even thinking about your altitude. Week two is tower week. The Army purchased a ride from the 1939 world's fair. I didn't know how it worked then and I am not sure what the legal repercussions might have been, but they strap you into parachutes and take you up about 200 feet and release you.
 Finally comes week three, jump week. This is the pinnacle of hurry up and wait. You go to the airfield at 0'dark thirty, get in you parachutes and wait and wait, and when you think you might get to finally go, you wait more. They finally load you up in a c-130 and take off to 1,250 feet. There are massive dirt fields you jump into to try and cushion the fall for your first time. You are arranged in units called sticks while in the plane.
 When it is your turn, you stand up and shuffle out the door. When it is your turn standing in the door, I can say the fear is so bad you can almost smell it. I think it is exacerbated by the many hours of waiting it takes to get to this point. Muscle memory takes over and you are out the door before you even know it.
 The fall seems slow while you are going down peaceful and beautiful. I can see why people do this for fun. However about 30 feet from the ground you realize how fast you are going. You hardly have time to prepare and get your feet together for the parachute landing fall. This is basically gracefully hitting the dirt and rolling to try and absorb some of the impact. Feet, roll side then shoulders. There is no way to gracefully land going at these speeds and so every jump many soldiers get injured especially if you hit a tree or anything without give. I was no exception to this rule and eventually destroyed my ankle and had to have several screws other things put in there to reattach the bones to the right places. I still got my wings because even if you are injured if you gather your chute and make it to the assemble point, the jump counts.

Numerous Alamance County residents, organized by the Alamance Makers Guild, are coming together to make face shields, cloth masks and N95 mask covers for the county's hospitals and first responders.
   
 Bennett Harris, founder of the Makers Guild, estimated about 200 people are involved in the collective effort thus far, with 45 3D printers in use and several laser printers and sewers involved.
   
 Lee Atkinson, another member of the Makers Guild, is largely responsible for the idea to pull local makers together on this project, Harris said.
   
 "We've been working on this project through the Alamance County Makers Guild for a few weeks now," he said. "We had a meeting with Cone Health earlier this week, and they have now given the go-ahead."
   
 STEAM Junction in Burlington, The Forge Makerspace in Greensboro, Elon University's Maker Hub and Alamance Community College are primary partners in the effort, but individuals throughout the county with their own 3D printers, laser cutters or sewing machines also are getting involved.
   
 The collective has already produced N95 mask covers for the Burlington Fire Department. "That extend the lifetime of an N95 mask," Harris said.
   
 Mebane City Council member Sean Ewing is working with his own 3D printer to make the mask covers for the Mebane Police Department as part of the collective.
   
 "We're working initially to make 1,000 face shields for Cone Health, possibly with more after that depending on what their needs are," Harris said.
   
 Several residents are sewing cloth masks, which can be used for secondary healthcare personnel rather than front-line doctors and nurses.
   
 "We've started to give some out to downtown Burlington businesses like restaurants that are doing delivery so there is a degree of protection for folks they interact with," Harris said of the cloth masks.
   
 Completed equipment will be donated in batches of 100 to 200 as it becomes available.
   
 To ensure their own health and safety, Harris said, the makers are working as individually as possible and gathering in groups of three or fewer with adequate social distancing to assemble the face shields, N95 mask covers and cloth masks when needed.
   
 "It's difficult because under normal times, we would all get together at STEAM Junction or at Elon's Makerspace or other spaces … and do this, but every social contact is a risk for the virus, so we're working remotely and in a distributed way. Thankfully we have individual resources throughout the community," he said.
   
 "There's other things we can do down the road," Harris added. "In the Makers Guild and at STEAM Junction, we have retired electrical engineers, we have folks that repair machinery. We got a request from the hospital. Apparently they have several older machines with dead batteries, and as a result the machines won't function. … So Mark Smith [a STEAM Junction member] is working to source batteries for these machines.
   
 "There's all kinds of side efforts going on and all kinds of potential as well," he said.
   
 "We don't want to come across like we're heroes or anything. We're just trying to respond," Harris said. "This is the real value of having a makerspace in our community. … That creates this sort of micro-manufacturing industry in our community to respond to something like this."
   
 Harris said the Makers Guild also has launched a statewide effort to encourage makers across North Carolina to get involved in helping their communities.
   
 "We've started a Google Form that folks from all over the state can register to say 'Hey, I have a 3D printer or I can sew or I have other resources that could go toward solving the problem in my community.' The goal is to network people together, connect people with needs to people who can solve them," Harris said.
   
 This form also will become a resource for local makers to get involved with the collective or as a means to direct excess supplies to other communities in need after the local demand has been met.
   
 "If we fill the need in our community with face shields or others, we can send those extras off to other places like New York City or Charlotte or wherever might need them more," he said.
   
 Getting involved
   
 The Alamance Makers Guild is a nonprofit organization, which means they can accept financial donations to purchase supplies or to reimburse individual makers for supplies already purchased, Harris said.
   
 "We are doing this so nobody makes any profit off doing it," Harris explained.
   
 While other makers in the county are encouraged to join the collective, nonmakers also are able to help. Harris said financial donation or supply donations are welcome, but donors are asked to contact the Makers Guild first to find out what is needed most at that time.
   
 Donations of large space for assembly points and other resources also are needed.
   
 "If everybody suddenly donates money, we may have more money than we need locally for supplies," he explained. "We can sort of advise them, 'Yes, we still have an ongoing need' or 'No, we've got everything we need' or 'Please give your money somewhere else where there is a need, like lunches for kids who can't go to school or whatever else it is.'"
   
 To find out what makers need, email ben.harris@steamjunction.com.
   
 "What we're doing here is going on all over the country. It's a stop-gap measure until the supply chain can be restored to bring in tested, certified equipment," Harris said. "It's our hope that we get a call from the hospital tomorrow saying 'The supply chain is stable. We've got 10,000 coming in tomorrow, and we don't need you anymore.'"

Tiger Woods walked off the 18th green as a Masters champion for the fifth time, a major champion for the 15th time, and the sensation was unlike anything he had ever felt.
 More memorable than any shot -- the 8-iron that trickled by the hole at the 16th was the decisive blow -- was the purposeful stride toward his son, grabbing Charlie with both arms, lifting the boy and turning from side to side.
 His mother was next. His daughter. His loyal support staff. And then a lineup of players outside the clubhouse, some of them in green jackets. They had been upstairs in the locker room reserved for champions, yet they shared a feeling with the entire golf world.
 Memories gave way to reality.
 "That's going to be in people's minds forever," Rickie Fowler said last month, just two days before the Masters was postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Was it his biggest win?
 It would be hard to rate that over his first Masters title in 1997, a "hello, world" moment not tied to advertising. Woods set 20 records that signaled the arrival of a brand of dominance never seen in golf.
 The most historical?
 His 2001 victory at Augusta gave him a sweep of the four majors in a span of 294 days. He stands alone there.
 This was no less significant because of what it meant -- to Woods, to his sport, to peers who grew up idolizing him and to a worldwide audience that had reason to believe it might never happen again.
 "I had just an amazing amount of emails and texts that were flowing in," Woods said in a conference call leading up to the Masters. "But I was more surprised by the amount of videos of people watching the Masters and seeing their reaction when I hit the shot on 16 or when I made the putt, whether it was on airplanes or in airports or restaurants.
 "The amount of emotion that people were showing, that's what blew my mind."
 That's what made this Masters different from his other four, this major different from the other 14.
 Adam Scott doesn't usually stick around when he's finished with a major. One exception was in 2006 after the U.S. Open at Winged Foot when he was headed for the airport and turned around when close friend Geoff Ogilvy emerged the winner.
 He finished Sunday at Augusta National about the time all hell broke loose at Amen Corner.
 "You got a sense, as he was kind of taking the lead on the back nine, that something special could be happening," Scott said. "There was a lot of guys watching in the champion's locker room and I stayed and watched. You don't often get that group of people together very often. You just had that sense it's a significant moment in the sport again."
 Gary Woodland wasn't about to miss it.
 "I don't usually watch much golf," he said. "I had my family there. I was flying out Sunday afternoon. I played early that day, and we pushed the flight back. I wanted to watch that."
 The only mystery is where it leads.
 Woods was never the same the rest of the major season. He played nine holes of practice at Bethpage Black and missed the cut in the PGA Championship. He was never a factor at the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach, site of his 15-shot victory, as untouchable as any of his records. He missed the cut at the British Open.
 Woods had another knee surgery to repair minor cartilage damage. And then he won again, this time in Japan, to tie the PGA Tour's victory record with No. 82.
 In only two starts this year, in chilly California weather, he didn't look like the Masters champion. His back felt stiff and he skipped three tournaments he ordinarily plays. And now golf is shut down, which Woods said has given him time for his 44-year-old body to feel stronger.
 He had caddie Joe LaCava come down a month after the Masters to watch the final round together. Woods has watched that Masters plenty of times, and he taped a segment with Jim Nantz for perspective unlike any other for CBS to show it again Sunday to fill the void of not having the Masters this April.
 Each time Woods won a major -- even the first of his 15 -- it was one major closer to the 18 won by Jack Nicklaus. This one was different. This was more about satisfaction and redemption than a thirst for more.
 Woods said his kids once looked at him as the "YouTube" golfer because they never saw him at his best.
 They were at Carnoustie in the summer of 2018 when he had the lead briefly in the final round of the British Open. They were with him at Augusta National, and that meant as much as the green jacket he wore -- the jacket, he said, they fought over who could wear it on the flight home.
 "It's been incredible for myself and my family to be a part of this, and for me to be the current Masters champion, it's crazy that somehow it all came together for one week," he said. "One magical week."

Gianluigi Buffon has endorsed Juventus' bid to sign AC Milan star Gianluigi Buffon as the Italy great nears retirement.
 Buffon is out of contract at the end of 2018 and the 39-year-old veteran is tipped to hang up his gloves following next year's World Cup in Russia.
 The iconic keeper, though, wants to go out on a high after suffering a third Champions League final loss, this time against Real Madrid in Cardiff.
 However, Buffon has welcomed the challenge of teenage sensation Donnarumma and Arsenal's Wojciech Szczesny – who have been linked with moves to the Serie A champions.
 "To me, they seem to be the right choices," the Italy goalkeeper told reporters ahead of Sunday's World Cup qualifier against Liechtenstein.
 "Well, I've always been, I believe, a reasonable person who tries to understand the meaning of things. And it is right that Juve try to sign a goalkeeper like him, it is right that our national team has goalkeepers like these, in this case one like Gigio Donnarumma.
 "Because in the end you make progress because of your merits, and as I always say a coach has to choose his formation to win the game, and should only think about that. It's right that it works this way," Buffon continued. "This means that for me it's a great incentive, because I know that even if I'm 39 or 40 years old if want to keep a certain prestige, a certain role, I have to work hard.
 "The day I don't want to work hard anymore I'll just stay at home, because – inevitably – goalkeepers like Szczesny, like Donnarumma or like [Alex] Meret are regulars. They're number ones, and they are because of their merits, and not because of somebody else's favour.
 "I am not eternal and I never thought that I was," Buffon added. "I think of the group, so Juventus and the Nazionale quite rightly have to plan beyond the individual.
 "I said in the past that I might not want to be a coach, but perhaps a CT at international level would be less stressful on a daily basis. When I do retire, I'd like to rest a little bit, as it has been a long and intense career."

Unlike the opening two stanzas at the Watkins Glen and Barber Motorsports Park road course layouts, the two-mile, D-shaped oval should see a new set of challengers steal the headlines. How Sage Karam of Dreyer & Reinbold Racing and Team Penske's Scott McLaughiln deal with the new surroundings will be the primary focus. Prior to the selection of Watkins Glen as the opening venue, which was done via a fan vote, the Nazareth, Pennsylvania based Karambwas notable for not being keen about starting the series on an oval track. That feeling was shown in full force at the upstate New York venue where he won from the pole position and he seemed to be on the verge of happening again last Saturday in Alabama, until contact with Chip Ganassi Racing's Felix Rosenqvist halted his progress. With Karam out of the picture, it was McLaughlin, the multi-time Australian SuperCars title holder who took over the point, via a cleverly planned pit stop strategy. Although seemingly home free after wresting the lead from Andretti Autosport's Scott Speed, the relative newcomer to IndyCar competition still had to hold a determined teammate in Will Power to score the triumph. Like Karam, the New Zealander is limited in high-speed oval action, but he has shown to be a fast learner in other IRacing formats.

Couples are often told to prepare for anything when it comes to their wedding, but a global pandemic isn't typically something to consider.
 Now that most Americans have been ordered to stay at home and avoid nonessential travel to slow the spread of the coronavirus, many couples -- including those who were only days or weeks away from getting married -- have had to abruptly postpone their special day, while many others are in limbo, unsure of how to proceed.
 "Postponing our wedding has opened up an entire different category of stress that I didn't know was possible," says Allison Hayes, a newly unemployed hairstylist in Ohio who delayed her May wedding.
 The scale of postponements is also unprecedented for vendors and planners.
 "We've never seen such major sweeping postponements in the wedding industry," says Renee Dalo, owner and lead wedding planner of Moxie Bright Events in Los Angeles. Dalo has already rescheduled six weddings and expects that number to grow.
 "It was a lot of stress in a really short amount of time," says Elliott San, a Los Angeles-based screenwriter who moved his March wedding to November. "It felt like 48 hours of crisis management response."
 In addition to the logistical headache of moving a tightly coordinated event at the eleventh hour, there are also potential financial implications for couples. Some may lose deposits with vendors; others are suddenly without jobs and are juggling wedding payments with other bills.
 Here are a few things to keep in mind if you and your partner are in a similar predicament.
 LOOK FOR WAYS TO PARE BACK
 If the pandemic has had an impact on your wages, the wedding will likely need to take a back seat to more pressing needs.
 The hair salon where Hayes works has been shuttered temporarily, so she is also feeling anxiety about paying for the wedding.
 "My partner and I had been budgeting and saving our money to pay for a significant portion of our wedding costs, but we just lost the weekly payments my income was putting into our wedding account," she says.
 If your job has been affected, take steps to get control of your finances in the short-term. Look into expanded unemployment benefits as a way to help cover things like rent or groceries. Your bills should take priority over wedding plans. If money is an issue, Dalo suggests contacting vendors directly to see if you can split up payments moving forward.
 "If a client came to me asking to make smaller, more spread out payments, I would be 100% on board with that," she says. "We're all doing what we can to stay afloat and navigate the crisis together."
 Regardless of your current job situation, it's a good time to reevaluate wedding costs that haven't already been paid and see where you could scale back, if necessary.
 Hayes now plans to cut back on decorations. She had been holding off on purchasing them and has decided to have fewer since she'll have less time to decorate on her new date.
 "I was financially confident at the beginning of wedding planning, but I work in freelance and have lost a lot of opportunities," says Katy Colloton, an actress and screenwriter in Los Angeles. Colloton says she was originally planning to "go all-out" with things like table favors, bridal party gifts and welcome bags, but will adjust her approach if the job market continues to decline.
 CONTACT YOUR VENUE
 Vendors, planners and couples all agree that if you're in the process of postponing, your first call or email should be to the venue.
 "Get in contact with the venue first since that is the biggest investment, then get in touch with vendors to see how everything aligns," says Laura Yap, who runs a floral business in Austin, Texas.
 Dalo echoes this advice, but notes that venues may have different approaches depending on their contract and schedule.
 "One private club is switching the wedding to another Saturday with no fees, while another venue has asked for a $7,000 surcharge to keep it on a Saturday," she says. "It really depends on the venue."
 San says his Palm Springs venue was understanding and accommodating, while Hayes laments that hers had only two days open for the rest of 2020 -- and one was the day after Christmas.
 Start those conversations with your venue as soon as possible and try to be realistic. If you're set on not paying any more than you already have, you may have to make some trade-offs.
 "Some venues can't give you another Saturday, but they'll give you a Friday or Sunday," Dalo says. "I think that's a good compromise."
 START PRIORITIZING VENDORS
 While many vendors are trying to be flexible, the reality is that they may not all be available on your new date, especially as more weddings are rescheduled for fall and winter.
 "We have paid nonrefundable deposits for all of our vendors, and the most stressful part is trying to either line all of them up or choose which ones to take a loss with and potentially hire someone else," Hayes says.
 Delia Turner, a criminal attorney in Missouri, wasn't able to keep her photographer and hair and makeup artist. "The photographer is a good friend of mine, but she wasn't available. She will subcontract someone for me. I also lost a $100 deposit on a hair and makeup artist."
 As you begin the postponement process, prioritize the vendors that matter the most to you as you work with your venue to find a new date. Cost could be a factor -- replacing a videographer will likely be more expensive than finding a new hair and makeup artist -- but also keep in mind that your vendors are dealing with personal and professional upheaval now, too.
 "Remember that everyone is human. Small-business owners have already invested so much work, and half of that work is administrative," says Yap, who is temporarily pivoting to weekly flower deliveries to maintain a positive cash flow. "Spring is my largest season. I had ramped up with staffing and invested time into planning, so I'm figuring out how to make that all work."
 CHECK OUT WEDDING INSURANCE
 "Our biggest regret is not purchasing wedding insurance," says Crystal Ramirez, whose New Orleans wedding was postponed a week before she and her fiance lost their jobs. (She was an industrial insulator and he worked at an oil refinery.)
 If your wedding is several weeks or months away, you may have time to get wedding insurance. There are two main types of coverage, liability insurance and cancellation or postponement coverage, and you can get one or both. Some venues already require liability insurance, but Dalo recommends taking the extra step of getting cancellation insurance as well.
 However, be sure to read the fine print and consult your insurance provider. Whether cancellation coverage will reimburse events postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak may depend on city and state restrictions.
 "One of my client's cancellation coverage kicked in once the shelter-in-place order became mandatory. A recommendation from the local government wouldn't cover it, but a mandate did," she says.
 Continue to keep an eye on restrictions in the location where you're getting married and contact your insurance providers directly with any questions.
 KEEP THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE
 It's upsetting to have to reschedule an event you've been planning for months or even years, but make sure you're giving yourself mental space to concentrate on your day-to-day needs.
 For San, that means shifting focus to his fiancee Emily, who is returning to her job as a nurse after taking some time off for their now-delayed wedding.
 "Once the dust settled and we rescheduled, we pivoted to being more concerned about her going back to the hospital. I have something new to worry about besides this wedding," he says.
 Ultimately, it also helps to maintain some perspective and know you're not alone. Some couples are finding comfort in realizing they have a lot to be thankful for.
 "Remember what's important: your health and your family and friends' health," Colloton says. "A wedding is a special day, but it's one day and one party. This seems so small compared to what is happening in the world."

WILMINGTON ISLAND, Ga. (WTOC) -Easter traditions have had to change for many this year due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Families weren’t able to go to church, do large Easter egg hunts or even be with some family members.Two Wilmington Island families said waking up on Sunday morning was extremely different.Typically the Roberts family and Peters family say they would have gotten dressed up and went to mass before taking part in their other holiday traditions. One family says this new way of celebrating has come with many positives, but even with the “new” way of celebrating, some things were hard to come to terms with having to miss.“It’s actually been nice to just watch church online and pick what churches we want to watch and not have the pressure of all day long being on a schedule," said Tonya Roberts. "Just being able to sit with them and enjoy them.”Copyright 2020 WTOC. All rights reserved.

“Had Dundee voted the proposals through then that cash would have been in bank accounts by Tuesday morning. Of course, Dundee could cast their vote at any moment but in the meantime the SPFL board has to look examine every alternative.
 “We expect a board meeting will be called in the next 24 hours and these urgent discussions will begin.”
 The move comes on the back of an unprecedented and punishing weekend for the game which saw Rangers effectively declaring war on the governing body by calling for the suspension of chief executive Neil Doncaster and legal adviser Rod McKenzie.
 The Ibrox club claims to be in possession of proof of serious foul play the at the very top of the game and has demanded an immediate independent inquiry.
 But that provoked a stinging rebuke from SPFL chairman Murdoch MacLennan who wrote to all 42 clubs in an attempt to ‘set the record straight’.
 In the letter Murdoch said: “I have seen allegations made by the Rangers FC Interim Chairman Douglas Park, in a statement issued by Rangers at 3pm on Saturday, about the SPFL, its corporate governance, its culture, its office- bearers and its business operations.
 “I wrote to Mr Park on Saturday evening, requesting any material to support these allegations. I regret to inform you that, at the time of writing, I have received nothing from Mr Park. It is difficult to understand why Mr Park should not wish to share this alleged material with me.
 “I am entirely satisfied, based on all the information at my disposal, that the SPFL and its executives and legal advisers have acted wholly properly at every stage in this process.

Clubs hoping to sign Leonardo Bonucci may be disappointed after Massimiliano Allegri anointed the Italy defender as "the future leader of the Juventus dressing room".
 Bonucci is rumoured to be a target for the Chelsea side led by his former Juve and Italy boss Antonio Conte, as well as long-term admirer Pep Guardiola at Manchester City.
 The 30-year-old centre-back was dropped by Allegri for disciplinary reasons in the first leg of the Champions League round-of-16 tie against Porto in February, having argued with his coach on the touchline during a 4-1 Serie A victory over Palermo.
 "At that particular moment it was the right thing to do," Allegri told Sky Italia.
 "There are times when you should turn a blind eye and times when you have to have your eyes wide open and in that moment Leo was wrong.
 "I was wrong too, and in fact I punished myself and Leo was left out. It was an important and decisive game [against Porto] and even if we'd lost we'd have had the strength to win 10 more."
 Suitors planning to capitalise of any discord between player and coach could find themselves frustrated during the close-season, though, after Bonucci earned glowing praise from his boss.
 "We played a good game against Porto and then after two days Bonucci came back, because he's an important player, an extraordinary player and above all he has to understand that he'll be the future leader of the Juventus dressing room," Allegri said.

Guest columns share an author's personal perspective.
 Quite understandably, much of the current discourse surrounding the COVID-19 crisis pertains to the physical health implications of the virus. Yet amid the rise of quarantine restrictions and social distancing practices, severe gaps in mental health care and support systems also represent a substantial concern.
 Just the mere thought of coronavirus can be anxiety-provoking for a person without an existing mental health diagnosis. For people with mental illness, the stress and fear associated with a rapidly spreading pandemic is exponentially more precarious, and can exacerbate an existing mental health or substance use problem.
 Long before the coronavirus outbreak, governments and other institutions were largely failing to protect at-risk individuals from a mental health perspective. Police officers and firefighters -- whose PTSD and depression rates are as much as five times higher than the rates within the civilian population -- are more likely to die by suicide than in the line of duty.
 The medical staffs working around the clock to treat patients with COVID-19, as well as a 'regular' patient base, are also being put under greater stress and anxiety while performing their duties as they try to balance treatment and not catching the virus or passing it on.
 At the same time, mental health disabilities are increasingly pervasive on college campuses. The American College Health Association found in 2018 that 40% of undergraduates had felt so depressed within the previous 12 months that it was difficult for them to function, while more than 10% of undergraduates had seriously considered suicide during the same period.
 Additionally, four of the eight Ivy League schools prohibit students from visiting campus while they are on leave. This means that students who are taking time away from the academic demands in order to focus on their own well-being become socially isolated, as they are banned from coming to campus to share a meal with friends.
 Now, as schools shut down for the remainder of the semester and social distancing measures are implemented nationwide in order to curb the spread of coronavirus, even the imperfect safe haven of a college campus community is no longer available to students with mental health conditions. International students, many of whom cannot return home due to travel restrictions, are even more isolated at this time. With this country's health care system bracing for the strain of a novel pandemic, who will step in to care for these vulnerable individuals?
 Philanthropy must answer the call by catalyzing the discussion, increasing resources, and destigmatizing the mental health conversation. Along these lines, the Newton and Boston-based Ruderman Family Foundation has a proven infrastructure already in place.
 The foundation partnered with This Is My Brave, an organization that has speakers tell their stories of dealing with their mental health in a storytelling format, to present "This Is My Brave College Edition." The performances featured nine college students from Boston campuses who performed their stories at Lesley University, Harvard University, Northeastern University and Tufts University this past fall, and performed this spring at Boston University, Brandeis University and at the Ivy League Medical Conference at Harvard Medical School.
 We also partner with BRYT: Bridge for Resilient Youth in Transition, a program providing assistance for students to come back to school after an absence for treatment of a mental health diagnosis. Students re-entering school can feel overwhelmed, and this program helps to alleviate some of that apprehension. Each BRYT program approaches staffing, space, and services with a consistent vision, while customizing the specifics for each school population and for each student. This rapidly expanding program will undoubtedly be in greater demand when students are allowed to assimilate back on campus.
 Raising awareness and making a statement on a more national scale, we honored decorated swimmer Michael Phelps with the 2018 Morton E. Ruderman Award in Inclusion for his open discussion of his struggle with depression and anxiety.
 Currently, our organization is in the process of assessing how to specifically mobilize our resources on mental health care and support in response to COVID-19. In a world increasingly defined by isolation, we will not leave this vulnerable population behind.

SINT-PIETERS BRUGGE, Belgium -- Master chocolatier Dominique Persoone stood forlorn on his huge workfloor, a faint smell of cocoa lingering amid the idle machinery -- in a mere memory of better times.
   
 Easter Sunday is normally the most important date on the chocolate makers' calendar. But the coronavirus pandemic, with its lockdowns and social distancing, has struck a hard blow to the 5-billion-euro ($5.5-billion) industry that's one of Belgium's most emblematic.
   
 "It's going to be a disaster," Persoone told The Associated Press through a medical mask. He closed his shops as a precautionary measure weeks ago, and says "a lot" of Belgium's hundreds of chocolate-makers, from multinationals to village outlets, will face financial ruin.
   
 For the coronavirus to hit is one thing, but to do it at Easter -- when chocolate bunnies and eggs are seemingly everywhere -- doubles the damage.
   
 Yet amid the general gloom Belgians are allowing themselves some levity for the long Easter weekend.
   
 Some producers, like Persoone's famed The Chocolate Line, offer Easter eggs or bunnies in medical masks, while the country's top virologist has jokingly granted a lockdown pass to the "essential" furry workers traditionally supposed to bring kids their Easter eggs.
   
 For young and old here, Easter Sunday usually means egg hunts in gardens and parks, sticky brown fingers, the satisfying crack of an amputated chocolate rabbit's ear before it disappears into a rapt child's mouth.
   
 "People love their chocolates, the Easter eggs, the filled eggs, the little figures we make," said chocolatier Marleen Van Volsem in her Praleen shop in Halle, south of Brussels. "This is really something very big for us."
   
 The country has an annual per capita chocolate consumption of six kilograms (over 13 pounds), much of it scoffed during the peak Easter period.
   
 "It is a really big season because if we don't have this, then we won't … be OK for the year," Van Volsem said.
   
 Persoone makes about 20% of his annual turnover in the single Easter week. This year, reduced to web sales and pick-ups out of his facility in western Belgium while his luxury shops in tourist cities Bruges and Antwerp are closed? "2% maybe, if we are lucky -- not even."
   
 Guy Gallet, chief of Belgium's chocolate federation, expects earnings to be greatly reduced across the board this year.
   
 He said companies that sell mainly through supermarkets are doing relatively well but firms depending on sales in tourist locations, restaurants or airport shops "are badly hit."
   
 Persoone has a firm local base of customers but knows how tourists affect the books of so many chocolatiers.
   
 "Of course, we won't see Japanese people or Americans who come to Belgium for a holiday," he said. "I am afraid if we do not get tourists anymore it will be a disaster, even in the future."
   
 For most people, the coronavirus causes mild to moderate symptoms such as fever and cough. But for some, especially older adults and the infirm, it can cause pneumonia and in some cases death.
   
 The immediate challenge is to keep the Easter spirit -- and the chocolatiers' craft -- alive in these trying times.
   
 A big part is humor and the use of medical masks made of white chocolate is an obvious one. Persoone puts them on eggs.
   
 "It is laughing with a hard thing. And on the other hand, we still have to keep fun, no? It is important to laugh in life."
   
 Genevieve Trepant of the Cocoatree chocolate shop in Lonzee, southeast of Brussels, couldn't agree more. And like Persoone, who donated sanitary gel no longer needed in his factory to a local hospital, Trepant also thought of the needy.
   
 That's how the Lapinou Solidaire and its partner the Lapinou Confine -- the Caring Bunny and the Quarantined Bunny, both adorned with a white mask -- were born. Customers are encouraged to gift Trepant's 12-euro ($13) bunnies to local medical staff to show their support. Part of the proceeds go to charity.
   
 One of the country's top coronavirus experts also knows the medical virtues of laughter. Professor Marc Van Ranst told Belgian children that their Easter treats weren't at risk.
   
 Tongue well in cheek, he told public broadcaster VRT that the government had deeply pondered the issue of delivery rabbits' movements in these dangerous times. The rabbits bring -- Santa-like -- eggs to the gardens of children, roving all over Belgium at a time when it is forbidden for the public at large.
   
 "The decision was unanimous: it is an essential profession. Even the police have been informed that they should not obstruct the Easter bunny in its work," he said.
   
 There was a proviso, though.
   
 "Rabbits will deliver to the homes of parents, not grandparents," who are more at risk from COVID-19, Van Ranst said.

After two unexpected winners to open the 2020 IndyCar IRacing Challenge, 31 drivers are expected to participate Saturday as the online exhibition circus heads to virtual Michigan International Speedway for the Chevrolet 275. Unlike the opening two stanzas at the Watkins Glen and Barber Motorsports Park road course layouts, the two-mile, D-shaped oval should see a new set of challengers steal the headlines. How Sage Karam of Dreyer & Reinbold Racing and Team Penske's Scott McLaughiln deal with the new surroundings will be the primary focus. Prior to the selection of Watkins Glen as the opening venue, which was done via a fan vote, the Nazareth, Pennsylvania based Karambwas notable for not being keen about starting the series on an oval track. That feeling was shown in full force at the upstate New York venue where he won from the pole position and he seemed to be on the verge of happening again last Saturday in Alabama, until contact with Chip Ganassi Racing's Felix Rosenqvist halted his progress. With Karam out of the picture, it was McLaughlin, the multi-time Australian SuperCars title holder who took over the point, via a cleverly planned pit stop strategy. Although seemingly home free after wresting the lead from Andretti Autosport's Scott Speed, the relative newcomer to IndyCar competition still had to hold a determined teammate in Will Power to score the triumph. Like Karam, the New Zealander is limited in high-speed oval action, but he has shown to be a fast learner in other IRacing formats. If questions linger about what Karam and McLaughlin could achieve at Michigan, the scenarios could be tailor-made for Power, who two years ago broke through to win the Indianapolis 500. Although in literally a similar trench in terms of high speed ovals early in his IndyCar tenure, the Aussie has been one of the best on the left-hander only result earners over the past three seasons. While the chauffeur of the No. 12 Verizon Chevrolet is perhaps the leader of the old guard, he may not the lone veteran to fly the flag on Saturday. Arch-rival Scott Dixon made solid progress in his maiden IRacing voyage in Alabama last week and could be a step ahead of most, considering he is one of the few drivers to actually race an IndyCar at MIS in real-life. Two other hard chargers who also fit into this elite club are A.J. Foyt Racing's Tony Kanaan and owner-driver Ed Carpenter. The Brazilian is still learning the nuances of IRacing in general, but could be aided on a track type that he has excelled upon since joining SuperTex's organization in 2018. Carpenter, the native of Indianapolis, survived his trial by fire in online racing this past week, earning praise after a hotly contested test event at virtual Indianapolis Motor Speedway, running in the top-five until being collected in a late-race accident in turn four. A more focused attitude toward the IRacing Challenge compared to some could allow the three-time Indy 500 pole winner to enjoy a breakout effort after 275 miles. Several drivers new to the virtual IndyCar world this week are Andretti Autosport's Ryan Hunter-Reay, who takes the wheel of his own No. 28 DHL Honda, after the team's Indy Lights Presented By Cooper Tires prospect Kyle Kirkwood flew the colors in the opening two efforts. RHR's teammate Marco Andretti also will make his 2020 IRacing debut at Michigan Saturday, after getting his feet wet in the same virtual Indy test race that featured the aforementioned Ed Carpenter. The No. 98 entry joins round three with some momentum after Scott Speed's solid top-five showing last week in Alabama. However, the majority of race fans tuning into NBCSN's coverage of the event will be greatly interested in the progress of former NASCAR Cup star Dale Earnhardt, Jr., who will try his luck in an open-wheel car for the first time on Saturday. The two-time Daytona 500 champion takes over the stock car representation from Jimmie Johnson, who entered his No. 48 Chevrolet in both events at Watkins Glen and Alabama to open the virtual exhibition league. While high speed action will be expected on Saturday, the aggressive nature of IndyCar IRacing action on the ovals in recent trial events not associated with the actual exhibition league, seem to tip the hand that cautions could dominate the proceedings. The 250-mile test race at the Brickyard was filled with extended pace truck action, as was a 500-kilometer at World Wide Technology Raceway near St. Louis held a day after the Watkins Glen opener. If a similar story line takes hold at Michigan, track position and pit strategy could ultimately determine the winner, along with simply surviving the drama.

Bayern Munich president Uli Hoeness has appeared to confirm reports Bayern Munich have dropped their interest in Arsenal star Alexis Sanchez by saying the club would be wrong to sign experienced players for €100million.
 Sanchez only has one year left on his contract at the Emirates Stadium and has been heavily linked with the German champions, along with Manchester City.
 But after claims Bayern had ended their pursuit over concerns about the transfer fee and wages involved, Hoeness seemed to back that stance by suggesting his side's focus was on signing and developing younger talent.
 "We are all talking about a reconstruction and about planning Bayern Munich's future," Hoeness said to Kicker.
 "Then we do that, signing young players between 20 and 22 - and there are critics again. But you cannot reconstruct a team by signing 29 or 30-year-old players for €100m. That is no policy.
 "Either we go all the way with all these young lads, and then they need to have the chance to play, or we don't go it.
 "I fully support what has been done so far, it is highly satisfactory and makes sense. Niklas Sule, Sebastian Rudy, Serge Gnabry and Corentin Tolisso are players with huge potential for the future."
 Hoeness believes the criticism of Renato Sanches, who started only six league games in his first season after joining from Benfica for €35m, in a deal that could reach €80m, from Benfica, proves his point.
 "We should try it one more year, we need to stay calm," he said.
 "This lad wasn't able to play three or four games without pressure.
 "You need to trust young players more, even if we are only Bundesliga champions the next two years and have to see what is possible internationally.
 "But afterwards we will make the crossover and lead Bayern into the future."

 A fellow church goer and friend told me, however, he drove to pick up a bundle only to find that the Newton Police Department told the pastor he could not provide palm for the members of the congregation in sterilized small packages.
   
 I can support our bishop's decision to close the churches until this coronavirus scourge is over, but stopping the passing out of a sacramental under the conditions prepared by the pastor seems like overkill.
   
 My own opinion of police departments, state and local has been high with family members serving in both World Wars and later becoming police officers.
   
 I served in the U.S. Navy aboard an ammunition ship and sleeping every night with 20,000 tons of ammunition on board was good preparation for later life as a school superintendent.
   
 So my experience with police and service personnel was somewhat extensive and very positive. That does not mean someone can't make an error in judgment.
   
 I would appreciate the opinion of Judge Napolitano on the case of the Palm Sunday endeavor at St. Joseph's Church. His writing is as good as it gets because he certainly understands constitutional law.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- For years, personal trainer Amanda Tikalsky didn't have to worry much about her job. The U.S. economy's record-breaking 11-year expansion offered security to service workers like her.


  Then came the coronavirus, which closed the Milwaukee athletic club where she worked for 15 years. She scrambled to organize online exercise sessions to keep money coming in. About 25% of her clients made the jump with her.


  "It's an adjustment for everybody,'' she said. "We are used to being face to face."


  But even when the virus threat is gone, Tikalsky predicts that many customers will continue to exercise from home. The shutdown is also likely to change her own shopping habits. She has a new appreciation for the ease of buying groceries online.


  The pandemic is almost sure to leave a mark on the way people work, shop and socialize, perhaps permanently shifting the way many service industries operate. Consumers will think harder about the health implications of squeezing into crowded restaurants and movie theaters. More businesses will accept the effectiveness of employees who work from home, and the move to online shopping will accelerate.


  "We've never had a crisis where we couldn't socially gather with people," said John Gordon, founder of Pacific Management Consulting Group in San Diego, which advises restaurants.


  Until March, service workers -- from dishwashers to real estate agents -- had been enjoying a record winning streak in the job market. U.S. service jobs had risen for a decade.


  The sector appeared almost immune to blips in the economy. Not even low-wage competition overseas or automation seemed to threaten service jobs that require direct contact with customers.


  Then the virus arrived. It upended the service economy, which accounts for 84% of U.S. private-sector employment. It wiped out 659,000 service jobs in March -- 94% of the jobs that vanished last month as the U.S. economy plunged into recession.


  It is sure to claim many more. In an interview on CNBC, former Fed Chair Janet Yellen predicted that unemployment rates could climb to Great Depression levels. But because the economy was in solid shape before the outbreak, she added, the return to normal employment could happen much faster than during the Depression or after the 2007-2009 Great Recession.


  When the economy goes into a nosedive, manufacturers, not services providers, are usually hit first and hardest.


  Not this time. The virus has been a gut punch to businesses that depend on social gatherings -- restaurants, cinemas, theaters, hotels, airlines, gyms, shopping centers. More than 250,000 stores are now temporarily closed, accounting for nearly 60% of retail square footage, according to Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, a research firm.


  The situation is similar in many other countries. In Wuhan, China, where the viral outbreak began, consumers are still reluctant to go out shopping as conditions slowly head back to normal.


  Josh Rivas is among the millions of job casualties in the U.S. He works at a Subway at a rest stop in Connecticut where he and co-workers were laid off because of the virus amid dwindling traffic at the plaza. "We can't afford for us to miss a day of pay because we have families that we need to take care of and bills we need to pay," he said.


  In recessions, factories are often the first to slash jobs, and they don't always bring them back. American manufacturers still employ 918,000 fewer workers than they did before the Great Recession. Over the same period, service employment is up by nearly 14 million.


  Economists are divided over whether service employees will face the kind of economic disruption factory workers have endured.


  Much depends on the rescue efforts being put together by the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve. Congress and the White House are throwing at least $2.2 trillion at American businesses and households in a desperate attempt to keep them from going under before the health crisis is over.


  "As long as we do the policy right, we should get a pretty strong recovery," said Heidi Shierholz, senior economist at the liberal Economic Policy Institute and former chief economist at the Labor Department. "When the lockdown is over, I think we'll get a pretty decent bounce back."


  Shierholz does not expect a "transformative'' change to service sector jobs.


  Still, some effects of the outbreak are likely to linger, analysts say.


  Cooped up in their homes, Americans have discovered anew the convenience of shopping online -- something that is likely to accelerate the decline of traditional retail stores, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at the accounting and consulting firm Grant Thornton.


  Restaurants have closed their dining rooms and reduced service to takeout, delivery and curbside pickup. Swonk expects the trend toward grab-and-go dining to continue after the health crisis.


  Restaurant consultant Gordon predicts that local governments will reduce restaurant seating capacity to keep diners from being on top of each other. "Some of the places we used to go were just armpit to armpit. Can you see us doing that now?'' he said.


  Millions of Americans have spent weeks working from home, and the experience has been eye-opening for many, and for their bosses. Meetings and even virtual after-hours cocktail parties can be organized on Zoom, WhatsApp or other programs.


  "We're just discovering that we can have amazing seminars and conferences online much easier. We don't have to travel anywhere," said Arindrajit Dube, economist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. That's troubling for airlines and hotels that depend on business travel, sometimes to subsidize discounts for leisure travelers.


  The enhanced appeal of home offices could also have implications for real estate markets, giving more workers expanded housing options because they won't need to travel to their jobs.


  But there may be limits to Americans' enthusiasm for isolating themselves at home.


  Becky Ahlgren Bedics, 49, of Fishers, Indiana, has been working out via Zoom since her fitness club closed temporarily in mid-March. But she plans to trek over to the club when it reopens. She misses the camaraderie. "There's such a connection that you have with people," she added.

Police are now investigating possible criminal charges against the operator, Princess Cruises, for misleading authorities about the situation. (The ship has since been allowed to dock at Port Kembla, south of Sydney, with a fifth of more than 1,000 crew quarantined aboard showing virus-like symptoms.)
 There are also calls for a criminal negligence investigation of the operator of the Artania, in a weeks-long stand-off in West Australian waters.
 Most of the ship's passengers were allowed to disembark and get charter flights home to Europe. But more than 400 people, mostly crew, remain on board, and the State Government fears the number of coronavirus cases would overwhelm local hospitals.
 "We'd like you to leave, we don't want you in our port," said West Australian Premier Mark McGowan.
 But where are they, and tens of thousands of crew workers on hundreds of other cruise ships around the world, to go?
 ## Caribbean tax shelters
 Consider the Artania. The ship is owned by British cruise line P&O, chartered to a German company, operates out of Frankfurt and is registered in the Bahamas.
 The Ruby Princess operates out of Australia but is registered in Bermuda. Its owner, Princess Cruises, is headquartered in California but also incorporated in Bermuda.
 Most cruise ships are registered in a country different to ownership or operation. More than two-thirds (by tonnage) fly the flags of just three nations — the Bahamas, Panama and Bermuda.

Animated shows have come a long way since The Simpsons first started haven't they? Duncanville is a show that might turn some folks off and make others laugh uproariously depending on just what a person finds funny and how willing they are to keep watching. It's definitely on a slightly different wavelength than other shows such as The Simpsons and Family Guy, but not by so much that it distances itself in such a huge way. Duncanville is a bit odd in a manner that's hard to explain since animated series these days kind of have to find a path that hasn't been walked upon that often and go with it in an attempt to find their own way to notoriety and possible fame. So far though the show has managed to gain a great deal of attention according to Tommy Williams of GeekTyrant and has been given the green light for another season already. That alone tells a person that whoever needed to be impressed was more than willing to take another shot on this show and has enough faith that the second season will be every bit as good if not better. Of course we're going to have to wait and see to find out whether that's true, but at this point one can't help but think that there might be a new era of animated series coming, and that the ones that have been around for a while are going to be on constant notice to keep up their current pace or let a new show move on up.

Give a little boy a stick of some sort and a ball and they can play for hours. It might wind up with stitches and bruises, but, hey, they’ve entertained themselves all afternoon.
 It reminded me of my little boys and how much fun they had playing in the back of the pickup truck with long sticks. Once when I was babysitting with another little boy, one of my boys hit him with a stick, no stitches required, and his mother was quite upset with me. I had no answer but “boys with be boys.”
 A couple of weeks later my son, the hitter, was hit with a stick by the former hittee, and showed up at the door with a little stream of blood dripping down his forehead. I was literally so happy and couldn’t wait to tell the mother of the hittee that her little darling had hit mine.
 And that’s the attitude you need as a mother of many boys.
 Now I get to video chat my grandsons. One of them, McCoy, an adorable 4-year- old blond, is particularly active and talkative. That boy can talk. He is at home with his mom and dad, who are mostly working from home, and a baby sister.
 My son posted a video last week in which the baby was in her baby jumper thing, twirling herself around and around in circles.
 “This has been my life for the past few weeks,” my son said in a rather discouraged monotone.
 But in the background, McCoy dashed back and forth in a shirt and underwear, holding something stick like and jumping on and off the couch.
 “He hasn’t worn pants for 15 days,” my son continued in the same discouraged monotone.
 But the next time I videoed them he had on pants. But no shirt.

Based on region, the cannabis cultivation market is segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and MEA. North America dominated the global market in 2018 and is anticipated to grow at a lucrative CAGR over the forecast period. This is due to presence of two largest legalized markets- the U.S. and Canada. The U.S. has a high consumption rate owing to legal acceptance of marijuana, whereas Canada is a major cultivator and exporter of cash crop, thereby significantly contributing toward the global cultivation. This is further driven by the presence of high marijuana businesses in the region. These players have significantly increased their cultivation capabilities in tandem to increasing marijuana demand. For instance, in 2018, Canopy Growth Corporation-a cannabis-producing company based in Ontario-has tripled its cultivation capacity to over 2.4 million sq ft. The company is also planning to expand its cultivation space to more than 5 million sq ft by the end of 2019. In addition, these countries have also legalized both forms of marijuana use (i.e., medical & recreational), which is expected to considerably increase product adoption.

"We played some tough teams earlier on and scrimmages that were really tough, hoping to toughen them up," he said.
 Onteora clinched the division by defeating Spackenkill on Jan. 27, then turned around the next night for a tough game against a Class A Saugerties team, taking the Sawyers down to the wire before losing.
 "That was a big turning point in the season," Occhi noted. "Tied with three minutes to go against obviously a pretty strong team. We lost, but seeing that they could play with a bigger school kind of gave them a lot of confidence; make them believe in themselves.
 "I'm lucky enough to have three strong captains that led by example in practice and in games," he said, referring to seniors Monroe Maki, Grace Hallinan and Sophia Musialkiewicz. "The other kids followed their lead. I never really had to question their effort."
 The starters were Maki and Hallinan at the forwards, senior Ashley Hillard and junior Nicole Lane in the backcourt and junior Lucciana Robertson at center.
 Occhi thanked junior varsity coach Mark Wilens and modified coach Lori Matteson for all their hard work and also wife Ginny and Athletic Director Kim Pilla for all their support.
 Next season will be a rebuilding year for the Eagles.
 "We will be bringing up five or six from JV, so we'll be pretty young with a bunch of sophomores," Occhi said. "We'll be young, but we won't be out-worked, that's for sure."

Rio Ferdinand has admitted he felt embarrassed after M a n c h e s t e r United lost the 2011 Champions League final to Barcelona. Goals from Pedro, Lionel Messi and David Villa saw Pep Guardiola’s side run out 3-1 winners at Wembley, with United striking through Wayne Rooney. Barca’s side that season is widely considered to be one of the best ever, with the midfield trio of Sergio Busquets, Xavi and Andres Iniesta arguably at their peak. Ferdinand and United had faced Barca in the final two years previous and lost – and the defender knew all about Messi after his stunning header in that game. “Messi was a killer,” Ferdinand told Copa90. “Ronaldinho was unreal, the free-flowing magician. “But with Messi, he’d do all of that but there was always a goal or an assist at the end of it.” Ferdinand revealed a conversation with United icons Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes following the 2011 showpiece, after Barca had dominated the game throughout to claim their second European title in three years. “Barca gave us an absolute lesson at Wembley,” Ferdinand added. “I was standing there watching them lift the trophy and me, Giggsy and Scholesy were standing together with our hands over our mouths and I said: ‘I feel embarrassed lads’. Ferguson, who won the Champions League in 1998- 99 and 2007-08, was left with no doubts as to which side was the superior. “They’re the best in Europe, no question about that,” he said at the time. “In my time as a manager, I would say they’re the best team we’ve faced. Everyone acknowledges that and I accept that.—AP

Jamie Carragher has urged Liverpool to add a number of "quality" signings to their team in order to be able to compete for the Premier League title in 2017-18.
 Jurgen Klopp's men impressed in the big games in 2016-17, but their relatively underwhelming results against the so-called smaller teams meant they eventually had to settle for fourth place in the table.
 Carragher, who made over 500 appearances for the club, feels Liverpool showed they can compete with the best, yet believes they need to add to their ranks if they are to take the next step.
 "The actual team, the XI, could go up against anyone, we saw that in the big games with some great results in those games," Carragher told the official Liverpool website.
 "But over the season, especially around Christmas and January, it was evident that the squad was not big enough or strong enough. That needs adding to.
 "But rather than just adding players to the squad, you want to add players to the team. If you add three or four players and they go straight into the first XI, three or four of those who were playing week in, week out last season go to the bench.
 "It makes the bench a lot stronger and your team a lot stronger. It is not just numbers. It is about getting the right quality that can go straight into the team."

Statewide directives asking for large public gatherings to cancel activities due to Covid-19 has had an enormous economic effect on many small businesses, including a rural Stafford County venue, The Welch Farm. Located west of Macksville, Kansas,
   
 Welch Farm is a wedding and event venue which is available to lease for weddings and family events. The farm also hosts concerts, air bnb guests, guided hunts and has both catering and liquor licenses.
   
 In 2019, Welch Farm hosted families from 35 states and 7 foreign countries including Mexico, China, France, Canada, South Africa, Australia, and The United Kingdom.
   
 The visionaries behind the rustic and re-purposed venue, Kevin and Michell Welch and their daughter, Megan Schnoebelen, have become well known in recent years for their hospitality, catering events both on and off the farm, their homemade BBQ sauce, which is
   
 Kevin's mother secret recipe and the overall fun and relaxing atmosphere that they have created from a once abandoned farmstead.
   
 "However, due to Covid-19, The Welch Farm has complied with state-wide social distancing requests and postponed all events both on and off the farm through the end of April," Michell Welch said. "The count is currently at 9 events that have been postponed."
   
 The Welch Farm was scheduled to kick off their seasonal venue events on March 28, 2020, by hosting the wedding of Larned couple, Kayla Reisner and Mathew Thompson.
   
 Mat and Kayla share a unique coincidence in that they both were born on March 28. The couple wanted to make March 28th their wedding day as well. Although, their large wedding and reception did not take place on March 28 due to Covid-19, the couple did come to the farm on their wedding day with their two children, the bride's parents, the matron of honor (brides sister), the groom's best man (brides brother in law) and the grooms sister. These family members were the only attendees for the couple's special day. Kevin Welch officiated the very short service and no other guests were present. The Thompson's reception has been rescheduled for Saturday, September 12, 2020, when hopefully, all their friends and family can safely attend their celebration.
   
 May 2020 events remain uncertain at this time and planned May 2nd bride, Jenna Bland of Pratt, has rescheduled for later in the summer."
   
 The Welch Farm also has had a June 5 "Welcome to Summer" concert scheduled for some time. In fact, they had just worked out the details when the shutdown happened. The Josh Abbott Band is the featured guest and hopefully things will have returned to normal by that time. However, The Welch Farm will follow all state guidelines concerning social distancing recommendations and are hoping if Covid19 is not under control by that date, that the band will work with them for an alternate date when it is safe for people to once again socialize in large crowds.
   
 Logan Mize was the first concert at The Welch Farm, and it was such a huge hit for this rural venue, that many requests have been made to the Welch's to continue this type of event.
   
 For the Welch family, 2019 was a busy year at the Farm. The first wedding of the season was April 20, Easter weekend, with the marriage of Taylor Tittle and Gabriel Bronkhorst. The Welch Farm was then reserved every weekend from Easter to October 26, 2019 with the exception of only a few open dates.
   
 The Welch Farm is currently a non-climate controlled, seasonal venue with a large pavilion, plenty of shade and lots of rustic charm.
   
 "We just started the dirt work to begin renovations of the back barn which will have a conference space to host corporate meetings, group hunter get togethers, a porch for VIP ticket holders to concert events and a spa similar to Rock Haven south of Hays," Michelle Welch said.
   
 The Welch Farm does have a few openings available for summer and a few in September and October of 2020, they do however, already have events scheduled for 2021.
   
 For weddings and events that were forced to cancel due to social distancing and numbers of people allowed to gather at one time, Welch offered brides and event coordinators any available open date to reschedule their special event. There is no rescheduling fee. No additional charges. No extra anything.
   
 "If your special day was canceled due to Covid-19, you have first choice at any future available date and we will also help anyone who has booked with other venues who are not as fortunate with options available for alternate dates," Welch said. "Public event cancellations are out of our hands and out of the hands of our guests. We do, however, have clients sign a contract when reserving a date at The Welch Farm, and we do require that they purchase event insurance. No one has ever had to use their insurance. We require this for several reasons including liability, but you never know about severe weather such as tornadoes and such and weddings are expensive."
   
 Welch said they definitely wanted to do everything possible as people and as a business to make this time of coronavirus pandemic less stressful on all parties.
   
 While 2020 may not be going as expected for The Welch Farm, they aren't ready to stop moving forward anytime soon.
   
 "We are available to resume outside catering starting May 1,"Welch said.
   
 Although The Welch Farm has both food and beverage licenses, they are not available to the public to stop in anytime. It is a private venue available to lease for special occasions. However, The Welch Farm is observing the recommendations set forth by the governor of Kansas and no events will be hosted through the April 30 guidelines. Dates beyond April 30 could be affected as well.

Stranded cruise ships have become a symbol of the COVID-19 pandemic. Passengers and crew are desperate to get off but the ports to which they've headed don't want them.
 It is no exaggeration to suggest this crisis could spell the end of the line for an industry already on the nose for its social, health and environmental problems.
 Indeed the same business model at the root of those problems is the cause of its current crisis, in which ship operators have been accused of gross or even criminal negligence.
 That model has to do with flags of convenience.
 Flags of convenience mean ships operate in waters far from their "home" ports. Most are registered in Caribbean tax havens. Operating outside clear jurisdictions, wages are low and working conditions often poor.

John Terry will not feel like he is at a smaller club if he moves from Chelsea to Aston Villa, according to Tim Sherwood.
 Former Chelsea captain Terry is a free agent having opted to leave the Premier League champions after 22 years at the club, a spell that saw him win 15 major trophies.
 Championship club Villa are favourites to sign the 36-year-old, with rivals Birmingham City also in the running.
 "I think both would be married up very well," former Villa boss Sherwood told Sky Sports of the prospect of a move for Terry.
 "Every club needs them characters, certainly a huge cub like Villa with the fan base that they have got.
 "Certainly John won't feel like he is going to a smaller club."
 Sherwood was full of praise for Terry's leadership skills and feels he would have a huge impact at Villa both on and off the pitch.
 "I think John's an excellent professional, not only what he will bring on the pitch but what he will bring to the dressing room," he continued.
 "He will make other players around him better. They need some leaders there and certainly there are no bigger leaders than John Terry."
 Terry fell out of favour at Chelsea after Antonio Conte's arrival as head coach, only making nine top-flight appearances in 2016-17.

By concentration, the CBD gummies market is bifurcated into high and low/ concentrated products. The demand for high CBD gummies is estimated to witness strong growth over the forecasted period. Patients of epilepsy, sleep disorders, schizophrenia, and glaucoma are the major consumers of high concentrated CBD gummies with more than 20mg CBD content per gummy. Growing awareness among consumers regarding the advantages of the marijuana edibles for the treatment of sleep disorders is anticipated to fuel the segment growth in near future.

It is about this time of the year when gardeners yearn to get gardening and when some people become interested in gardening for the first time. This year, as we are staying home due to the coronavirus, even more people are beginning to garden or garden more, particularly to grow food. Like most things, gardening is easy, if you know how - even in this neck of the woods.
   
 Whether you want to grow flowers, vegetables, or both, my advice is the same. Don't try to do too much and too many different things while you are first beginning to garden. Learning and slowly expanding the amount of gardening you do will help prevent frustration.
   
 The basics are the same for all gardening. Preparing the soil should be first and foremost when it comes to gardening. You can change your soil by amending it with a variety of materials. Your amendments will depend in part on what you want to grow. The easiest things to grow with the fewest required amendments are plants that are native or well adapted to our area. In fact, you may need no amendments if you grow the right plants.
   
 At the opposite end of the spectrum, if you want to grow vegetables, you will need more amendments than with most other types of gardens. Beans, tomatoes, lettuce, carrots and other veggies do best in rich, loamy soil that has lots of organic matter which is sorely lacking in our largely clay soil.
   
 When you amend your soil, understand that it will likely take several years to get it the way you want it. You can spend a lot of money buying amendments to change your soil, but the best thing you can do is add compost, which is free if you make your own.
   
 Having decided the type of gardening you want to do and the amendments you will need, select your plants to conform to these conditions. Keep your initial garden area small so that you do not become overwhelmed with work with which you are not yet familiar.
   
 Learn from observing the plants you select, and you will begin to expand your knowledge without even knowing it. As you gain experience, you will gain confidence and can begin to take on more and different things.
   
 Working outside in a garden of any type is great therapy. Nurturing plants and creating beauty and/or good food is very rewarding. It is also a good experience for children and will give them something different to do. If you are new to this, teaching someone while learning is one of the best ways to learn.
   
 As you begin this process, I recommend that you also begin a garden journal. It will not only help you remember what to do and what not to do, but if you really become hooked on gardening, you will be happy to have your early musings years from now when you look back.

Many conspiracy theorists make hay over the fact these kinds of conferences and exercises "conveniently happen" to take place near major disasters. Of course, we can't predict earthquakes, but many 9/11 truthers will cry foul over how emergency services were already on-hand in readiness for a bioterrorism drill that was scheduled for September 12, 2001. The loony fringe is already foaming at their keyboards over Covid-19, pointing at recent pandemic warnings by Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci as "proof that they knew" a novel coronavirus would emerge in Wuhan in 2019.


  Anyone in the industry will tell you this only demonstrates how frequently these drills and exercises are happening because they're so valuable. After all, the US is in the middle of a heated debate about whether - and how much - the Trump administration ignored the Obama-era "pandemic playbook", a document that says at the beginning that exercises are critical "to improve interoperability and real-time decision making".


  So how do you establish an exercise regime that covers off more than the how- to of standard operating procedures and equipment drills, but where the policy and political environment is unpredictable? And how do you do it for something as complex as a pandemic? For some countries, their "worst-case pandemic scenario" doesn't just involve the human health impacts, but also the survival of political structures and possible civil unrest, not to mention the world economy which is already in ICU.


  Preparedness isn't just about people knowing how to treat a patient or how to use the backup servers. Even before you get into pressure testing or "red teaming" ways to make an exercise more challenging, people need to get comfortable with the scope of their roles. This involves having ownership of their main tasks, and knowing how their responsibilities interact with those in their own organisation and other agencies across the full span of command and control. This is the value of emergency management exercises and conferences. To discuss and test plans on a moving carpet, and always with an understanding that things will change once you eventually get punched in the mouth.


  Emergency scenarios are critical for this because exercises are a safe space where people can learn and make mistakes at the outer fringes of their capabilities, not just demonstrate what they already know. The last thing you want is someone to be defensive about participating and arguing that "it wouldn't really happen this way in real life".


  One option is to use a historical scenario as an initial template. At the very least, it means the overall timeline - as well as the technical and scientific details - can't be disputed, even if the decisions and the social and political context may differ. But while a historical scenario can be useful, it can be a hard sell for practical-minded participants who may already be uncomfortable with the "play-acting" element of exercises.

Eddie Hickman wants to join the Maury County Board of Education, the same group that ousted him in February 2015 after a 42-year career in education.
   
 Hickman was director of schools when the board bought out his contract, opening to door to hire Superintendent Chris Marczak. The board decided earlier this year not to extend Marczak's contract and is searching for a replacement.
   
 "A lot of people have asked me, 'Why are you running for the school board?' You should apply for your old job,' " said the 69-year-old Hickman, who qualified for the August ballot last week.
   
 The board has extended the superintendent application deadline until April 30 because of the coronavirus outbreak.
   
 "I'm not interested in going back to work full time, but I have a lot to offer for the school board," Hickman said. "I do have more than 40 years of experience from teacher to coach, from principal to director of schools.
   
 "Education is my life. I've been at it a long time," Hickman added. "I went to school in Maury County, and this is my home. I love Maury County Public Schools. I feel deep down that it's a obligation I should do in bringing stability to the school system and school board."
   
 Hickman and his wife, Shelia, have more than 75 years of experience in education. Hickman started his career at Hampshire in 1973. Sheila, 73, was at Central High School from 1969 until 1997, when she left as a teacher for Cox Middle School when Eddie was appointed as principal.
   
 "She might not be my campaign manager, but she is going to give me behind-the- scenes advice," Hickman chuckled.
   
 Hickman coached Betty Booker, perhaps Maury County's most famous and decorated female athlete, at Hampshire. The team was district and state contenders from 1973-1976 with Booker in the lineup. Girls played three-on-three basketball in the 1970s.
   
 "All I had to do was guide her," Hickman said. "She was an amazing, outstanding player. We were quite successful."
   
 Booker moved on to the University of Memphis -- then called Memphis State University -- and Hickman went from Hampshire to Mt. Pleasant. He was told Hampshire School was going to close, but a last-minute decision by former superintendent Ed Cox kept it open.
   
 "He told me if I wanted a job, I better go over to Mt. Pleasant," Hickman said.
   
 Hickman spent more than a decade at Central. He was a physical education coach and teacher from 1988 until he was named interim principal and principal in 1997. He earned his master's degree in administration and supervision from Trevecca Nazarene in 1992.
   
 "That was one of the greatest sacrifices I ever made for Eddie Hickman," Shelia said. "He was in line to be principal, so I had to give up my job teaching at Central. That was one of the hardest decisions we ever had to make.
   
 "That was my school, too," she continued. "I promised them, if they hired me, I would never leave. They were a lot of differences teaching honors high school and middle school."
   
 Shelia said the decision actually involved a lot of tears for her, even as they celebrated Eddie's advancement.
   
 "We make a very good team," Shelia said. "We resolved it after a lot of tears."
   
 Eddie said: "She felt strongly that it was in the best interests of Central because the staff wanted me as principal. But it was a difficult time. We worked through it and did very well."
   
 Hickman was chosen as director of schools in 2004 and served until an unceremonious departure in 2015. The school board bought out the remainder of his contract over issues that included lower-than-expected standardized test scores.
   
 "My trouble was our test scores," Hickman said. "The majority of my time was successful, and I enjoyed it, but there was things I would change, looking back. I was never going to satisfy my last school board. I told my staff that when the focus started to be about me, that it would be time for me to go home.
   
 "I could have fought them [more]," he said. "I asked them to buy me out when they were trying to run me out. I tried to make it positive as I could. One would be bitter for a while, but I've had former commissioners and school board members who've come to me since and asked me for forgiveness in letting me go."
   
 Hickman, who wound up with a $152,000 severance, pushed the school board and Maury County Commission to build a new Central High School. He was rebuffed and told it would never be done as long as he was director of schools. Shortly after he left and before Marczak arrived, the county commission approved funding.
   
 "It was frustrating we could not get the money," Hickman said. "Several previous Central principals wanted to build a new high school. I was just in a position as director of schools to plan and possibly get it done.
   
 "That was the most disappointing thing about my career -- that I could not convince them to build the new school before they bought out my contract," he added.
   
 When the new Central debuted in July 2016, Hickman was invited to the grand- opening ceremony. He posed for ribbon-cutting photos with Marczak, principal Roger White and local politicians. Other than that, Hickman said he did not have much interaction with Marczak, who started in August 2015.
   
 "He always said he wanted to make an appointment to talk, but he never did," Hickman said. "I have empathy for him as he's finishing his contract."
   
 The new superintendent will have to spend more time in the office, be upfront with stakeholders and follow the rules and regulations more closely, said Hickman, who will not be part of choosing a new superintendent if elected. The new school board will start in September.
   
 Some have expressed the opinion that Hickman would be a distraction if he were on the school board. Though not unprecedented in Tennessee, no former superintendent or director of schools has served on the Maury County school board.
   
 "I realize it might bother some other members if I'm up there as a former director of schools," Hickman said. "The biggest advantage to having me is that I have been there. I have worked with lots of school board members. That should outweigh any worries … about me being on the school board. I am not running to run the school system."
   
 Hickman will have an opponent in seeking the District 6 school board seek being vacated by Nathan Adkison, who was elected in 2016. School teacher Marlina Ervin is also on the ballot.
   
 Hickman said some friends have told him he's "crazy" for running. "But I don't think I am," he added, laughing. "I feel I can be a good school board member."
   
 Sheila said Eddie's not crazy for running and will support his efforts.
   
 "I have always supported him whether I agreed with him or not," Sheila said. "I do agree he would be a good school board member. We love the schools and want to see them in good hands."

LAFAYETTE, La. (AP) " Louisiana students and teachers learned suddenly before dismissal on a Friday afternoon that schools would shut down for a month.
 It was jarring news, and on top of all the questions " Would there be distance learning? What about meals? What happens with testing? " many educators were just plain sad.
 'Oh my word, this is even harder than summer break,' said Jennifer Babineaux, a first-grade teacher at Broadmoor Elementary in Lafayette.
 She described the initial feeling as something similar to mourning or grieving. She's not alone. Blogs using the same descriptors have circulated on social media as teachers related and shared.
 'The announcement was made during our last hour, which is my planning (hour), so I never got a chance to tell any of my babies goodbye,' said Lucie Mesuch, who is in her 29th year teaching middle school in Sulphur.
 Taylor Wallace, a fourth-grade teacher at Woodvale Elementary in Lafayette, was out of town the last day of school, and her substitute called her at the end of the day to let the kids say goodbye on speakerphone.
 'It made me so emotional to think that I wouldn't see them for a while and even more that I couldn't be there to help them through this huge transition,' Wallace said.
 And now Louisiana schools will be closed at least through April 30, as Gov. John Bel Edwards extended his stay-at-home order last week to align with guidelines from the president and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
 Teachers miss their students. They worry about them " that they'll lose what they've learned this year, that they'll fall behind, that they won't be fed enough or loved enough. Teachers develop relationships with students from all backgrounds and home lives, and they worry what will happen while schools are closed.
 'I worry about my students who come to school to be loved, who need the support they find there,' Mesuch said. 'I have one student who had not been himself the past few days. I wanted to talk to him Friday, but he told me he was OK and would talk to me Monday, so I have been worried about him.'
 She's thankful and proud that her district, like others across the state, has been providing food for those who need it.
 Soon after Edwards' proclamation closing schools, teachers were able to return to campuses briefly to collect items and finish grading for the third nine weeks. Being back on campus without their students stirred emotions.
 Carletta Anthony Jones teaches fourth grade reading and social studies at a school in northwest Louisiana.
 'I just arrived at my school, Natchitoches Magnet, and the tears are just falling!' Jones said. 'As the young ones would say, 'I'm feeling some type of way.' I really miss my students! My prayer is that my students, coworkers and all stay safe.'
 When art teacher Erin Parish went to clean her room at Natchitoches Magnet, she wanted to make sure the classroom would be ready for kids when " or if " they return this year.
 'To cope, I sat outside looking for four leaf clovers, taking photos, and trying to create crowns, praying the entire time as I do it,' she said, 'trying not to let my mind wander and become panicked.'
 Her husband told her if they do come back with just a week left, at least she would get to say goodbye to her eighth-graders and watch them graduate on to high school.
 'That broke me a little and got me crying because I really, really miss my kids,' Parish said. 'I didn't say bye on Friday because I was extremely ill. I didn't get to tell them that I'll miss them. I didn't get to tell them that I hope they still create and can't wait to see what they have made when we come back. I just pray they're all OK and healthy.'
 In nearly every comment, teachers have expressed how much they miss their students, whom they've spent so much time with. That makes school like a home, Lafayette student teacher Raegan Abshire said.
 'It's like a second family,' Abshire said.
 And email and video conferencing don't quite fill the void, teachers are finding.
 'I miss working with my students, man,' said Mark Burt, visual art instructor in the Bossier Talented Arts Program. 'I really miss seeing an engaged student " the expressions they have on their face when they solve a problem with my tutelage and encouragement.'
 Andrea Buchanan McFarlain, a teacher at Sulphur High School, feels the same way and is surprised when people expect her to be happy about being out of school.
 'Everyone assumes we are so excited to be 'off' work, but I'm miserable!' McFarlain said. 'I miss my students!'
 Like many teachers, she's worried about how being out of school this long will impact student learning.
 McFarlain teaches junior and senior Advanced Placement English and an EdRising course for future teachers.
 'All classes involve testing for college credits, and I want my babies to get those credits,' McFarlain said.
 She's been messaging her students online assignments to help them prepare for upcoming AP exams, which will be given online and in a shorter format.
 'My classes work best face-to-face,' but she's figuring out the web conferencing software Zoom, she said.
 McFarlain 'hopes and prays we are able to go back,' echoing a sentiment so many others are voicing. They hope to return to school this semester, fit in some instruction and say a proper goodbye, especially to seniors.
 'I hope people take these health directives seriously, and I hope, if it's safe, we will get to go back to school for a few weeks and at least let our seniors graduate,' said Christa Cunningham, creative writing and AP English teacher at the Magnet Academy for Cultural Arts in Opelousas.
 'While I know this is for the best, I feel bad for kids missing out on experiences they were counting on,' she continued. 'I feel sad for the older kids who are missing milestones such as prom, ring ceremony and graduation, rites of passage that everyone gets.'
 It's that social aspect of school that worries Cathlean Gilmer Snyder, a math teacher at Southwood High School in Shreveport. The transition for her students to online learning hasn't been challenging 'as far as the coursework is concerned,' she said.
 But her high-schoolers are concerned with what life is going to look like and when life is going to get back to normal, she said.
 'I just try to make sure, very much, to take care of them in that way, too, just as much as I've made sure they've finished their math curriculum,' Snyder said. 'That's important, that math is important. But making sure they get through this time of chaos OK and stable and emotionally all there, that's what's most important to me.'
 Wallace plans to see her kids again one way or another.
 'If we don't end up going back to school this year, I do fully plan to host a get together for our classes when it is safe to be able to celebrate their hard work and success this year as a whole,' she said. 'We will get a chance to say our proper goodbyes, somehow, someway!'

Early Monday morning in Asia, Reuters came out with the downbeat comments from the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari. The Fed policymaker crossed wires while appearing on CBS's "Face the Nation". Key quotes This could be a long, hard road that we have ahead of us until we get to either an effective therapy or a vaccine. It's hard for me to see a V-shaped recovery under that scenario. We could have these waves of flare-ups, controls, flare-ups and controls until we actually get a therapy or a vaccine. Public health experts have warned that the U.S. death toll could surge to 200,000 over the summer, from 21,300 on Sunday, if unprecedented stay-at-home orders that have closed businesses and kept most Americans indoors are lifted when they expire at the end of the month. Kashkari said additional support was needed for small businesses beyond the $350 billion provided in the coronavirus aid package passed in March, but he was optimistic that Congress would approve more funding. He added that he was looking toward an 18-month strategy to address the health and economic effects of the pandemic. During that time, certain parts of the economy may close and re-open on a rolling basis, starting with workers who are at lowest risk of infection.

You've stocked your pantry, arranged your daily routines to minimize risky interpersonal contact, and considered how you would use your living space if someone in your family got sick. You always have one eye on the news. I'll bet when the usefulness of wearing non-medical-grade face coverings became the official guidance, you were searching the Web for masks or the sewing patterns to make them.

This is really two questions, "How can I minimize my chance of getting sick?" and, "How can I maximize the enjoyment of each passing day as we all live through this?" That second question is important because life did not stop the day your kids' schools closed, you were sent home from work, or you noticed the mall was deserted. Life is every passing moment, including this one. It is only lived in the present tense. We are not just waiting in the theater lobby for a stage performance of "Life Returns after The Virus," for the date of that opening night has not yet been announced and the script has not yet been written.
   
 Fortunately, there is something you can do right now that you may find helpful in addressing both of these questions. Let's start with keeping well. Whenever there is a bug going around in a typical winter, some people get sick and others don't. Lots of factors undoubtedly go into why that is true, but one of them is the immune system. We worry every year about flu and pneumonia in the elderly because we know their immune systems weaken with age. We are also concerned for those who must take medications known to damage their immune systems.
   
 As we respond to the unprecedented sense of vulnerability inherent in this time, our stress levels are clearly unhealthy. A mountain of scholarly literature says stress can contribute to an impaired immune response. So anything we can do to lower stress is going to help our wellness. When stress is under control, we see things more clearly, are slower to anger, less prone to despair, less likely to lean on our addictions (be they cellphones or something more serious), and certain to make better decisions on a moment-to- moment basis. This can't help but reduce tension, leading to greater harmony in our closely quartered families. If managing stress can make things even a little better, it seems we might decide to invest 20 minutes a day in doing so. If you have that much time, I've got a method and a personal offer for you.
   
 Meditation has helped people get through any number of calamities in the past, and it can help pull us through this one. All it takes is a little instruction, a group of people to do it with, and a commitment to invest the time, even when one is not in the mood. Meditation has been used to reduce and manage stress for thousands of years by millions of people all over the world. In the last decade or so, its efficacy has been repeatedly established by rigorous clinical research, often conducted by very skeptical neuroscientists. I have worked with meditation for over 20 years and have served as Lead Teacher for the High Plains Meditation Circle, based in Canyon, for six recent years. I am not certified in any particular tradition but make use of what I feel are the best elements of several methods.
   
 You need a teacher who gets to know you and care about you to succeed in this practice. I know nobody who successfully established a long-term meditation habit solely by reading a book or listening to audiotapes. You will also need a class or group for support. I've seen many people try to meditate regularly entirely on their own, but they typically don't last more than a short time.
   
 Which leads to an invitation for you. To meet the needs of this moment, I have recently begun a new online meditation class for total beginners. The only requirement is that you must be 18 or older. This class is free and donations are not accepted. Our one-hour session is Thursday at 6:30 p.m.. We are using the ZOOM video-conference software in a protected mode for additional security. ZOOM is also free for meeting participants.
   
 Let's dispose of one bit of nonsense that might get in the way for a few. While the meditation our group practices came out of the East, it is wildly untrue to label it as un-Christian or anti-Christian. There are Christian meditators and meditation teachers all over the world doing a practice nearly identical to what we use in our group. Meditation is not prayer, but practitioners often do both.
   
 I have a few spaces available in the current class, and am looking forward to the possibility of opening up as many additional sections as become necessary to meet the demand. If you think this free class might be of value to you, please email me at rosemedclass@gmail.com. Be sure to include a phone number. Then we can visit about how it all works.
   
 May you be happy, at peace, and free from suffering.

China’s economy seems to be getting restarted, at least to a limited extent and despite the restrained monetary and fiscal policy responses to date. Key economic indicators such as industrial output, retail sales, and fixed asset investment contracted sharply in the first two months of the year, but there are signs that the contraction might have bottomed out. In some respects, China’s command economy is built to better withstand such massive shocks compared to market economies. Its government can aggressively marshal national resources beyond the limits of traditional macroeconomic tools, by directly supporting enterprises and banks. But the economy is hardly out of the woods yet, especially with unemployment rising, domestic and external demand likely to remain weak, and given the risks of a second wave of infection.

 It is about this time of the year when gardeners yearn to get gardening and when some people become interested in gardening for the first time. This year, as we are staying home due to the coronavirus, even more people are beginning to garden or garden more, particularly to grow food. Like most things, gardening is easy, if you know how - even in this neck of the woods.
 Whether you want to grow flowers, vegetables, or both, my advice is the same. Don't try to do too much and too many different things while you are first beginning to garden. Learning and slowly expanding the amount of gardening you do will help prevent frustration.
 The basics are the same for all gardening. Preparing the soil should be first and foremost when it comes to gardening. You can change your soil by amending it with a variety of materials. Your amendments will depend in part on what you want to grow. The easiest things to grow with the fewest required amendments are plants that are native or well adapted to our area. In fact, you may need no amendments if you grow the right plants.
 At the opposite end of the spectrum, if you want to grow vegetables, you will need more amendments than with most other types of gardens. Beans, tomatoes, lettuce, carrots and other veggies do best in rich, loamy soil that has lots of organic matter which is sorely lacking in our largely clay soil.
 When you amend your soil, understand that it will likely take several years to get it the way you want it. You can spend a lot of money buying amendments to change your soil, but the best thing you can do is add compost, which is free if you make your own.
 Having decided the type of gardening you want to do and the amendments you will need, select your plants to conform to these conditions. Keep your initial garden area small so that you do not become overwhelmed with work with which you are not yet familiar.
 Learn from observing the plants you select, and you will begin to expand your knowledge without even knowing it. As you gain experience, you will gain confidence and can begin to take on more and different things.
 Working outside in a garden of any type is great therapy. Nurturing plants and creating beauty and/or good food is very rewarding. It is also a good experience for children and will give them something different to do. If you are new to this, teaching someone while learning is one of the best ways to learn.
 As you begin this process, I recommend that you also begin a garden journal. It will not only help you remember what to do and what not to do, but if you really become hooked on gardening, you will be happy to have your early musings years from now when you look back.

As we reported last March, the man suffered back injuries when he mistakenly launched from a French Air Force Rafale after takeoff from Saint-Dizier 113 air base in eastern France on March 20, 2019. Early reports said he was a journalist on a familiarization flight but he was actually the reluctant recipient of a farewell flight when he retired from a French defence contractor. According to a translation of the air force’s report on the mishap, the terrified pensioner was not only personally unprepared for the flight, he was not properly strapped in or dressed and that contributed to the incident.

 Editor:
 These are troubling times for sure, as difficult as I can recall dating back to major wars. Authorities in office have a tremendous burden with which to deal. Something happened over the weekend, however, which I believe could be sorted out better by your columnist Judge Napolitano than I about the legality of the matter.
 Father S.T. Stutton , the pastor of our church, St. Joseph, prepared packages of palm which people in the parish could drive to the former school parking lot to obtain for Palm Sunday. This made me happy since my parents began taking me to St. Carthage Church in Philadelphia since 1930 and my Sicilian wife has been making beautiful palm crosses all her life.
 A fellow church goer and friend told me, however, he drove to pick up a bundle only to find that the Newton Police Department told the pastor he could not provide palm for the members of the congregation in sterilized small packages.
 I can support our bishop's decision to close the churches until this coronavirus scourge is over, but stopping the passing out of a sacramental under the conditions prepared by the pastor seems like overkill.
 My own opinion of police departments, state and local has been high with family members serving in both World Wars and later becoming police officers.
 I served in the U.S. Navy aboard an ammunition ship and sleeping every night with 20,000 tons of ammunition on board was good preparation for later life as a school superintendent.
 So my experience with police and service personnel was somewhat extensive and very positive. That does not mean someone can't make an error in judgment.
 I would appreciate the opinion of Judge Napolitano on the case of the Palm Sunday endeavor at St. Joseph's Church. His writing is as good as it gets because he certainly understands constitutional law.

Airborne ranger, airborne ranger, where have you been?
   
 Around the world and back again.
   
 Airborne ranger, airborne ranger, how did you get there?
   
 In a c-130 flying low.
   
 This is the only cadence I can remember from airborne school that is appropriate for G-rated audiences. Airborne training is a three-week course the Army uses to prepare soldiers to jump out of perfectly good airplanes.
   
 The main intent is to get soldiers into areas quickly that don't have easy access from the ground. The first day I didn't know what to expect and thought it would be like the first day of basic training. I was wrong on so many counts because they already assumed you were a well-oiled fighting machine.
   
 Which by that time is mostly the case. Once you arrive at the school you are assigned to a training unit. These are the people you will spend the next three weeks with whether you like it or not. Week one is mostly about the basics, learning to strap into the parachute and checking to ensure everyone is strapped in correctly. You also run everywhere.
   
 This is a slow run, almost like you are jogging in place at a fast walking cadence affectionately referred to as the airborne shuffle. This is so you build up your calf muscles and thighs. This works. By the end of the three weeks I bet I put on 15 pounds of muscle. We also had to do 10 pullups every time you walk in or out of any building.
   
 This doesn't sound like much but by the end of the day you have done a few hundred pullups. This is to strengthen the muscles you will need to try and slow yourself down before hitting the ground. During this time any type of muscle soother becomes your best friend and a welcome relief to this day.
   
 During ground week they have all kinds of simulators where they hook you up in a pretend parachute harness and have you jump out of mock doors, I bet 100,000 times. This is the swing landing trainer. It is the most uncomfortable device imaginable for a man. The straps go in-between your legs and you dangle there for what seems like hours every day.
   
 I thought this was so repetitive, but once you get into the door of the plane in week three, your muscle memory takes over and you go out the door without even thinking about your altitude. Week two is tower week. The Army purchased a ride from the 1939 world's fair. I didn't know how it worked then and I am not sure what the legal repercussions might have been, but they strap you into parachutes and take you up about 200 feet and release you.
   
 Finally comes week three, jump week. This is the pinnacle of hurry up and wait. You go to the airfield at 0'dark thirty, get in you parachutes and wait and wait, and when you think you might get to finally go, you wait more. They finally load you up in a c-130 and take off to 1,250 feet. There are massive dirt fields you jump into to try and cushion the fall for your first time. You are arranged in units called sticks while in the plane.
   
 When it is your turn, you stand up and shuffle out the door. When it is your turn standing in the door, I can say the fear is so bad you can almost smell it. I think it is exacerbated by the many hours of waiting it takes to get to this point. Muscle memory takes over and you are out the door before you even know it.
   
 The fall seems slow while you are going down peaceful and beautiful. I can see why people do this for fun. However about 30 feet from the ground you realize how fast you are going. You hardly have time to prepare and get your feet together for the parachute landing fall. This is basically gracefully hitting the dirt and rolling to try and absorb some of the impact. Feet, roll side then shoulders. There is no way to gracefully land going at these speeds and so every jump many soldiers get injured especially if you hit a tree or anything without give. I was no exception to this rule and eventually destroyed my ankle and had to have several screws other things put in there to reattach the bones to the right places. I still got my wings because even if you are injured if you gather your chute and make it to the assemble point, the jump counts.

LAS VEGAS (AP) — The number of confirmed coronavirus infections across Nevada climbed to 2,836 on Sunday as related deaths increased to 112. State health officials tallied the new infections Sunday on a website dedicated to the virus outbreak. Nearly 25,000 tests for COVID-19 have been performed statewide. Leaders of a popular vacation spot on the Nevada side of Lake Tahoe on Sunday urged second-home owners to stay away. Incline Village leaders in a statement Sunday warned that health care resources for the mountain-lake community would be easily overwhelmed by a coronavirus outbreak. They highlighted a spate of COVID-19 infections in Truckee, California. Among the new deaths from COVID-19 in Nevada was a man in his 90s from Washoe County that extends across Reno. University Medical Center in Las Vegas has begun prescribing hydroxychloroquine to nonhospitalized coronavirus patients with fever and mild pneumonia. “Certainly if you are working here or in New York, you want to be able to help the patients, and right now this is the best we have,” hospital emergency medical physician Thomas Zyniewicz told the Las Vegas Review-Journal in a videotaped interview. President Donald Trump has been talking up hydroxychloroquine, a drug long used to treat malaria, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, after very small preliminary studies suggested it might help prevent coronavirus from entering cells and possibly help patients clear the virus sooner. The drug has major potential side effects, and the Food and Drug Administration says people should not take it without a prescription. Research studies are beginning to test if the drug truly helps COVID-19 patients, and the FDA has allowed the drugs into the national stockpile as an option for doctors to consider for patients who...

Chile substitute Martin Rodriguez scored his first international goal to salvage a 1-1 Confederations Cup draw with Australia that seals a mouth- watering semi-final tie against Portugal.
 James Troisi scored his first Australia goal for over two years to give the Socceroos – who needed a two-goal victory to move above their opponents in Group B – a surprise half-time lead.
 But Rodriguez, who was introduced at half time, levelled to calm Chile's nerves about elimination and ensure they finish second to pool winners Germany, who beat Cameroon 3-1 in Sunday's other game.
 Chile came into the match in Moscow sitting top of the group, a position that would have seen them face Mexico, but instead they will meet Cristiano Ronaldo and the European champions in the last four.
 Australia, meanwhile, are out and finish third in the group as their winless Confederations Cup run extends to six matches despite a creditable performance against the world's fourth-ranked side.
 Chile made a fast start, Arturo Vidal meeting Jose Fuenzalida's cross and forcing Mathew Ryan to parry away his volley from the edge of the area, with Eduardo Vargas unable to convert the rebound.
 Mark Milligan made a superb challenge on Alexis Sanchez as the Chile forward bore down on goal, VAR finding no issue, while Tim Cahill - who became the second Australia player to reach 100 caps - was booked for a rash foul on Charles Aranguiz, a decision backed up by another review.
 Australia threatened for the first time when Massimo Luongo forced a good close-range save from Claudio Bravo after Troisi's throughball and the Socceroos then took a surprise lead after 42 minutes.
 Chile lost possession after Bravo had tried to play the ball out from defence and Robbie Kruse overcame a challenge from Gonzalo Jara to divert the ball into the path of Troisi to dink a cool finish over the keeper from six yards.
 After Vidal's header was deflected to safety at the other end, it should have been two for Australia before half-time, only for Trent Sainsbury to blaze over a volley from six yards after Cahill had presented him with the opportunity.
 Chile made a double half-time change, Pablo Hernandez and Rodriguez coming on and they made a decent start to the second half, Ryan reacted quickly to push away a powerful Vargas effort.
 Brighton keeper Ryan kept out Sanchez, before Chile drew level in scrappy fashion with 23 minutes remaining.
 Eugenio Mena's cross was only half cleared by Sainsbury, allowing Vargas' header to keep the ball alive and Rodriguez to force his effort past Ryan from six yards.
 Chile squandered a great chance to complete the turnaround when Sanchez beat Milligan down the left and cut back for Vargas, whose header drifted just wide.
 Australia substitute Jamie Maclaren missed a clear opportunity at the other end when he could not make proper contact with Troisi's throughball, knocking his effort wide with only Bravo to beat.
 But that was to prove Australia's last opportunity, as they still wait for their first victory over Chile, whose attention now turns to Wednesday's date with Portugal in Kazan.

Although in literally a similar trench in terms of high speed ovals early in his IndyCar tenure, the Aussie has been one of the best on the left-hander only result earners over the past three seasons.

Arch- rival Scott Dixon made solid progress in his maiden IRacing voyage in Alabama last week and could be a step ahead of most, considering he is one of the few drivers to actually race an IndyCar at MIS in real-life. Two other hard chargers who also fit into this elite club are A.J. Foyt Racing's Tony Kanaan and owner-driver Ed Carpenter.

A more focused attitude toward the IRacing Challenge compared to some could allow the three-time Indy 500 pole winner to enjoy a breakout effort after 275 miles.

  _Guest columns share an author's personal perspective._
 Quite understandably, much of the current discourse surrounding the COVID-19 crisis pertains to the physical health implications of the virus. Yet amid the rise of quarantine restrictions and social distancing practices, severe gaps in mental health care and support systems also represent a substantial concern.
 Just the mere thought of coronavirus can be anxiety-provoking for a person without an existing mental health diagnosis. For people with mental illness, the stress and fear associated with a rapidly spreading pandemic is exponentially more precarious, and can exacerbate an existing mental health or substance use problem.
 Long before the coronavirus outbreak, governments and other institutions were largely failing to protect at-risk individuals from a mental health perspective. Police officers and firefighters -- whose PTSD and depression rates are as much as five times higher than the rates within the civilian population -- are more likely to die by suicide than in the line of duty.
 The medical staffs working around the clock to treat patients with COVID-19, as well as a 'regular' patient base, are also being put under greater stress and anxiety while performing their duties as they try to balance treatment and not catching the virus or passing it on.
 At the same time, mental health disabilities are increasingly pervasive on college campuses. The American College Health Association found in 2018 that 40% of undergraduates had felt so depressed within the previous 12 months that it was difficult for them to function, while more than 10% of undergraduates had seriously considered suicide during the same period.
 Additionally, four of the eight Ivy League schools prohibit students from visiting campus while they are on leave. This means that students who are taking time away from the academic demands in order to focus on their own well-being become socially isolated, as they are banned from coming to campus to share a meal with friends.
 Now, as schools shut down for the remainder of the semester and social distancing measures are implemented nationwide in order to curb the spread of coronavirus, even the imperfect safe haven of a college campus community is no longer available to students with mental health conditions. International students, many of whom cannot return home due to travel restrictions, are even more isolated at this time. With this country's health care system bracing for the strain of a novel pandemic, who will step in to care for these vulnerable individuals?
 Philanthropy must answer the call by catalyzing the discussion, increasing resources, and destigmatizing the mental health conversation. Along these lines, the Newton and Boston-based Ruderman Family Foundation has a proven infrastructure already in place.
 The foundation partnered with This Is My Brave, an organization that has speakers tell their stories of dealing with their mental health in a storytelling format, to present \"This Is My Brave College Edition.\" The performances featured nine college students from Boston campuses who performed their stories at Lesley University, Harvard University, Northeastern University and Tufts University this past fall, and performed this spring at Boston University, Brandeis University and at the Ivy League Medical Conference at Harvard Medical School.
 We also partner with BRYT: Bridge for Resilient Youth in Transition, a program providing assistance for students to come back to school after an absence for treatment of a mental health diagnosis. Students re-entering school can feel overwhelmed, and this program helps to alleviate some of that apprehension. Each BRYT program approaches staffing, space, and services with a consistent vision, while customizing the specifics for each school population and for each student. This rapidly expanding program will undoubtedly be in greater demand when students are allowed to assimilate back on campus.
 Raising awareness and making a statement on a more national scale, we honored decorated swimmer Michael Phelps with the 2018 Morton E. Ruderman Award in Inclusion for his open discussion of his struggle with depression and anxiety.
 Currently, our organization is in the process of assessing how to specifically mobilize our resources on mental health care and support in response to COVID-19. In a world increasingly defined by isolation, we will not leave this vulnerable population behind.

Massimiliano Allegri has confirmed Juventus are interested in signing Bayern Munich forward Douglas Costa.
 The Brazil international is unhappy at Bayern after failing to secure a regular starting berth and recently admitted he was considering his options.
 Bayern are believed to be willing to let go of the 26-year-old if an offer in the region of €45 million comes in and Allegri has revealed Juventus are keen to lure him to Turin.
 "Douglas Costa is one of our objectives, he is a very good player," Allegri told Sky Sport Italia, before providing updates on the proposed transfers of forward Patrik Schick and goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny from Sampdoria and Arsenal respectively.
 "Schick has not arrived yet, but he does things that are out of the ordinary.
 "Szczesny is not done.
 "I know that when I get back for pre-season, the club will have signed players who improve the squad, but that is not easy because we have reached such a high level now that there are only a few players around who fit the bill. To move on, you need to find players who complete the areas where we are most lacking.
 "Numerically, the squad is done, apart from up front. We will just need to replace those who leave, but the club are very good at this."

After seeing their school year abruptly end with no warning just before spring break, schools in Bryan County, along with others across Oklahoma, returned to learning last week - or at least the closest thing to it possible right now.
   
 With a health emergency declared for all 77 counties by Governor Kevin Stitt, the Department of Education instituted distance learning statewide that began April 6 and will continue through the final day of the 2019-2020 school year on May 8.
   
 The U.S. Department of Education approved waivers requested by State Superintendent of Public Instruction Joy Hoffmeister allowing schools to move existing funds to help schools pay for COVID-19 matters and distance learning including technology.
   
 Distance learning was left up to each independent school district. Durant Public Schools Superintendent Duane Meredith had a large team of personnel working on the remote aspect after schools were shut down.
   
 "We probably had over 100 people that were part of the process of this in various aspects and we feel good about the plan they came up with," Meredith stated.
   
 "Every district has a plan, and some different plans, but I feel this is what best meets the needs of our students. It will allow them to refresh and maintain what they have learned this year as well as the enrichment component if they so choose to do that at every grade level. I feel like it was just a tremendous job by our team."
   
 Durant's remote learning plan includes a dashboard on the school's website, durantisd.org, with many assignments and enrichment activities.
   
 On the site there are links for each grade level with assignments that students can print and work on, or some that can be done online.
   
 For those that may not have internet access, lesson packets were made available for pick up by parents or students at school sites or at meal drop- off locations.
   
 New packets will be available each Monday and the website dashboard will also be updated at the beginning of each week for parents or students to check for information.
   
 "This situation was out of the kids' control and out of our control. so it's time to show some grace," Meredith added. "We still want to maintain education level with these kids but show them grace in the process.
   
 "If they are missing something that will help their grade, we are going to have to get creative. Teachers will be reaching out to their students throughout this process and working with them on different ways to do that. Student grades will not drop after face-to-face instruction ended. They can only increase and not decrease during this time."
   
 According to the Durant superintendent, the district was serving an average of 2,000 meals per day during the early portion of the process, which included breakfast and lunch for roughly 1,000 DISD students.
   
 This week that process was transitioned to three meals served in bulk on Mondays and Wednesdays only, which will continue for the remainder of the school year through May 8.
   
 Many senior students have been curious about the possibility of still having a graduation ceremony.
   
 Meredith remains hopeful about being able to have a ceremony for those seniors at some point, even if that is sometime in the summer.
   
 "It's our hope and desire to have an in-person graduation ceremony, but that is all on hold for the time being," stated Meredith. "We will make those decisions from CDC (Centers for Disease Control) recommendations and the health authorities.
   
 "Bless our seniors and my heart go out to them because they have lost so many things here at the end of their final year, but it's my hope we still give that to them, but it's still too early to make that call. We just want to delay that decision as long as possible."

Ever had a meal where the vegetables were so overcooked and tasteless that you wondered if there was any nutritional value left in them?
 Vegies are a good source of fibre, vitamins, minerals, and a group of substances called phytonutrients or phytochemicals.
 Getting the most out of our vegetables is critical to support our immune system during the coronavirus pandemic.
 While cooking makes many vegies easier to digest, cooking them for too long at high temperatures, or with too much water turns them into a tasteless mush and leaches away nutrients.
 This is especially so for vegies that contain water-soluble vitamins (vitamin C, B1, B2, B3 and folate).
 Minerals such as calcium, potassium, iron, zinc, which are not very water soluble, can also be leached out when the plant structure breaks down with extended cooking times.

Toby Alderweireld says reports that he will leave Tottenham during the close season are mere speculation and expects to still be with the Premier League runners-up next term.
 The Belgium international has been linked with Manchester City and Inter after excelling under the guidance of Mauricio Pochettino since arriving at the club in 2015.
 Alderweireld is reportedly at loggerheads with Tottenham's hierarchy over an extension to his current deal - which expires in 2020 - but he insists no talks have taken place and he has no intention of leaving Spurs.
 "I'm still waiting for a contract proposal, but in my mind I'm playing for Spurs next season," the 28-year-old is quoted as saying by Sky Sports News.
 "There is no talk now, so it's all rumours, because if there's no talk there's no rejection as well. We will see in the future how it will go."
 One man who hopes Alderweireld remains with the club going forward is defensive partner Jan Vertonghen, stressing his compatriot is an important member of their squad – along with the likes of Christian Eriksen, Kyle Walker and Danny Rose.
 "These guys showed their importance for us last season and for a couple of seasons now," he said.
 "I think Tottenham has the power and strength to keep guys like that in the team these days.
 "I really hope they all stay and we can all push together for something very nice next season."

Gyms and fitness centers are also allowed to open their doors, but with several restrictions in place. Gym staffers must screen customers in person or by phone at the door for symptoms of illness, and once inside, patrons must be kept at least 10 feet apart from each other. Team or group activities are prohibited, locker room and shower areas are to remain closed except for restrooms and sinks, all equipment must be disinfected after each use, and the use of touch pads or sign-in sheets cannot be required.
 Those at higher risk of COVID-19 infection are urged to stay away from gyms, and anyone who enters is encouraged to wear a face mask.
 The revised order also adds specific instructions for self-isolation and quarantine of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 or have been exposed to someone who has tested positive.
 While violators can still be charged with a misdemeanor, the order has been updated to request that enforcement officers issue warnings rather than citations, especially for first offenses.
 “The purpose of this Order is to protect individuals’ health, not to hold them criminally liable,” the order states. “However, repeat or egregious offenders may be cited and charged.”
 In a prepared statement, BRHD Director Lloyd Berentzen said the department realizes it can be difficult to follow social distancing guidelines, “but we are optimistic that individual efforts are helping to flatten the curve.”
 A copy of the public health order can be found online at brhd.org. Questions should be directed to the Bear River Health Department at (435) 792-6500.
