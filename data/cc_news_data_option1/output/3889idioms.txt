The secret to beating the Ravens is to jump out to an early lead and that's exactly what the Chiefs did in this game. After marching down the field and getting a field goal on their opening possession, it looked like Baltimore was ready to win a shootout, but then the wheels fell off the wagon after that. Once the Ravens fell behind, the offense got out of its element and looked uncomfortable for the rest of the night. Although Lamar Jackson had a great game on the ground with 83 rushing yards, he had an abysmal game through the air, completing just 15 of 28 passes for 97 yards. Defensively, the Ravens had no idea how to stop the Chiefs offense. The Chiefs kept Baltimore guessing all night in a game where Kansas City converted 10 of 13 third downs while racking up 517 total yards.

It's not often that a starting quarterback gets benched after leading his team to a 2-0 start, but that's exactly what happened to Mitchell Trubisky on Sunday. After two-and-a-half quarters of watching his team play disastrous offensive football, Bears coach Matt Nagy decided to pull the plug on Trubisky in favor of Nick Foles. And like pretty much every story that involves Nick Foles coming off the bench, this one worked out well as Foles led the Bears to a shocking 30-26 win in Atlanta.
 With the Bears trailing 26-10 in the third quarter, Nagy finally decided to bench Trubisky after watching his quarterback throw an interception on Chicago's first possession of the second half. By bringing in Foles, Nagy was clearly just hoping to spark his offense, and that's exactly what happened. After working through some rust in the third quarter, Foles caught fire in the fourth quarter, leading the Bears on three touchdown drives. On those three drives, Foles went a combined 9 of 12 for 119 yards and three touchdowns.
 Foles would have had a fourth touchdown, but a play that was originally ruled a simultaneous possession score for the Bears was overturned after review and ruled an interception. A possible fifth touchdown on a different drive also almost happened, but an Anthony Miller TD was ruled incomplete after a review.
 Once Foles went into the game, the Bears looked like they had a different offense. Foles loves to push the ball downfield, and most of the time his deep gambles pay off, like when he hit Anthony Miller for a 28-yard score that ended up being the game-winning touchdown with 1:53 left to play.

Joseph Fiumara isn’t sure if it’s because of recent wildfires or that people are worn out about COVID-19, or both.


  Whatever the case, the director of Umatilla County Public Health told county commissioners Monday, the number of people getting tested for the coronavirus is down.


  “Across the state, test numbers are down,” Fiumara said as he briefed county officials, adding that people are exhausted and not seeking testing for the disease.


  The county’s public health officer, Dr. Jonathan Hitzman, seconded that, noting that his private family practice is no longer getting many calls related to the virus.


  Although that can change, Fiumara and Hitzman agree it’s likely the situation reflects that there are only so many people in Umatilla County are in the high-risk category, and the coronavirus has hit those populations and moved on.


  “I think we’re going to see low numbers for a while,” Hitzman predicted, but cautioned this is not cause for relaxing precautions.


  “We’re also coming into flu season,” he said, noting mask-wearing will be necessary into the spring because of influenza.


  However, Umatilla County residents are practicing greater compliance with the mask mandate, the physician pointed out, and being much more careful about safety measures is becoming second nature to people.


  Fiumara said he’s been cautioning his staff as colleges and schools experiment with physical reopening, along with people doing group activities, case numbers can rise again.


  Those have been climbing elsewhere, he added.


  Monday the county reported 24 more people diagnosed with COVID-19 since mid- day Friday, for an overall total of 2,833 cases. Three people are currently hospitalized, officials said.


  As well, Oregon education officials announced last week it is allowing countries to ignore September’s test positivity rates in considering school building re-openings, Fiumara told county commissioners.


  Rob Manning, in reporting for Oregon Public Broadcasting, said the move opens the door to in-person instruction in places where the number of weekly positive case numbers are within allowable limits.


  "This means that schools will rely only on the case rates and case counts,” said Oregon Department of Education Director Colt Gill.


  Gill cautioned education officials, Manning wrote, that as case rates appear to rise again in Oregon, “it is vitally important that you review the case rate and case count trend in your county prior to making any decisions to return to in-person instruction.”


  In Walla Walla County, Department of Community Health officials said Monday morning there are were 905 residents identified as having COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic.


  On Friday there were nine new cases, two on Saturday, seven on Sunday and one as of 10:30 a.m. Monday.


  That number had changed to 906 people by the afternoon, with two new cases for Monday.


  Out of 51 active cases of the illness, one person is hospitalized, one is an inmate at Washington State Penitentiary and two are employees of the prison.


  Health workers are still seeing a lot of household transmission of the virus, officials said, noting that a partnership with Providence St. Mary Medical Center was providing resources for families to stay home and not expose others.


  Columbia County health officials are reporting a total of 14 cases of the illness, and none active at this time.

With the Bank of Mexico forecasting a drop in GDP of up to 12.8% this year and the vaccine against covid-19 still to come, uncertainty remains about the speed of the comeback. The Mexican government's fiscal response to the crisis has been one of the weakest in the region, according to the International Monetary Fund. Of the 12 million workers who lost their jobs in April, 5.4 million are left out of the labor market. And the trend points to a slowdown. In July, INEGI registered the return of 1.5 million workers, more than double the number in August, a sign that the reopening of the economy after the lockdown continues to bear fruit, but at a slower pace.

The Sonoma Marin Area Rail Transit (SMART) Board of Directors has spent the past month going on a listening tour of areas along the train’s current or projected path. Last week, Cloverdale had an opportunity to participate in a listening session.
 Thus far, the board has had sessions in Santa Rosa, Windsor and Healdsburg as well.
 “I know that there is a tremendous amount of interest and we want to inform you about what our expectations are, what our needs are and we also want to hear some updates from you,” Councilmember Melanie Bagby said at the start of the meeting.
 The question of the night is one that’s been swirling around down since the train’s inception — can Cloverdalians expect to see the SMART train come to Cloverdale, and what needs to be done to help get it there.
 “What do we need to do to better communicate our plans, our potential for development that exists within our urban growth boundary? What is it that we need to do to better communicate with the SMART board and other municipalities to answer the concerns I think, rightfully so, about our population levels being worth the financial investment in coming all the way to Cloverdale?” posed Bagby, a longtime advocate for the train who also sits on the board of the Sonoma County Transit Authority.
 In response, Sonoma County District 2 Supervisor and SMART board member David Rabbitt said that federal and state money for transportation is harder and harder to come by, especially as discussions about transportation become more partisan.
 “Because the dollars have become so scarce, I think it’s also the cost-benefit factors that have come into play and everything is competitive,” Rabbit said. “We have a lot of things to make sure that we can communicate when we’re trying to make the best case of why we can continue going north — including that cost-benefit analysis and what it can bring to the communities of Cloverdale … it’s challenging.”
 One action proposed by board member Debora Fudge is having the city contact Lake and Mendocino counties to determine how many people from those counties may use the train to head south.
 “It isn’t just about Cloverdale, it’s about Lake and Mendocino counties as well,” Fudge said.
 Bagby said that she thinks the city has that information in-house, but that she would look to the county and the SMART board to reach out to those counties on Cloverdale’s behalf, especially considering the city’s limited resources and staffing capacity.
 One of the barriers to getting the train to Cloverdale is first getting the train to Healdsburg. When it comes to getting the train over the river in Healdsburg, SMART General Manager Farhad Mansourian said that they have money from the SMART extension to Windsor to conduct an analysis about going further north.
 One of the analyses that has been done is how to cross the river in Healdsburg in a more economical way, Mansourian said, noting that they have reduced the cost of the bridge substantially and “in the very near future we’ll be coming out with the components of what it takes to go to Healdsburg.”
 Cloverdale resident Renee Roe said that she purchased her home in Cloverdale in the hopes that the train would come to town.
 “One of the selling points was the SMART train and from what I’m hearing from other citizens who are paying property taxes, we feel like there’s very little hope that we’ll ever see in our lifetime the SMART train come to Cloverdale, so it’s hard for us to get behind additional taxes if we’re not going to benefit. I do strongly feel that Cloverdale can benefit, we’ll see more people move to Cloverdale as well as more tourism if we bring the train to Cloverdale,” Roe said.
 “That’s the part that’s still unclear to me,” Roe said during a later part of the meeting. “I was looking at the sales tax that didn't pass, so what else is needed? I’m not a transportation person, but is it grant writing? Is it how do we look for the funding? What can the city do? The city council, the mayor and what can the residents do to help? It seems like we need to have a plan for the city of Cloverdale, instead of just continuing to wish it would come.”
 Rabbitt said that those who want to see the train in Cloverdale should voice support for the train and its associated measures, and that the council should write letters backing SMART measures and plans, and voice support at the state and federal levels when the rail service seeks federal and state funding.
 Cloverdale does present a challenge, however, he noted, since the cost-benefit analysis involves the high cost of getting the train to town but doesn’t promise high rider numbers, due to the size of the city.
 “We continue to work on that. We continue to advocate … to drive home that point that this is a very important project and make sure that it’s included. We look at trying to include it in several different ways,” he said.
 Cloverdale resident Gene Marcinkowski, who takes the SMART train south for volunteer work, asked if SMART’s proposed freight line would help SMART’s bottom line. Rabbitt said that it likely would, and that freight could only help.
 SMART’s Measure I on the March 2020 ballot, which would’ve helped sustain the train using an extended ⅔ cent sales tax but didn’t guarantee further movement north, failed to gain traction with voters. The measure needed to have a 66% ‘yes’ vote and only received 52.34%. Locally, precincts in Cloverdale reported 50-53% ‘no’ votes for the measure. Areas predominantly voting yes on the measure included Healdsburg, central Santa Rosa, Petaluma and areas outside of the train’s path, like west county and Sonoma.
 Another suggestion brought up during the meeting included thinking about marketing the city as a destination that people could take the train to, rather than a city that would be using the train for primarily commuter purposes for people heading south.

If you blow a lead of 15 points for a second straight week, you get an 'F.' Those are the rules here. A big reason this loss happened is because the Falcons offense absolutely disappeared in the fourth quarter. Matt Ryan didn't complete his first pass of the quarter until there was under two minutes left, and shortly after he did that, he threw a pick that sealed the win for Chicago. If we learned one thing about the Falcons in this game, it's that no lead is ever safe in Atlanta, no matter how big.      ##  Cleveland 34-20 over Washington
