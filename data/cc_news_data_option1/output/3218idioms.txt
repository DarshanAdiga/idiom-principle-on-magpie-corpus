With a new moon Aug. 18, we have the promise of skies as dark as they get, offering a view of the Milky Way.      A view from a truly dark rural site on a very clear night can be astonishing for anyone not accustomed to such skies. The billowing Milky Way arches through the summer evening sky, with a myriad stars - ranging from bright to very dim, sparkling over your head and on every side.      Yet it's a great time to look even in semi-rural conditions. The Milky Way is so bright, it may still be dimly seen, and the constellations are impressive as always.      Note: A hazy atmosphere will hide most of the Milky Way. Also, avoid street, town and neighborhood lights as much as you can.      Most brilliant of all this summer is the planet Jupiter and, to the left of it, planet Saturn, also very bright. Our giant neighbors in the outer solar system stand out in 2020, beacons of the night sky and easily seen even in an urban sky.      Do what you can to trace the Milky Way. Looking at around 10 p.m. in mid- August, once the sky is dark, the Milky Way stretches from the northeast, creating a backdrop for the famous W-shape of the constellation Cassiopeia, reaching overhead through the Northern Cross (part of Cygnus the Swan), down through Aquilia the Eagle and leading to Sagittarius and Scorpius in the south (low in the south if viewed from mid-northern latitudes).      It is here, in the area of Sagittarius, where the Milky Way is widest. We are literally looking at the central hub of the great spiral galaxy where we live, known collectively as the Milky Way.      The rest of the Milky Way band, which completely encircles the sky, is made up of the spiral arms of this galaxy. The sun and its planets - including Earth - is right in the midst of these arms, about halfway from the edge towards the central hub. We have an inside look at the arms, which from our perspective are overlapping and blend together.      With even a simple pair of binoculars or a telescope of any size, sweep across the Milky Way and see how this hazy band bursts into faint stars. Obviously, the larger the telescope and depending on how dark and clear your skies are, the more you will see and enjoy.      Part of Sagittarius constellation, the stars marking the outline of the "Teapot" is well placed, with the puffy-appearing Milky Way seeming to rise like celestial steam from the Teapot's "spout."      Just with the naked eye, observe how the Milky Way band is curiously split as you look up from the southern sky and Sagittarius, up through Aquilia and Cygnus.      What you are seeing is not a gap, but evidence of a cast, dark nebula of dust obscuring the light of the distant spiral arm stars in the background. You may be a fastidious housekeeper and keep chasing away dust bunnies, but the fact is, dust is everywhere. Dust, as well as gas, permeates the galaxy; from certain nebulous regions, stars are formed.      As you explore the Milky Way deeper with binoculars or a telescope, you can find many more dark nebulae, which are plotted on detailed star atlases.      Also abundant through the Milky Way band are star clusters, some rich and bright, some sparse, some dim and small, but each fascinating to fathom and compare. These star clusters are gatherings of stars, siblings as it were, from the same nebulous star cradle, on their journey in space - bound by gravitation and, I like to muse, mutual affection.      Look for the many-colored stars. White, blue-white, orange and red are common. They bespeak of stellar "life cycles" and variations in temperature, luminosity, chemical makeup and age. Many stars vary in brightness. We are also concluding that most may have planets of their own, evoking our imagination.      Use a star map to delve into the central hub, in the south on a mid-August evening. There are several bright and beautiful nebulous clouds (with names such as the Lagoon, Trifid, Horseshoe and Eagle), "star clouds" and amazing star clusters.   Jupiter and Saturn adds to the heavenly show, to the left of the "Teapot."      This show is free and waiting for you to go out and see.      Keep looking up at the stars!

Farr said that when Trump gives himself sky-high grades for his handling of the once-in-a-century health crisis -- which he is widely accused of botching -- "it would be a joke if it were funny. But it isn't." "He does not give a feeling of having a coherent plan," said Farr.


  \- The pandemic changed Florida \- Randy Pestana, an expert in electoral politics at Florida International University, said of the turn toward Biden among older Floridians, "I genuinely do believe it's a trend." And he said the pandemic is a factor.


  "If you look at older voters who are most vulnerable to COVID impacts health- wise, they're starting to see that the response has not been good and now their economy is not doing good, their retirement is not doing good," said Pestana.


  "And oh, by the way, their health is really at risk," he added.


  \- Trump needs Florida badly - "A lot of Republicans that voted for Trump are just sick of it. They're tired. Every day is something new, every day is another tweet," said Pestana.


  US Congressman Ted Deutch, a Democrat who represents a Florida district with one of the heaviest concentrations of retirees, told AFP that "for every issue that seniors care about, Donald Trump's policies have been disastrous." "His failure to respond to the pandemic has been deadly for older Americans," said Deutch.


  Elections in Florida are famously hard to predict and tend to be decided by very thin margins that keep the rest of the country on tenterhooks.


  That means every vote counts. Voters switching party allegiances, even in small numbers, can make a huge difference.


  Hardly anyone forgets that a margin of 537 votes in Florida proved decisive in sending George W. Bush to the White House in his presidential battle against Al Gore in 2000.


  "I wouldn't expect a mass exodus of older white Republican voters abandoning Trump, but even a small change could impact the outcome," said Binder.


  Because of the quirks of the US presidential voting system, the winner in a state's popular vote takes all of its electoral votes, no matter the margin of victory. That means Trump needs the 29 electoral votes assigned to Florida to hang onto his job.


  The Trump campaign insists that Trump followers remain loyal and the president is "leading an enthusiastic and unified Republican party."

IL CASO   TREVISO Per una settantina di ospiti si profilava l'uscita dalla caserma Serena e la fine della quarantena perchè risultati negativi al Covid 19. Sarebbe servito però il secondo test, a conferma della negativizzazione. Dovevano farlo ieri pomeriggio. Ma un gruppo di richiedenti asilo, gli stessi secondo i gestori che stanno fomentando i disordini degli ultimi mesi, ha preso il sopravvento. «Vogliamo uscire, vogliamo uscire» si sono messi a urlare quando gli operatori hanno comunicato loro gli esiti dello screening di mercoledì. Alcuni dei migranti, risultati ancora positivi al covid 19, hanno preso il sopravvento e hanno aggredito due operatori di Nova Facility, strattonandoli e costringendo la polizia ad intervenire in forze e a portare fuori tutto il personale. È stato l'inizio della protesta, una trentina in tutto i protagonisti, durante la quale via Zermanese è stata chiusa al traffico. «Sono stati lanciati sassi e oggetti in strada, rischiavano di colpire le auto in transito» hanno spiegato polizia e carabinieri, che hanno dovuto negare l'accesso, per motivi di sicurezza, al personale dell'usl che avrebbe dovuto effettuare gli ultimi test agli ospiti già negativizzati e per i quali si sarebbe a breve profilata l'uscita dalla caserma e la fine della quarantena. Invece tutto da rifare, tutto da programmare, in una condizione in cui le tensioni sembrano crescere di giorno in giorno.   LO SCREENING   Eppure il pomeriggio era iniziato con notizie di certo confortanti, almeno per una buona parte dei profughi dell'ex caserma Serena. Mercoledì gli operatori dell'Usl avevano effettuato 255 tamponi di cui 230 agli ospiti e 25 agli operatori. Una cinquantina, nell'occasione, i migranti che si sono rifiutati di sottoporsi al test, per protesta. Rispetto allo screening precedente, in cui erano emerse 233 positività tra i richiedenti asilo e 11 tra gli operatori, la situazione è fortemente migliorata: 155 richiedenti asilo positivi e 71 negativi (4 da riprocessare). «Dei 71 negativi 63 erano positivi in occasione del controllo precedente - ha spiegato il direttore generale Francesco Benazzi - e ai negativizzati verrà fatto un nuovo tampone che, se negativo, consentirà di rimuovere le misure restrittive nei loro confronti». Stesso discorso per gli operatori, 7 i positivi e 18 negativi di cui 8 precedentemente contagiati. Il secondo test era in programma per ieri pomeriggio, e sarebbe stato solo un antipasto in attesa di un nuovo screening previsto già per martedì su tutti i profughi. Ma quando in caserma sono stati comunicati i risultati di mercoledì scorso, la situazione è sfuggita nuovamente di mano.   I DISORDINI   «Il coronavirus non esiste, ora andiamo tutti fuori» si è messo a urlare un gruppo di migranti dopo aver saputo di essere ancora positivi al Covid 19. Ne è nato un parapiglia, l'operatore che stava leggendo gli esiti è stato strattonato ed aggredito, e così il collega intervenuto in suo aiuto, preso alle spalle da un ospite e scagliato a terra. Gli agenti presenti 24 ore su 24 nel presidio esterno alla Serena, sono intervenuti subito, facendo uscire tutti gli operatori dalla struttura. Ed è in quel momento che una trentina di ospiti hanno preso il sopravvento, scagliando oggetti all'esterno e vandalizzando, stando a quanto riferito, stanze e uffici. Polizia e carabinieri hanno chiuso via Zermanese al traffico e si sono schierati in assetto anti sommossa davanti ai cancelli. Impossibile, in quelle condizioni, permettere agli operatori dell'Usl di entrare per effettuare i tamponi sui negativizzati. Sono stati rimandati a data da destinarsi, facendo così allungare i tempi dello svuotamento della Serena che, pur con le sue difficoltà visto quanto accaduto giovedì in via Pisa, risulta in questo momento necessario prima di tutto da un punto di vista sanitario. Alla Serena, ieri pomeriggio, sono arrivati anche il questore di Treviso Vito Montaruli, che ha seguito da vicino le trattative fino al rientro in serata degli operatori di Nova Facility in caserma, e il sindaco di Treviso Mario Conte. «La misura è colma una volta finita la quarantena i delinquenti vanno mandati a casa» ha detto il primo cittadino riferendosi a quei 10 migranti, fomentatori delle proteste dello scorso giugno e, a quanto pare, anche della rivolta di ieri pomeriggio, per i quali sarebbe già pronta la revoca dell'accoglienza, rimasti però, per ora, impuniti.

“These are longer-term rates, but rates in general across the board, 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, have all come down over time this year,” he said.
 The only other action taken by the council was to approve a change to the city’s retirement policies.
 The change, which was also recently approved for Lincoln municipal employees by the city council there, will see Pell City give employees considered to be tier II by the Employee Retirement System the same benefits given to those in tier I.
 Tier I employees are individuals hired before 2013. They are considered to have somewhat more favorable retirement benefits, including being able to retire at age 60 with 10 years of service or when they reach 25 years of service. Tier II employees are required to be age 62 and have at least 10 years of service.
 Muenger said the city has 54% tier I employees and 46% tier II employees.
 Mayor Bill Pruitt said the change will require the city to contribute more to retirement for employees, but he said it would not be a large increase.
 “It’s miniscule,” Pruitt said, adding the city had been looking at the issue for a long time.
 Muenger also said the increase in cost is balanced by a 1.5% increase in employee contributions to retirement, which brings general employees to 7.5% and police and fire to 8.5%.
 Council President James McGowan said during the meeting the move was good for city employees due to the increased benefits.
 Fire Chief Tim Kurzejeski and police Chief Paul Irwin also said it would help them in recruitment and employee retention

Scott A. Gray, chairman of the Jefferson County Board of Legislators, was on one of his daily COVID-19 calls on Tuesday when he was stunned at what state officials had to say.
 A judge in Erie County recently ruled in favor of a wedding venue that wanted to operate at 50 percent capacity. The lawsuit against the state argued they should be able to operate at 50 percent capacity during ceremonies, not the 50-person limit like the state mandates. They won that lawsuit, and during the call, Mr. Gray asked for the state’s interpretation.
 He said they said it was their opinion that the lawsuit pertains exclusively for that plaintiff, that specific venue and that single event.
 “I couldn’t believe what I was hearing,” Mr. Gray said. “Everyone knows a lawsuit sets precedent.”
 In a time when schools across the country are making plans to open, Mr. Gray said he doesn’t understand that small businesses like bowling alleys, gyms and wedding venues can’t open under lighter restrictions.
 “How,” he said, “do you expect these businesses to continue withstanding not being open after four months?”
 Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced on Friday that bowling alleys would be able to open next week. Mr. Gray said it appears guidance for alleys to reopen are in a draft stage and being finalized.
 “Please note that as soon as we have guidance related to bowling alleys, we will circulate,” a text from the governor’s office reads.
 Meanwhile, the wedding venue lawsuit argued that restricting wedding ceremonies to 50 people violates their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights for free exercise of religious gatherings. It argues that being allowed to operate at 50 percent capacity when it is running as a restaurant, but having a 50-person restriction when the same venue is used as a wedding reception is arbitrary.
 In response, the state argued that the 50-person gathering ban highlights the state’s emergency police power over matters of health and safety. They also argued that the wedding venues offered no facts for why more than 50 people are required to be present at their ceremonies in order for them to exercise their religious beliefs. And the state argued that the plaintiffs’ free exercise of religious claims cannot succeed because the 50-person gathering restriction is neutral and applies to all weddings, secular or otherwise.
 In its decision, the court cautions that it is not implying that any wedding would be similar to a typical dining experience. It states that this lawsuit is unique because the venues are already operating as a restaurant as well as a wedding venue, and that allowing them to operate both at 50 percent capacity wouldn’t violate their constitutional rights.

The Islanders received goals from five different players (Nick Leddy, Matt Martin, Brock Nelson, Cal Clutterbuck, and Anders Lee) and played their frustrating brand of defense that at times rendered the Capitals' offense completely useless.

The Happiness Curriculum has already shown positive improvements in relationships both in and outside of classrooms in Delhi schools. Students are more reflective about small arguments with their peers, and more insightful in understanding home dynamics. We are excited to see what other changes will take place in the long term and how it may inform policies nationally and internationally. At its heart, the Happiness Curriculum is designed to ensure that the well-being of students and their teachers is front and center in learning and thriving. This was beautifully captured by one young student: “I have learned to notice my mother’s emotions of happiness, sadness, and anger, and when she looks sad, I have learned to support her, hug her, and be there for her.”

Inside cars queued on public school campuses across Lenoir County this week, parents and students waited patiently while teachers worked like carhops during a lunch-hour rush, serving up iPads, collecting forms and answering questions through face coverings that, like everything else in these scenes, said health and safety considerations will shape the school year that begins Monday.
   
 Lenoir County Public Schools is reopening, like the majority of public school districts in the state, with an extended period of remote learning, where LCPS teachers will connect to students through the Zoom communication app, through live and recorded instruction and, to monitor their progress, through an array of apps, school email and regular telephone calls.
   
 After nine weeks - the initial period of remote learning set by the Lenoir County Board of Education - public health metrics tied to the spread of the coronavirus in the county will determine how many, if any, students will return to their school buildings. Even if the Covid-19 transmission rate abates enough to allow in-person instruction, students are likely to return to school on a staggered schedule, pairing time in the classroom with time learning from home.
   
 "We all want to see students return to school as soon as safely possible, but until that day arrives, we will meet them where they are, and if that means having them log onto Zoom from their living rooms, that is what we will do," Michael Moon, principal of EB Frink Middle School, said.
   
 On Tuesday and Wednesday, as vehicles snaked along Frink's circular drive, Moon, his teachers and staff distributed district-issued iPads to about 85 percent of the school's nearly 600 students. On Thursday and Friday, school personnel worked to make contact with the remaining students "to schedule pick-ups and make home visits to deliver instructional materials so students can be successful from Day 1," the principal said.
   
 In repeated phone calls, emails and texts delivered for more than a week, principals of LCPS's 17 schools have emphasized to families the importance of students logging in for the first day of instruction. Unlike the 10 weeks of remote learning provided last spring, when the coronavirus closed the state's public schools in mid-March, the upcoming period of remote learning will include two trademarks of in-school instruction: taking attendance and assigning work for grades.
   
 Attendance will be determined by student log-ins, participation in class activities and completion of lessons. Schoolwork will be assigned for grades at the discretion of the teacher, but with an eye toward the "unique character of remote learning" and guidance "for teachers that emphasize the importance of frequent communication, meaningful feedback and regular assessments in evaluating student progress," according to a frequently-asked-questions section about remote learning on the school district's website.
   
 For the 20 percent or so of students whose families do not have reliable broadband connection, the district is providing learning packets and preloading iPads with lessons and assignments that can be accessed without the internet. The district also plans to distribute through schools a limited number of hotspots, which can provide connectivity for families within range of cell service, and point students to a number of park-and-learn sites with open internet systems - its own campuses, among them - and to accessible internet at locations like Neuse Regional Library branches in Kinston, La Grange and Pink Hill.
   
 "We're all facing unique challenges. Remote learning is unlike anything we have seen before, and it is going to be substantially different from the virtual learning phase that we implemented in the spring," Moon said. "We are focused on creating procedures, routines and expectations that will maximize students' learning experiences. I have never seen teachers work as hard as they're working now to prepare live 'synchronous' lessons and pre-recorded 'asynchronous' lessons to support student learning."
   
 LCPS got a leg up on remote learning when, six years ago, it made iPads and learning management apps like Seesaw and Canvas a routine part of classroom instruction, according to district administrators. With students and teachers already familiar with the technology and the process of digital communication, the district's curriculum leaders were able to turn their attention this past spring and particularly over the summer to content and presentation techniques.
   
 In June a corps of teachers underwent intense professional development sessions with nationally renowned educational leaders in math and reading instruction and, with that training, created a library of hundreds of prerecorded lessons and passed that knowledge on to colleagues at their schools. The result is instruction, both live and recorded, that more closely mirrors in-person learning, according to Melissa Lynch, the district's digital learning instructional coordinator.
   
 "LCPS has increased the rigor and expectations with remote learning," Lynch said. "Students will be taught on-grade level, new information during remote learning classes and will participate in live classroom experiences and recorded mini-lessons."
   
 A typical day of remote learning will begin with live instruction via Zoom and alternate live and asynchronous instruction on a set schedule. A period of more than an hour is designated at the end of each day for "office hours," when teachers can communicate one-on-one with students and parents and provide tutoring.
   
 On Wednesday, as he sat in the car with his mother waiting to receive his iPad and class schedule at North Lenoir High School - mostly "honors classes," he said - incoming freshman Brent Hill Jr. was still sorting out his feeling about transitioning to high school virtually. "It wasn't the exact idea I thought I would start with," he said. "It is a different environment definitely, but it does beat possibly everyone getting the coronavirus."
   
 His mother, Penny, said the family is shoring up its internet connection and making arrangements for Brent to study at his grandmother's house when his parents are at work. "I feel a little bit better this year. It looks like they've got it organized well," she said of the district's remote learning plan. "I really wished we could have done in-classroom, but the classes he's signed up for look very do-able. We're going to make the most of it," she said.
   
 That attitude, an outlook that combines the promise of effort with expectations of success, will be the key to the successful beginning of this unusual school year, the principal at EB Frink thinks.
   
 "Monday will go a long way toward creating a new, albeit temporary, 'normal' and we need the support of students, parents and our school community to ensure our students are logged in, locked in and ready to hit the ground running," Moon said. "I want our entire school community to know that we are in this together, and we're going to have a successful school year, even if the start is not how we envisioned it."

At this stage of a typical high school football season, coaches throughout the state would be making their final preparations for the start of the fall season. After the spring season was canceled due to COVID-19, the fall represented a fresh start.
 But the coronavirus isn’t done wreaking havoc, and as a result, fall sports in New York are in peril.
 As of now, the fall sports season is set to begin on Sept. 21, that is if Gov. Andrew Cuomo gives the OK. The delay will give school districts about a month to adjust to a new way of learning that will involve a reduced in-person presence from students (for most north country schools) along with social distancing and wearing masks at practices.
 However, some local high school coaches admit that they aren’t optimistic for the fall start.
 “I just don’t see it happening in the fall, I think it’s too big of a risk and you see all of the colleges are starting to cancel,” Indian River football coach Cory Marsell said. “If one kid gets sick does the whole team go in quarantine? So do you have to give up two games? Those are all huge questions and huge concerns that nobody really has an answer to right now, or at least I don’t.”
 There are multiple situations that suggest that the New York State Public High School Athletic Association will be forced to go to Plan B, condensing all high school sports into three seasons that will be played between January and June. But college athletics may dictate the direction of high school sports.
 Earlier in the week, two of the power five conferences, the Big Ten and the Pac-12, announced that they will not play any sports during the fall semester, including football, and instead try to play come the spring.
 “(College football) was kind of like our last beacon of hope, I think, if college football could continue, and we play on a much more local level than they do,” Thousand Islands football coach Ryan Kendall said. “I think (college football is) looking at Major League Baseball and it’s just not working. So my gut feeling is that (there probably won’t be a fall season), but I’m holding out hope. That’s all we can do.”
 Marsell said he would hope to know whether or not a season is happening at least a couple of weeks before the Sept. 21 date so he could have meetings with parents and so Indian River can adequately prepare for what will be a strange year of football.
 If high school football is given the green light and the season can begin on Sept. 21, while elated, coaches still have questions on how it would operate in the COVID-19 era — and also how it will end. If played in the fall of 2020, there would be no fall state championship, but each section could attempt to play sectional playoffs. With a full regular season schedule of seven to eight games, the regular season would end sometime in mid November.
 Carthage football coach Jason Coffman is unsure how that would work.
 “I don’t know how we’re going to keep that Sept. 21st date considering how it’s kind of a 10-week (season), the way I understand it,” Coffman said. “That would put us into November, so I don’t know how that’s possibly going to work, but I’m still optimistic that maybe it will.”
 One of the biggest conversations surrounding the safety of playing football amid a global pandemic is happening at the college level. Nick Saban, head coach at the University of Alabama, said in an ESPN article on Aug. 10 that “players are a lot safer with us than they are running around at home.”
 At the college level, that may be true. It is a more controlled environment with a significant amount of resources, including the ability to test players almost daily.
 The same can’t be said of the high school level.
 “It’s not like that in high school, the kids are going to go home every day, we don’t control their lives like a college football coach can. We don’t have a bubble for them to live in,” Coffman said. “So, these kids are going to be thrown into different situations each day. I’m a safety-first person and I’m going to do whatever New York state and our school individually tells us to do.”
 With New York high school fall sports essentially broken up into two plans, one in the fall and one in the spring, Coffman is still pulling for football to happen in the fall.
 “Football is a fall sport,” Coffman said. “You start when it’s really hot and the goal is to be playing when it’s really cold. I don’t think that people realize what the first month of (spring sports) lacrosse, baseball, softball, I don’t think people truly understand what the first month and even two months if you’re in upstate New York, is like. We aren’t out on the field and playing right from the first day, we spend six weeks in the gym sometimes.”
 The dates for the fall spring plan are subject to change, but currently in that condensed season plan, football would start on March 1 and end on May 8.
 However, Coffman believes that, at the moment, starting in the spring is the most realistic plan. Because along with all of the questions and concerns that go into a playing a season, the possibility of not finishing, whether because of a coronavirus outbreak on the field or in the classroom, remains.
 For that reason, Marsell is leaning toward the condensed spring plan.
 “My feeling is that I hope it’s a spring type of situation because in the fall, even if we do start, it’s going to get canceled at some point throughout it and I don’t think that there’s a plan if we start it and then have to cancel it,” Marsell said. “Section 3 has done a great job of putting together a few scenarios according to guidance and planning on going from there. I think personally it’s going to be a shortened season, but if we can get out in spring on March 1st and start practice then, I think it could be a big lift for the whole area and our kids.”
 As Coffman and Marsell both mentioned, starting March 1 brings its own issues. There’s the overlap between seasons, possibly requiring multi-sport athletes to participate in two sports at the same time or choose between them — a decision that would also apply to some coaches — and there’s the facilities.
 Poor weather, which is almost considered a given in this part of the state during March, could force teams to practice indoors. A large football team practicing in a gym isn’t ideal amid the coronavirus.
 “I see complications too with trying to run a preseason for football indoors,” Lowville football coach Josh Coffman said. “It’s a little different for colleges who have indoor facilities and fieldhouses and stuff like that whereas if you’re doing varsity and JV for us, that’s 60 guys in the gym trying to get them ready to go depending on how the weather is through March.”
 If the NYSPHSAA elects to go for the spring plan, it will give coaches, and a players, a few more months to figure out how to safely play sports in the 2020-2021 school year. But as of now, the Sept. 21 start day is still Plan A. The fall season is set to begin in 37 days, roughly five-and-a-half weeks away.
