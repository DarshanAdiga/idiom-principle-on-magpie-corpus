 Times-News staff
 JAMESTOWN, N.Y. — A Jamestown, New York, woman was killed in a one-vehicle accident near Jamestown on Friday.
 Carol Boyer, 65, was pronounced dead at the scene after the vehicle in which she was a passenger hit a tree off the Busti-Sugar Grove Road near the Pennsylvania state line in Lakewood, New York, at about 6:30 p.m., according to Lakewood-Busti police.
 The driver, Joseph Wisnewski, 51, also of Jamestown, was heading south on the Busti-Sugar Grove Road when a deer ran in front of the vehicle. Wisnewski swerved to avoid it, and the vehicle hit a tree head-on, police said.
 Wisnewski had to be extricated from the vehicle.
 Boyer was riding in the front seat. Two back-seat passengers, boys ages 2 and 13, suffered minor injuries, police said.
 The boys and Wisnewski were taken to UMPC Chautauqua for treatment.
 Busti and Lakewood fire departments and Chautauqua County EMS assisted police at the scene.
