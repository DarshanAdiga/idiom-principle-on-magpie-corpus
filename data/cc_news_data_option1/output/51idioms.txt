If people would rather pay for subscriptions such as Netflix instead of traditional television channels through cable packages, Disney and other media companies figure they might as well try to get some of that money directly.

WESTPORT -- The steel is up and it looks good.
 This phrase, in some form, has been said with excitement lately by School Building Committee members.
 The steel frame of the proposed 187,000 square foot building is now in place at the Old County Road construction site.
 Project officials noted that the delivery of the steel before Jan. 1 was an important step toward keeping the building on pace toward a September 2021 opening. As of Jan 4., the steel frame of both the middle school and high school sections of the building were clearly visible from Old County Road. One could easily see the steel outline of the incoming school.
 "It is good to see the steel going up," School Building Committee member Antone Vieira Jr. said last week, while steel construction was beginning.
 "The SBC meetings deal with issues that need to be discussed and addressed, but the public also needs to know the SBC members and contractors are all working hard to make this a project everyone will be proud of," Vieira added.
 "I drove by yesterday after having been out of town for a couple of weeks: Amazing," SBC Chairwoman Dianne Baron said. "It means that this is really happening and that we are on our way to realizing a dream that for a long time seemed out of reach--a new, state of the art middle/high school which will be life changing for our students, teachers and community as a whole. (It is) still on time and under budget."
 Owners project manager Dan Tavares said the importance of starting steel before January 1 was pivotal because it provides the contractor the appropriate time to get the building fully enclosed and protected before next winter and bad weather.'
 "By next year at this time, roofs, windows and exterior veneer should be completely in place so interior finishes can occur in the building without potential damage due to moisture and other elements."
 Despite this good news, project officials have encountered roadblocks and there still appears to be more. The state Department of Environmental Protection has taken issue with the location of the proposed well, which appears to be too close in radius to the elementary school's well and nearby residential properties.
 At the next meeting on Jan. 8, project officials will discuss other options, including the possibility of digging a new well on an adjacent camping grounds site, which is being purchased by the town.
