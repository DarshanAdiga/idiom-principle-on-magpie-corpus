Scores of redevelopment projects have been delayed by unscrupulous builders and many are in limbo. But that is not the only problem affecting the homeowners. To add insult to injury, the tax department has, in most cases, taxed the hardship compensation received by the homeowners in the hands of the homeowners themselves and also in the hands of the society. The homeowners thus end up paying tax twice on the same hardship compensation -- first in their individual capacity and then their pro-rata share to the society. Some societies and homeowners litigate against the demand but must pay the notorious 20 per cent of the demand in both places -- once as a homeowner and once as a member of the society.

The stakes are high for for a momentous political struggle in Georgia during President Donald Trump's final lame-duck days in office. The state is closely divided, with Democrats making gains on Republicans, fueled by a surge of new voters. But no Democrat has been elected senator in some 20 years. As much as $500 million could be spent on the two races, one strategist said.


  “Now we take Georgia, and then we change America,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told a crowd celebrating Biden's victory Saturday on the streets of Brooklyn.


  With a Democratic majority in the Senate, the party that also controls the House would have a firm grasp on power in Washington. Biden would have latitude over nominees, including for his Cabinet, and a chance to push major portions of his legislative agenda through Congress. If Democrats fall short, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, could wield the power to check Biden's ambitions.


  “The Senate is the last line of defence,” tweeted the National Republican Senatorial Committee as soon as the presidential race was called for Biden. It was a fundraising appeal.


  Republicans have been working to retain their majority, but even if they secure the final two races where ballots are still being counted in North Carolina and Alaska, they would still fall short of the 51 seats needed.


  In North Carolina, Sen. Thom Tillis is trying to fend off Democratic challenger Cal Cunningham in a tight race that is too early to call. Alaska GOP Sen. Dan Sullivan is favoured for another term against Al Gross, an independent running as a Democrat.


  The political math problem for Republicans is that the vice-president of the party holding the White House casts the tie-breaking vote in the Senate. Next year that would be Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris. That means 50 seats for Democrats would result in control over the chamber. But Republicans would need 51 seats to cement their hold on power.


  That would put Georgia centre stage, as many expect is about to happen.

For more than 30 years Plymouth South athletic trainer Carol Petrell has made sure that high school athletes in Plymouth always get the best care when they need an ankle taped or a bump on the head checked out.
 "I'm there to help out the coaches the best that I can. Being an athletic trainer is still fun for me. I love being around the teams and helping the kids," this week's 50-for-50 profile said. "You never want to see an injury happen, but I want to be there to help out if something should pop up."
 The 56-year-old joked that she was "a child of double-sessions" while attending Plymouth-Carver in the early-1980s, sometimes practicing in the morning with the rest of the underclassmen while some of their teammates were in classes. During that time there were also many Saturdays spent back at the high school playing games.
 "I loved playing sports, so it got to be kind of natural for me. That's just the way things were back then," Carol said. "Because of double-sessions some of us were practicing in the morning and some others were in the afternoon, but we did our best to make it all work."
 She played three seasons each with the basketball and softball programs at P-C. Petrell usually took the fall season off from sports but made an exception for her senior year when she was part of something historic.
 In the fall of 1980, Athletic Director Henry Cryer approached boys JV soccer coach Dennis Azevedo with a proposition. Cryer had a goal of beginning the town's first high school girls soccer program and he wanted Azevedo to coach the team.
 Azevedo accepted the offer of leading the brand new team in 1981. And soon enough Carol was on board with him.
 "I was at a basketball camp during the summer before that first season and a couple of girls said they were going to go out for the team. They wanted me to join the team with them, and I told them the only way I would do it is if I got to play goalie, because I'd be able to use my hands," Carol said.
 A deal was struck and Carol became one of the 44 players who were part of Plymouth's first girls soccer team. She won the starting goaltender spot and was elected a team captain along with Karen Reinhart and Patty Heanue.
 "That season was a blast," she remembered. "I have a competitive edge to me, and the chance to be a part of something new was really exciting to me."
 Azevedo agrees with Carol's assessment of her competitive nature.
 "I've known Carol over the years on a lot of levels. As a student, a player on my team, as a colleague and now as a personal friend," said Azevedo, who is the godfather to Carol's daughter Meghan. "One thing I can tell you is that she's always had a competitive streak to her, no matter what she is doing."
 As Carol was getting ready to leave Plymouth-Carver with the Class of 1982 she took some advice from her old coach about exploring the possibility of athletic training. Carol followed that road, graduating from Bridgewater State in 1989 with a Physical Education degree and a certification in athletic training.
 "I saw Carole's work ethic and her love of athletics, and I thought that a career in something like athletic training would be a great way for her to stay connected to the game. I thought she'd really take to the profession," Dennis said.
 They say timing is everything. At the same time Carol was leaving college in 1989, Dr. R. Scott Oliver was working on a project to get an athletic trainer into the local school systems. Carol took the spot and she worked for Rocky Gomes and Cryer in both Carver and Plymouth that first year before focusing just on the Plymouth schools starting in 1990.
 Carol's also worked full-time as a physical education teacher at Norwell Middle School for the last 20 years, starting her day at that school before heading back to Plymouth for any afternoon or night games.
 "My two daughters (Katelyn and Meghan) pretty much grew up on the sideline at Plymouth North," Carol said. "It was great working with the athletes each day and having my two kids right there with me."
 When Meghan (Class of 2010) and Katelyn ('12) got to Plymouth North they were both starting defenders on the school's varsity girls lacrosse team during Meghan's senior season. Carol stepped away from her athletic training duties that year so she could watch her two daughters play together.
 "That chance wasn't going to happen again, and I didn't want to miss the opportunity. Watching them play together is my fondest memory from all my years of being around Plymouth sports," Carol said. "Time goes by quickly, and I really felt like I needed to be there to support the both of them and enjoy the moment."
 She wasn't out of the game for long, through. Carol would soon come back to be the athletic trainer for Plymouth South, and she's still there today, ready to lend a hand wherever she's needed.
 "Carol has been a great ally for all the coaches and athletes over the years," Plymouth South Head Coach Scott Fry said. "When I was the head football coach I always knew my players were in good hands when Carol was working with them."
 Fry added, "She has a great way of forming strong relationships with kids, and they respond to her because she tells them the truth. It's amazing how many athletes come home from college and stop by the high school just to say hello and check in with Carol. It's a great thing to see."
 Carol said she was pleased to see how the role of an athletic trainer has changed over the years.
 "The need has always been there to have an athletic trainer around to help out with the athletes, and I think the town of Plymouth has done a great job of protecting its athletes over the years. Schools have come a long way over the years to get to the system we have in place now," Carol said. "There is very good communication between trainers. If something happens at an away game I'll usually get a message telling me to look out for something if one our athletes had an issue."
 Each week during 2020, the 50-for-50 project will profile a Plymouth person or state championship team that positively impacted the town in the last 50 years. To nominate someone, email Sports Editor David Wolcott Jr. at dwolcott@wickedlocal.com with information on the nominee.

Some wanted Congress to choose the president, while others vouched for a democratic vote of the people. Eventually, they landed on a system which dictated that a number of electors from each state would be responsible for voting for the president, and that the electoral number would be pursuant to the given state's population.


  Texas A&M political science Professor George Edwards notes that the electoral college was never meant to be the perfect system, but rather something that was slapped together out of fatigue. "They were tired, impatient, frustrated. They cobbled together this plan because they couldn't agree on anything else," he told History.


  More problems came about when those politicians worried that states where enslaved people made up a gigantic share of the population -- such as Virginia where 60% of the population was enslaved -- would get too many electors. So, the founders had to find middle ground, leading to the infamous Three-Fifths Compromise. They decided that Black enslaved people would count as three- fifths of a person when considering a state's population, and therefore its electors.


  The Three-Fifths compromise, a function of the electoral college, sought to devalue Black presence in America. 233 years later, the Three-fifth compromise is gone, but the legacy of suppression remains with us.

After he spoke, the cars at the drive-in rally — a pandemic campaign invention — began to honk their horns and a fireworks display lit up the night sky. Biden was on track to win the national popular vote by more than 4 million, a margin that could grow as ballots continue to be counted.Nonetheless, Trump was not giving up.Departing from longstanding democratic tradition and signaling a potentially turbulent transfer of power, he issued a combative statement saying his campaign would take unspecified legal actions. And he followed up with a bombastic, all-caps tweet in which he falsely declared, “I WON THE ELECTION, GOT 71,000,000 LEGAL VOTES.” Twitter immediately flagged it as misleading.Trump has pointed to delays in processing the vote in some states to allege with no evidence that there was fraud and to argue that his rival was trying to seize power — an extraordinary charge by a sitting president trying to sow doubt about a bedrock democratic process.Trump is the first incumbent president to lose reelection since Republican George H.W. Bush in 1992.He was golfing at his Virginia country club when he lost the race. He stayed out for hours, stopping to congratulate a bride as he left, and his motorcade returned to the White House to a cacophony of shouts, taunts and unfriendly hand gestures.In Wilmington, Delaware, near the stage that, until Saturday night, had stood empty since it was erected to celebrate on Election Night, people cheered and pumped their fists as the news that the presidential race had been called for the state’s former senator arrived on their cellphones.On the nearby water, two men in a kayak yelled to a couple paddling by in the opposite direction, “Joe won! They called it!” as people on the shore whooped and hollered. Harris, in workout gear, was shown on video speaking to Biden on the phone, exuberantly telling the president-elect “We did it!”Across the country, there were parties and prayer. In New York City, spontaneous block parties broke out. People ran out of their buildings, banging on pots. They danced and high-fived with strangers amid honking horns. Among the loudest cheers were those for passing U.S. Postal Service trucks.People streamed into Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House, near where Trump had ordered the clearing of protesters in June, waving signs and taking cellphone pictures. In Lansing, Michigan, Trump supporters and Black Lives Matter demonstrators filled the Capitol steps. The lyrics to “Amazing Grace” began to echo through the crowd, and Trump supporters laid their hands on a counter protester, and prayed.Americans showed deep interest in the presidential race. A record 103 million voted early this year, opting to avoid waiting in long lines at polling locations during a pandemic. With counting continuing in some states, Biden had already received more than 75 million votes, more than any presidential candidate before him.Trump’s refusal to concede has no legal implications. But it could add to the incoming administration’s challenge of bringing the country together after a bitter election.Throughout the campaign, Trump repeatedly refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power, arguing without evidence that the election could be marred by fraud. The nation has a long history of presidential candidates peacefully accepting the outcome of elections, dating back to 1800, when John Adams conceded to his rival Thomas Jefferson.It was Biden’s native Pennsylvania that put him over the top, the state he invoked throughout the campaign to connect with working class voters. He also won Nevada on Saturday pushing his total to 290 Electoral College votes.Biden received congratulations from dozens of world leaders, and his former boss, President Barack Obama, saluted him in a statement, declaring the nation was “fortunate that Joe’s got what it takes to be President and already carries himself that way.”Republicans on Capitol Hill were giving Trump and his campaign space to consider all their legal options. It was a precarious balance for Trump’s allies as they try to be supportive of the president -- and avoid risking further fallout -- but face the reality of the vote count.On Saturday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had not yet made any public statements -- either congratulating Biden or joining Trump’s complaints. But retiring GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who is close to McConnell, said, “After counting every valid vote and allowing courts to resolve disputes, it is important to respect and promptly accept the result.”More than 237,000 Americans have died during the coronavirus pandemic, nearly 10 million have been infected and millions of jobs have been lost. The final days of the campaign played out against a surge in confirmed cases in nearly every state, including battlegrounds such as Wisconsin that swung to Biden.The pandemic will soon be Biden’s to tame, and he campaigned pledging a big government response, akin to what Franklin D. Roosevelt oversaw with the New Deal during the Depression of the 1930s. He announced that, as his transition kicks into high gear, he would on Monday appoint his own coronavirus task force.But Senate Republicans fought back several Democratic challengers and looked to retain a fragile majority that could serve as a check on some of Biden’s ambitions.The 2020 campaign was a referendum on Trump’s handling of the pandemic, which has shuttered schools across the nation, disrupted businesses and raised questions about the feasibility of family gatherings heading into the holidays.The fast spread of the coronavirus transformed political rallies from standard campaign fare to gatherings that were potential public health emergencies. It also contributed to an unprecedented shift to voting early and by mail and prompted Biden to dramatically scale back his travel and events to comply with restrictions. The president defied calls for caution and ultimately contracted the disease himself.Trump was saddled throughout the year by negative assessments from the public of his handling of the pandemic. There was another COVID-19 outbreak in the White House this week, which sickened his chief of staff Mark Meadows.Biden also drew a sharp contrast to Trump through a summer of unrest over the police killings of Black Americans including Breonna Taylor in Kentucky and George Floyd in Minneapolis. Their deaths sparked the largest racial protest movement since the civil rights era. Biden responded by acknowledging the racism that pervades American life, while Trump emphasized his support of police and pivoted to a “law and order” message that resonated with his largely white base.The third president to be impeached, though acquitted in the Senate, Trump will leave office having left an indelible imprint in a tenure defined by the shattering of White House norms and a day-to-day whirlwind of turnover, partisan divide and Twitter blasts.Trump’s team has filed a smattering of lawsuits in battleground states, some of which were immediately rebuffed by judges. His personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was holding a news conference in Philadelphia threatening more legal action when the race was called.Biden, born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and raised in Delaware, was one of the youngest candidates ever elected to the Senate. Before he took office, his wife and daughter were killed, and his two sons badly injured in a 1972 car crash.Commuting every night on a train from Washington back to Wilmington, Biden fashioned an everyman political persona to go along with powerful Senate positions, including chairman of the Senate Judiciary and Foreign Relations Committees. Some aspects of his record drew critical scrutiny from fellow Democrats, including his support for the 1994 crime bill, his vote for the 2003 Iraq War and his management of the Clarence Thomas' Supreme Court hearings.Biden’s 1988 presidential campaign was done in by plagiarism allegations, and his next bid in 2008 ended quietly. But later that year, he was tapped to be Barack Obama’s running mate and he became an influential vice president, steering the administration’s outreach to both Capitol Hill and Iraq.While his reputation was burnished by his time in office and his deep friendship with Obama, Biden stood aside for Clinton and opted not to run in 2016 after his adult son Beau died of brain cancer the year before.Trump’s tenure pushed Biden to make one more run as he declared that “the very soul of the nation is at stake.”___Associated Press writers Will Weissert in Wilmington, Delaware and Jill Colvin and Lisa Mascaro in Washington contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.
