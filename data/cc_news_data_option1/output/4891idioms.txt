Do people not know what exactly happened with the Suarez case or something?      Firstly, Suarez never said or admitted to saying Negrito. It was "Negro".      Secondly, in the hearing it was explained that in the way Suarez admitted to saying it was in-fact not racist or offensive, so if the FA actually believed Suarez's version of events, he would never have been charged. However, they believed Evra's side of the story in which he accused Suarez of saying a multitude of things that were actually racist.      I don't know how anyone can see this and not laugh at the complete absurdity of it. Cavani, a Spanish speaking Uruguayan, using a term of endearment in Spanish  to his Spanish speaking Uruguayan friend and people are truly trying to say it's out of order because it kinda of closely resembles a world that has negative connotations because of its use mainly in the US?

FORT WORTH, Texas
 Marcus Sasser scored 17 points playing close to home, Quentin Grimes added 15 and No. 17 Houston never trailed in a 64-53 victory over 14th-ranked Texas Tech in a neutral-site Texas meeting Sunday.
 Sasser, whose career high of 26 points came at SMU in Dallas as a freshman last season, was 5 of 15 from the field as the Cougars (3-0) overcame 35% shooting at Dickies Arena. That's where they are set to play in the American Athletic Conference tournament this season near downtown Fort Worth and not far from the Dallas suburb where Sasser grew up.
 A 3-pointer from Grimes opened the scoring and put the Red Raiders behind for the first time this season. Texas Tech (2-1) went six minutes without scoring in the first half and trailed by 18 just 12 minutes into the game.
 Mac McClung scored 16 points but missed all six of his 3-point tries for the Red Raiders, who shot 22% from long range. Freshman Micah Peavy had 12 points.
 Sasser put the Cougars up 53-33 with a 3 before the Red Raiders went an 11-0 run midway through the second half, the first nine points coming on free throws before a dunk by Peavy.

A boater missing off the east coast of Florida was found alive Sunday, clinging to his capsized boat about 86 miles from shore.
 The US Coast Guard said Sunday afternoon that the crew aboard a motor vessel found 62-year old Stuart Bee and took him aboard around 11 a.m.
 Bee had departed Cape Marina in Port Canaveral around 4 p.m. Friday on his 32-foot boat named the Stingray, according to the Coast Guard. He was reported missing Saturday by a member at the marina who said Bee typically doesn't stay out overnight on his boat, the Coast Guard said.
 "Saving lives at sea is our highest calling. This is a truly incredible outcome that demonstrates the bond among all mariners and our community," said Capt. Mark Vlaun, commanding officer of Sector Jacksonville. "Thank you to our mission partners that launch into action and to all who got the word out to find and rescue Mr. Bee."

Apple has removed Boot Camp from macOS 11, which many used to boot their Mac hardware into Windows 10. The promise was that virtualisation could be used to emulate any machine as required. Which is what developer Alexander Grad has achieved, but with a twist. The version of Windows running on the new M1 Macs is Microsoft’s ARM version Windows 10. Hartley Charlton reports:

Back in the real world, the twist is emulation. Both macOS and Windows 10 need to bring developers on board to release ARM native applications. Until that point both platforms are relying on emulation to run older applications. Windows 10 on ARM only supports 32-bit applications, with 64-bit support (covering the majority of applications) expected in beta shortly and generally in ‘early 2021’. As with any emulation, performance is lower than running native applications, and will have a hit on battery life.
