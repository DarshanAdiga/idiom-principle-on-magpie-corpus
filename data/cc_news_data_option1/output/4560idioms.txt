"I’ve always been drawn to reusing common objects that are sculptural, like an old ladder from the side of a boat or used for apple picking repurposed as a towel rack or to hang throw blankets, or a pair of old jugs made into lamps.

The church and its magnetic leader, a descendant of pioneering pastors who preached to cowboy stars from a bygone Hollywood age, seem to revel in their contrarian role. When the county slapped a lawsuit against MacArthur and the church in mid-August, he quickly formed a legal team — including a senior legal adviser to President Trump’s reelection campaign — and kept holding services indoors. When a judge sided with health officials in mid-September and ordered the church not to meet indoors, MacArthur mocked the county’s health guidelines. And in a September appearance on the “Ingraham Angle” on Fox News, MacArthur seemingly dared authorities to throw him in jail.
 Grace’s attendance has not suffered, even as a second wave of infections looms and outbreaks of the disease continue to be reported across the country, including an outbreak in Shasta County at an evangelical church’s ministry school. At times, Grace has been so crowded, people had to stand in the back, according to court records.
 MacArthur and church attorneys declined to respond to repeated requests for an interview. MacArthur, in the Fox News interview with host Laura Ingraham, stood his ground. “Our church is literally flooded with people. We have them in every nook and cranny jammed together,” he said, saying worshippers are attending “to hear the message of forgiveness and salvation in a time when fear is being propagated on every street.”
 Members of the church interviewed by The Times, most of whom declined to provide their full names over privacy concerns, gave a wide range of reasons for agreeing with the church’s stance.
