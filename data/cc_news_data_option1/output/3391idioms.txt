It also depends on Republicans acting as a unified front on immigration. So far, pro-business Republicans aren’t challenging the restrictions and travel bans Trump has imposed during the pandemic, and as the US continues to grapple with its worst economic crisis since the Great Depression and more than a million Americans are out of work, they will likely continue to follow the president’s lead. But in the long term, they might find themselves at philosophical odds with the anti-immigrant wing of the party.

We would be doing all right, but a teammate would fall and losing that member would create a chain reaction. Not enough damage would be dealt or the team would rush over to resurrect them.

The show follows a group of teens in Nebraska, 10 years after the outbreak of the zombie apocalypse, meaning it focuses on the first generation to come of age after the end of the world as we knew it. Perhaps wisely, the showrunners have already announced that it will run for just two seasons, meaning it should — hopefully — avoid the fate of its two open-ended TV predecessors which, most agree, have already run too long.

NEW YORK (AP) — The shared moped service Revel, which suspended service in New York City after three deaths, is returning to city streets with new rules including a 21-question safety test, the company announced Thursday. “Revel was born and bred in New York City, and we’re proud to relaunch in our hometown with an even better service,” Revel chief executive officer Frank Reig said in a news release announcing the return of the blue scooters that were seen as an alternative to taxis and subways during the coronavirus pandemic. The scooter startup suspended New York City service on July 28 after two fatal crashes. A third Revel rider who was injured before the shutdown died later. Two of the three people who died were not wearing helmets, officials said. Revel's new rules will require riders to provide a selfie of themselves wearing a helmet in order to rent a moped. Before taking their first ride, Revel users will also have to watch an instructional video and take a 21-question safety test, answering each question correctly twice. City transportation commissioner Polly Trottenberg praised the new safety rules and said her department \"will closely monitor Revel’s operations during this relaunch and, going forward, plans to work with all interested stakeholders to promulgate rules to govern the operation of shared moped services in New York City.” Revel was founded with 68 mopeds in 2018 and had 3,000 in New York when service was suspended. A company spokesperson said the full fleetis expected to return over two to three weeks. In addition to New York, Revel operates in Oakland, California; Austin, Texas and Washington, D.C. Service in Miami has been suspended by city order. Revel said new riders in its other locations will need to take the safety test as well, while existing users will have until Sept....

 # Leimon's Pizzeria enjoys serving customers in Adel
 Becky Carlyle - Correspondent
 Leimon’s Pizzeria has been serving guests their award-winning pizza since 1994. This summer, the pizza can be found in Adel.
 “Our ‘office views’ are county fairs, state fairs, music festivals, car shows, and more, but our long, grand, love affair for pizza might be too cheesy to share here,” Rebecca Leimon said.
 Leimon and her husband, Dan and family, own Leimon’s Pizzeria. Dan started the business with carnival game trailers in 1969, the same year he received his teaching license. Every summer, on the last day of school, Dan would hit the road to travel throughout the Midwest, staying in Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Leimon joined Dan on their traveling journey in 1984.
 “My husband and I enjoyed our teaching careers, but couldn’t wait to spend our summers traveling to county fairs and carnivals throughout the Midwest,” Leimon said. “In 1994, we took a leap of faith and opened Leimon’s Pizzeria.”
 To purchase their first pizza wagon, they sold all the game trailers. Today, they have three custom-built pizza trailers and a fry trailer. Inside the trailers, they have commercial ovens and fryers. One of the pizzeria trailers is currently in Adel, next to Lincoln Savings Bank on Nile Kinnick Drive.
 “Our son Bryan [Enloe] led the way tossing pizza from day one,” Leimon said. “It’s been a wild ride working together over the years.”
 In 2010, Enloe’s wife, Jennie, joined the traveling lifestyle. One of Enloe’s sons, Joe, is following in his dad’s footsteps by working at the family pizza business.
 Pre-COVID-19, their schedule flowed like clockwork, with only a few new events added each year.
 “We would start in south Texas in early spring and travel the Midwest all summer long, working our way south in the fall,” Leimon said. “As we traveled year after year, each county started to feel like home.”
 Before COVID-19, they would often split up their trailers and be at multiple events at one time, but Leimon enjoyed having all three trailers back together again at the Iowa State Fair.
 “I think one of the hardest emotional blows this year, is the loss of the Iowa State Fair,” she said.
 For over 25 years, thousands of past FFA ushers, wearing yellow shirts, would stampede from the grandstand down Rock Island to their pizza trailer by the swine barn. The FFA ushers would grab a few slices of pizza after a long day showing animals and working the grandstand.
 “It was always the highlight of our year,” she said. “We believe in these hard-working kids. Each year, we would host pizza parties for them and issued scholarships annually. Seeing so many familiar faces here in Adel, is mending that missing piece of our hearts this year.”
 Leimon’s Pizzeria has been coming to Dallas County for the last decade. Leimon shared Adel is one of their favorite communities. She feels that having a mobile business and lifestyle has given them countless opportunities to meet some of the most amazing people nationwide, from all different walks of life and backgrounds.
 “The folks around here are genuine, true,” Leimon said. “We made some great friendships over the last 10 years here. As the world and our industry was shutting down, our good friends encouraged us to bring our pizza here to Adel and how could we argue.”
 To set up their pizzeria in Adel, they first wanted to keep a stellar reputation within the community. They installed a power pole to power their trailer and also worked with the city and state health departments.
 “Our family is praying to be able to stay until our equipment can’t take the colder temperatures,” Leimon said. “We also have confirmed our arrangements to come back as the spring flowers bloom.”
 To ensure customer safety during COVID-19, they spent a lot of time with state inspectors to implement best practices. They also check temperatures before each shift, installed barriers and continue to practice sanitizing and safe handwashing.
 To prepare their pizzas, they use quality ingredients and their pies are made fresh to order for pick up. They also offer single slices that are always hot and ready for on-the-go needs. They encourage people to bring their own chairs to sit and eat over on the grass by their stand.
 “Our award-winning Jalapeno Popper Pizza has been a huge hit in Adel,” Leimon said.
 They also serve a cauliflower crust, meat lovers and fresh veggie toppings. They recently brought sizzling funnel cakes, hand dipped corndogs, gooey Ellsworth cheese curds and real fresh cut French fries.
 “[It] all pairs well with our fresh lemonade,” she said.
 Leimon would like to thank Dallas County for welcoming them into the Adel community over the years.
 “We are happy to serve you and will do our best to always make you smile,” she said.
 Leimon’s Pizzeria is currently open 4-8 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 4-9 p.m. Friday, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Saturday and 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sunday. This week, the business will also be open from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. The hours are subject to change. Updates are posted on the Leimon’s Pizzeria Facebook page.
 To schedule a pizza party, call 515-981-3845 to request a pick-up time.

Paris, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 27th Aug, 2020 ) :The novel coronavirus has killed at least 826,512 people since the outbreak emerged in China last December, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP at 1100 GMT on Thursday.
 At least 24,229,710 cases have been registered. Of these, at least 15,578,100 are now considered recovered.
 The tallies, using data collected by AFP from national authorities and information from the World Health Organization (WHO), probably reflect only a fraction of the actual number of infections.
 Many countries are testing only symptomatic or the most serious cases.
 On Wednesday, 6,344 new deaths and 268,230 new cases were recorded worldwide. Based on latest reports, the countries with the most new deaths were the United States with 1,249 new deaths, followed by Brazil with 1,085 and India with 1,023.
 The United States is the worst-hit country with 179,743 deaths from 5,823,685 cases. At least 2,084,465 people have been declared recovered.
 After the US, the hardest-hit countries are Brazil with 117,665 deaths from 3,717,156 cases, Mexico with 62,076 deaths from 573,888 cases, India with 60,472 deaths from 3,310,234 cases, and the United Kingdom with 41,449 deaths from 328,846 cases.

People sometimes find a way to solve one problem (in this case finding a “clever” financing option), without thinking about the possible consequences of that solution. This is one of those cases where speaking to an experienced maritime lawyer before the transaction will save money in the long run.

In 1998, two suspects in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya were brought to the United States to face charges. (Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-‘Owhali (moh- HAH’-mehd rah-SHEED’ dah-ood ahl-oh-WAHL’-ee) and Mohammed Saddiq Odeh (sah- DEEK’ oh-DAY’) were convicted in 2001 of conspiring to carry out the bombing; both were sentenced to life in prison.)
 In 2005, coastal residents jammed freeways and gas stations as they rushed to get out of the way of Hurricane Katrina, which was headed toward New Orleans.

In February of 2002, Army chief of staff Eric Shinseki told the Senate Armed Services Committee that occupying Iraq would require “several hundred thousand soldiers.” Furious, Rumsfeld deployed Wolfowitz to the Hill to rebut Shinseki. Wolfowitz said the four-star general’s estimate was “wildly off the mark” (it wasn’t) because the Iraqis “will greet us as liberators, and that will help us to keep requirements down.” He added the war would be near costless, because Iraq’s oil exports would pay for the bulk of reconstruction. Shinseki was shortly thereafter forced into retirement.

VATICAN CITY (AP) — Two authoritative religious bodies on Thursday called on Christians to band together to fight “sins” laid bare or aggravated by the pandemic, including racism and economic injustice. The Vatican and the World Council of Churches, which is based in Switzerland, issued a joint document noting that the COVID-19 outbreak has drawn attention to \"the scandalous gap between the rich and the poor.” The document declared that Christians are compelled to work to heal inequalities, including between men and women. Christians must “own up to our own complicity and guilt in many systems of oppression” and resist the “temptation” to blame the poor for their poverty, it said. The inter-religious appeal encourages reflection during the pandemic about the “scourge of religious intolerance, discrimination, racism, economic and ecological injustice and many other sins.” Preparing the document for the Vatican was the Pontifical Council for Inter-religious Dialogue. The effort reflects Pope Francis' push for Christians to stress their common values in working to combat environmental degradation and to help those on life's margins, such as migrants. The World Council of Churches brings together churches, denominations and church fellowships in more than 110 countries and territories, representing more than a half-billion Christians. The document cites the New Testament parable of the Good Samaritan as inspiration to “overcome religious prejudice and cultural biases in relation both to those whom we serve, and to those with whom we serve, as we strive to alleviate suffering and to restore healing and wholeness in a pluralistic world.” Citing the gap between rich and poor, the appeal said the pandemic has “exacerbated racial prejudices and led...

"The wind is still over 50 mph. It’s going to have to drop significantly before they can even run any emergency calls. We also need daylight,” Gremillion said in an interview with KPLC-TV.
 More than 580,000 coastal residents were ordered to join the largest evacuation since the coronavirus pandemic began and many did, filling hotels and sleeping in cars since officials didn't want to open mass shelters and worsen the spread of COVID-19.
 But in Cameron Parish, where Laura came ashore, Nungesser said 50 to 150 people refused pleas to leave and planned to weather the storm in everything from elevated homes to recreational vehicles. The result could be deadly, since some houses weren't raised high enough to withstand the massive storm surge.
 “It’s a very sad situation,” said Ashley Buller, assistant director of emergency preparedness. “We did everything we could to encourage them to leave.”
 Becky Clements, 56, didn't take chances; she evacuated from Lake Charles after hearing that it could take a direct hit. With memories of the destruction almost 15 years ago by Hurricane Rita, she and her family found an Airbnb hundreds of miles inland.
 “The devastation afterward in our town and that whole corner of the state was just awful,” Clements recalled Wednesday. “Whole communities were washed away, never to exist again.”
 Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Pete Gaynor urged people in Laura's path to stay home, if that's still safe. “Don't go out sightseeing. You put yourself, your family at risk and you put first responders at risk," he told “CBS This Morning.”
 FEMA has plenty of resources staged to help survivors, Gaynor said. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards mobilized the National Guard to help, and state Department of Wildlife crews had boats prepared for water rescues.
 Forecasters expected a weakened Laura to cause widespread flash flooding in states far from the coast. An unusual tropical storm warning was issued as far north as Little Rock, where forecasters expected gusts of 50 mph (80 kph) and a deluge of rain through Friday. After turning eastward and reaching the Atlantic Ocean, it could again become a tropical storm and threaten the Northeast.
 Laura hit the U.S. after killing nearly two dozen people on the island of Hispaniola, including 20 in Haiti and three in the Dominican Republic, where it knocked out power and caused intense flooding.
 Laura was the seventh named storm to strike the U.S. this year, setting a new record for U.S. landfalls by the end of August. The old record was six in 1886 and 1916, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.

On Aug. 25, the Cheboygan County Board of Commissioners appointed Ron Williams as the new county commissioner to represent the county's fourth district, filling the seat vacated by the passing of Cal Gouine.
   
 With Gouine passing away while still in office, after having just run unopposed in the August election, the Cheboygan County Board of Commissioners was charged with appointing a replacement for Gouine on its board. The Cheboygan County Republican Party was also charged with finding someone to replace Gouine, to run on the November ballot.
   
 "There was much research done on this appointment by the Republican party, by statute," said Cheboygan County Commissioner Mike Newman. "They've done their homework and put Mr. Williams on the ballot in November."
   
 Newman said there were four other interviews conducted, candidates who had expressed interest in filling the seat vacated by Gouine earlier this month. After all these interviews were completed, the county's Republican party felt Williams was the best fit to fill the seat as a county commissioner.
   
 The county commissioners voted unanimously to approve the appointment of Williams as the newest member of the county board.
   
 At the county commissioner meeting on Tuesday, Williams was sworn into office, joined by his wife Ricci, to whom he has been married for 30 years, and his daughters Caitlin and Taylor, who were home from college.
   
 While he was being sworn into office, Williams promised to support the United States Constitution and the Constitution of the State of Michigan. He also promised to discharge the duties of the office of Cheboygan County Commissioner District Four, in and for the County of Cheboygan, in the State of Michigan, according to the best of his abilities.
   
 "Thank you all," said Williams. "I will do my best not to let you all down."
   
 Each of the county commissioners took their turn to welcome Williams to his new role, representing the citizens of Inverness and Mullett townships as the newest county commissioner.
   
 "Thanks for throwing your hat in the ring, Ron, we really appreciate it," said Cheboygan County Board of Commissioners Chair John Wallace.
   
 He will serve in his new role until the November election, when his name will appear on the ballot to be voted into the position by the residents of those two townships.
   
 "I appreciate the opportunity," said Williams.
   
 In his new position, Williams will be representing the county board as liaison to the county airport authority, civil conservation board, Straits Regional Ride board, veterans services board and waterways committee, as well as serve on the county's millage appropriation committee. Once he gets his feet wet with the new committee appointments, as his schedule with owning his business, Williams Office Equipment in the City of Cheboygan, will allow, he may take on more committee assignments.
   
 Williams is no stranger to serving the public, having been president of the Cheboygan County Fair Board for 10 years, resigning from that position in 2019. He also served as a member of the United States Army for nine years, both active duty and in the National Guard, enlisting in the military after graduating from Cheboygan High School.
   
 He graduated from North Central Michigan College, and has been a resident of Inverness Township, where he has raised his family, for over 30 years.
   
 "I am grateful and honored to be appointed to serve as the district four county commissioner," said Williams after the meeting. "I wish the circumstances of the need for the appointment were different. Cal Gouine was a man of the people, a man of integrity and a patriot. I aspire to serve with those same qualities in his honor."
   
 Williams said that while Cheboygan County does face some challenges, it is his opinion the commissioners, leaders, staff and law enforcement, along with township officials, do an excellent job in maintaining a very complex system. He looks forward to working side by side with them in the continued efforts to improve the lives and futures of county residents.
   
 "We have some difficult issues to tackle, but we have much to be proud of and thankful for," he said. "I am privileged to specifically represent the residents of district four, which consists of Inverness and Mullett townships. To all of you I pledge to be available, willing to listen and willing to work together to maintain and improve our beautiful home. District four is amazingly diverse with agriculture, business and waterfront and we must all work together to protect and enhance it."

But, of course, it all depends on when long haul travel will re-open. In the mid-term, Cordon also predicts that Africa will also be a hub for people seeking holidays off the beaten track. "One trend I think we may see emerge or accelerate from an existing trend is a demand for eco-tourism or tourism in more remote destinations. Africa is really well placed to put itself in the forefront of that," he says.

In celebration of the heart we know our daughter already has, we have set up a donation page to celebrate DDB’s arrival.
