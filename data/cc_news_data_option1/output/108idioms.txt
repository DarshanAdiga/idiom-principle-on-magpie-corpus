Whatever the particulars, there’s a flip side to the disrespectful-Harry-and- Meghan take. Considering that, the comedic edge dulls considerably. Why did Meghan and Harry make their announcement the way they did? What forces led them to this point? There’s been much ado about the fact that Harry “disobeyed” the Queen’s order to not announce anything until the details of their “stepping back” could be worked out. The word “disobey” implies absolute buy-in to the notion that Harry is fully answerable to the Queen regarding his life choices. But if he’s grappling with practical and existential questions about the monarchy and his and Meghan’s roles in it, he may reject the idea that it’s Grandmother’s birthright to call the shots for his life.

If there is a war going on in Iraq between the U.S. and Iran, it probably will not be limited to one country and will engulf the whole region, and potentially, across the world. Washington cannot be counted on to abide by international laws and regulations. The countries in the region, particularly the Gulf States, should also bear in mind that the presence of U.S. bases on their land will not only fail to provide security, but will also endanger their national security as all states who assist the U.S. in any aggression against Iran will become legitimate targets, as Tehran has already warned.

As for Meghan, the vitriol directed at her seems over the top, Piers Morgan's diatribe but one of many. We don't know these people; we can only infer what they're really like and imagine the path to their choices. The Duchess of Sussex might be a saint; she might go home and kick the cat. We just don't know. We do know that after the briefest of honeymoons, the British press took to assaulting her every move, and a wild social media campaign accusing her of faking her pregnancy with a pillow. We know, too, that the adolescent Harry was deeply affected by the press' disgusting and ultimately deadly treatment of his beloved mother Princess Diana, and has been media-wary ever since. Is it a shocker that he's unwilling to look away when another woman he loves is attacked?
