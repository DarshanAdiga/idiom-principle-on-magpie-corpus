TRIPLE DOUBLES Aaron Judge has rejoined the Yankees just in time for the team’s rugged patch -- three doubleheaders in a span of five days. New York’s game against the Braves was rained out Tuesday, creating a twinbill in Atlanta. That will be followed by doubleheaders Friday and Sunday vs. the Mets at Yankee Stadium. “That’s 2020, baby,” New York manager Aaron Boone said. “We’ve got to figure it out. It’s a challenge. Obviously, these seven-inning (doubleheader) games makes it a little more doable, where it’s not as daunting, but there’s no question we’re heading into a tough stretch here.” The Yankees haven’t played since last Thursday. Their three-game Subway Series against the Mets over the weekend was postponed because of coronavirus concerns. Judge and Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. came off the injured list Tuesday. Ian Anderson, the No. 3 overall pick in 2016 and the Braves’ top pitching prospect, had been set to make his major league debut and face Gerrit Cole (4-0), who has a 20-game winning streak in the regular season. CLEVINGER’S RETURN The Indians are ready to give starter Mike Clevinger another chance — and the ball. Cleveland will recall Clevinger to pitch against Minnesota Twins for the first time since he and teammate Zach Plesac broke team rules and Major League Baseball COVID-19 protocols and were demoted for their behavior. Clevinger is 1-1 with a 3.24 ERA in three starts, and hasn’t pitched since Aug. 5. “It’s time to start the healing process with those guys,” said interim manager Sandy Alomar Jr., who is filling in while Terry Francona attends to health issues. “In order to go places, we’re going to need these guys, and also we’re going to eventually need Tito back.” Alomar did not speak to...

CHICAGO (AP) — Lucas Giolito pitched the first no-hitter of the pandemic-delayed major league season, striking out 13 and permitting just one runner in leading the Chicago White Sox over the Pittsurgh Pirates 4-0 Tuesday night. With the seats at Guaranteed Rate Field empty, the hollers of his teammates echoed around the ballpark after right fielder Adam Engel extended to catch Erik Gonzalez’s slicing drive toward the line for the final out. “I’ve been working for this type of game for a while now and it’s really cool that we got it done,” Giolito said. An All-Star last year, the 26-year-old Giolito (3-2) matched his career high for strikeouts set in his previous start against Detroit. Only a four-pitch walk to Gonzalez leading off the fourth inning got in Giolito’s way of perfection. The right-hander threw 101 pitches and made quick work of the Pirates -- Pittsburgh came into the game batting just .229 this season and has the worst record in the majors. The White Sox rushed toward the mound after the final out to celebrate Giolito's first career no-hitter. Giolito was fully aware in the later innings what was at stake. “After the seventh, six more outs, looking at who I was facing, became very, very, very possible,” he said, “and then we were able to get it done.” Giolito said his approach never wavered. “Just staying with the same, like, mental routine for every single pitch. One pitch at a time. Full focus, full execution, straight through the target,” he said. Giolito pitched the 19th no- hitter in White Sox history and first since Philip Humber threw a perfect game at Seattle in 2012. This was the seventh time the Pirates have been held hitless, previously by Washington’s Max Scherzer in 2015. White Sox shortstop Tim Anderson made a...

El servicio de Infraestructuras del Ayuntamiento lleva desde 2017 reclamando a la empresa del agua (Aqualia) una mayor cifra de canon anual que el que la que la empresa viene proponiendo en sus liquidaciones. Los puntos clave de la discrepancia se basaban principalmente en la gratuidad o no de determinados consumos municipales, la cantidad de canon de vertido a pagar y compensar al Ayuntamiento, el coste del agua comprada a Cadasa, asi como la sustitucion y el coste del cambio de contadores. Sobre estos cuatro puntos, las partes han convenido una reinterpretacion de las previsiones contractuales, lo que hace que el monto del importe a ingresar al Consistorio resulte sensiblemente superior al propuesto inicialmente. En total, rondara el millon de euros por las liquidaciones de dos anualidades.
 Segun detalla el concejal del ramo, Nacho Cuesta (Cs) "tambien se han regularizado situaciones como el abono de mantenimiento de fuentes que no estaban en funcionamiento -caso de Longoria Carbajal- o que funcionaban menos horas".
 En este "proceso pactado de revision contractual" se han incluido otras cuestiones importantes. Se trata, añade Cuesta, "del mantenimiento de bocas de riego e hidrantes, que de ahora en adelante realizara la empresa, asi como sentar las bases para llevar a cabo los trabajos, ya muy avanzados, que permitan que las fuentes del campo San Francisco vuelvan a disponer de agua".
 "Entendemos que tras este acuerdo, el contrato queda economicamente mas depurado en todos sus alcances, con la subsiguiente correspondencia en sus liquidaciones", afirma Cuesta. Segun el edil, "supondra para el Ayuntamiento unos mayores ingresos que acabaran redundando en la calidad del servicio de abastecimiento y saneamiento a traves de nuevas inversiones".
 "El ciudadano de Oviedo no tendra a corto plazo mayor percepcion que la de saber que el desde la concejalia de infraestructuras se esta cuidando celosamente del destino de sus impuestos", sentencia Cuesta dentro de su valoracion del acuerdo con Aqualia.

TUCSON, Ariz. (KOLD News 13) - Understanding how cells respond to stress may provide new building blocks for designing future cancer and aging treatments, and a researcher at the University of Arizona has received a $1.6 million grant from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences to further this study.&nbsp;Leading the research is Timothy Bolger, PhD, a research member in the UArizona Cancer Center’s Cancer Biology Program and assistant professor in the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology.His lab focuses on how the critical process of protein synthesis- how proteins are made- is altered when facing adverse conditions, such as a lack of oxygen or nutrients. This is known as cellular stress. When this process is not properly regulated, cancer cells can promote their own growth and survival in tumors.&nbsp;“If a lack of nutrients exists, the protein synthesis response should make enzymes that can make more of the missing nutrient,” said Bolger. “Or if little oxygen is present, that can alter the rates at which the cell uses energy and molecules until normal levels are restored. Sometimes this does not occur, however, and it can have implications for cancer and aging.”&nbsp;Dr. Bolger’s research will utilize yeast models to examine a protein called Ded1 in humans that’s known to speed up chemical reactions in the body, and is known to act differently under cellular stress.He wants to study the activity occurring around this enzyme that causes it to function differently during the protein synthesis response, potentially leading to cancer growth.&nbsp;Mutations to the protein have been linked to several cancers, especially medulloblastoma, a fast-growing form of cancer that occurs in the lower, back part of the brain, known as the cerebellum. Dr. Bolger seeks to determine if those mutations may have an effect on the stress response in the cancer cells.&nbsp;“This is a very fundamental research project right now,” Dr. Bolger said. “But if we understand stress responses, then that may tell us something about how cancer cells are bypassing these stress responses. The knowledge gained could be used in future projects to design therapeutics for those diseases.”&nbsp;Dr. Bolger’s research also investigates the connection between stress response pathways and aging, since the ability to produce a robust cellular stress response has been linked to human longevity.Copyright 2020 KOLD News 13.
