India needs to find a working solution to the border issues with China. China will create an issue if there is none. Hindsight reveals that China can blow hot and cold only to camouflage its ultimate intentions of grabbing more and more lands that are vulnerable and left without solid protection on the southern and southwestern border. New Delhi has taken the right decision of upgrading connectivity of her northern and north-eastern border with China. It was a blunder to have neglected road connectivity in that region for a long time. Now that Ladakh has become a Union Territory, upgrading the infrastructure that will considerably improve our defence position in the region is a priority. In achieving this goal no intimidation from China or Pakistan has to be entertained. This Inner Asian game is not going to come to an end as early as we think.

Without a doubt, the Chinese have been ambitious, to an extent untrustworthy. To build structures and gun position in an apparently disputed area at a time when core commanders are discussing a smooth process for disengagement is hitting one below the belt. More so, when so many lives have been lost in that bloody confrontation on June 15. The Chinese could have been more circumspect now.

Internal documents obtained by The Associated Press show that seawater has entered the engine compartment of the tanker, which hasn't been maintained for over five years, causing damage to the pipelines and increasing the risk of sinking. Rust has covered parts of the tanker and the inert gas that prevents the tanks from gathering inflammable gases, has leaked out. Experts say repairs are no longer possible because the damage to the ship is irreversible.

It is foolish to assume that the Indian Army in Ladakh area are like sitting ducks. To think that our soldiers are not aware of what the Chinese are up to is absurd. On the contrary, Indian commanders are fully prepared to meet any eventuality and react at the shortest possible time. The Ladakh Division has staged forward its vital elements like artillery guns, tanks and of course, additional infantry. There will be contingency plans for any emergency too. Defence is also a form of attack and one need not be cavalier all the times. This is a period of restraint and not get unnecessarily provoked.

Don't go overboard! There were many extra items we were considering and, looking back, they would have been totally unnecessary. One of the biggest blessings in disguise was when an ice cream cart we hired pulled out last minute. Instead we got some amazing gelato from a local ice-cream shop and let our guests self-serve. It saved us a bunch of money and was way easier.
