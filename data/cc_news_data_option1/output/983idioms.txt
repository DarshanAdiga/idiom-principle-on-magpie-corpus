Obviously, I hope that every team in the league recognizes the importance of diversity and inclusion nights, not because they sell tickets, which they do, but even if they didn't, it would still be the right thing to do to make make sure that underrepresented groups in the hockey world feel welcomed and included in our arenas is something that the league takes very seriously. Kim Davis, who heads up all of our diversity and inclusion initiatives for the league, does such an amazing job of constantly advocating both publicly and behind the scenes to keep pushing things along, to keep encouraging everyone to take the next step. And I think we've seen that. I mean, when you look at what the first couple You Can Play nights were where it was, you know, you guys can get 20 tickets and maybe we'll acknowledge you on the scoreboard at some point too, every year now Madison Square Garden is lit up with rainbow lights and the Carolina Hurricanes' Twitter account was phenomenal and aggressively advocating for why diversity and inclusion is important for the Carolina Hurricanes.

Workload management is back in focus ahead of the IPL, in another World Cup year, and the BCCI plans to take extra care of injury-prone players like Shikhar Dhawan, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Hardik Pandya.
 Skipper Virat Kohli had put in a lot of emphasis on workload management before the IPL last year but most players, who were in contention for a place in the 2019 World Cup squad, ended up playing all games for their respective franchisees.
 It has been learnt that the national selectors will sit down during the Irani Cup, which will be held right after the Ranji Trophy final and take a call after checking the workload and medical database of all centrally contracted players.
 "We will communicate our concerns to the respective IPL teams on workload management of the players. We are more concerned about players who are coming fresh from injuries Shikhar, Bhuvneshwar, Hardik, even Ishant (who is not part of limited overs set-up)," a BCCI official told PTI on Wednesday.
 Part of standard practice, India players will be given hand-outs from the national team physio before they join their respective IPL teams, stating the dos and don'ts.
 While the 50-over World Cup happened right after the 2019 IPL, the T20 World Cup will take place in October-November but there are a number of bilateral series lined up before the global event.
 "Though we will monitor the workload of our players closely but we can't force things down on the IPL teams after a point. They want their best players to play, so the onus here lies on the player more than anybody else to avoid burn out," the official added.
 Pandya, who was out of action for more than six months having undergone a back surgery, is set to play his first international game on Thursday since September.
 Bhuvneshwar too was out of action for long after he had to get his sports hernia operated. He too is in the India ODI squad for the South Africa series.
 Dhawan too is back having endured multiple injuries over the past 12 months. There have been question raised over poor handling of Ishant Sharma's ankle injury which recurred during the Test series in New Zealand.

In light of the unusual swings in volatility and alternating risk appetite trends, any bullish attempt in USD/JPY is likely to remain under the microscope for the time being. Indeed, extreme oversold conditions in the pair added to the technical rebound on Tuesday and time will tell whether markets are in the presence of a serious rebound or just another 'dead cat bounce'. On the upside, weekly highs in the 106.00 neighbourhood emerges as the next target of relevance ahead of the critical 200-day SMA in the 108.30 area. If sellers regain control, a breach of recent lows near 101.00 should put the 100.00 support back on the radar.

Vingt ans après avoir découvert Dirk Nowitzki dans le pays du vin allemand, les Dallas Mavericks retrouvent Luka Doncic, un autre acteur générationnel d'Europe de l'Est, dans la ville de Madrid.

 Le hasard de tout cela n'est rien de moins qu'un livre de contes.
 Et comment est-ce pour rappeler que le projet a le pouvoir d'humilier ou d'aider n'importe quelle équipe: si le propriétaire de Mavs, Mark Cuban, n'avait pas renversé le directeur général Donnie Nelson en 2013 quand il voulait prendre un enfant grec maigre nommé Giannis Antetokounmpo, qui le ferait continuer à devenir le MVP en titre, Dallas n'aurait jamais été dans cette position pour commencer.

HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (WAFF) - if you don't want to go out to get your groceries, you can have them delivered through stores or apps like Shipt and Instacart! But soon you could add beer or wine to that list as well. Today lawmakers will discuss a bill which would allow businesses to deliver wine, or hire another business to do it for them.If House Bill 407 passes, businesses will be able to apply for a license from the state. With that license they could deliver beer or wine to their customers themselves. Or they could hire a third party service to do it.We talked with the owner of Uncorked Wine Shop &amp; Tasting Room in Providence. Saranne Riccio tells us well she thinks this is great for customers, it’s not for some small business owners like herself. Right now she just sells wine from her store. She’s concerned this bill would mean extra expenses for her to stay competitive. For example, hiring new employees to deliver the wine and more insurance costs for the vehicles.“If I’m in a situation where if every other shop in town is delivering I’m going to be forced to do the same thing to keep up. So when you think about licensing to allow for delivery, additional staffing that would be necessary. I think for a small independent wine shop, there's a lot of questions to be answered. definitely have the potential to negatively impact our business down the road,” Riccio said. But other local businesses are on board. GrubSouth’s business model is already a delivery service, so of course being able to deliver beer and wine could only increase their sales. GrubSouth started in 2011 working with nine restaurants. You can now order from around 700 restaurants in North Alabama. So if you’re ordering a pizza on the app, you could add a bottle of wine at checkout. GrubSouth business development director, Madeline Sandlin tells me they would love to see the bill passed. And she says it would benefit more than just their bottom line."I think it not only would increase our sales, but it would increase local restaurants' visibility as well. In addition it's something we ultimately think would prevent more DUIs from happening and hopefully save lives. We'll take action in any way we can to propel it forward,” Sandlin said. Wednesday lawmakers from the committee on Economic Development and Tourism are scheduled to read the bill. We will of course give you the First Alert when a decision has been made.

I remember as a young boy going to summer camp and sitting around the camp fire singing, “Make new friends and keep the old, one is silver and the other is gold.” I went home that week and sang that song all around the house until everyone was ready to send me back to camp. And now whether I find myself in the car driving down the highway or sitting on the couch watching TV, that little tune still comes to me whenever it feels like it.
 But what a valuable lesson that little ditty has taught me over all these years: the importance of friendship and real connection. Friendship is a funny thing as the older we get, the less friends we seem to have. In kindergarten, everyone was my friend. In high school, I had a group of people I considered friends. And now, I have a few constant companions throughout this journey we call life. And it’s with those companions that connection and fellowship run deeply.

Australia will be banking on their top order as they seek to end their five- match winless streak in one-day internationals against a buoyant New Zealand in the three-match series beginning in Sydney on Friday.
 Aaron Finch's men are smarting from a 3-0 whitewash in South Africa earlier this month, which followed their 2-1 series defeat in India, and their top order look exhausted after 12 months of relentless cricket.
 In New Zealand, they meet a side brimming with confidence having just whitewashed India both in the ODI and test series.
 Opener David Warner agreed the onus was on the frontline batsmen to fuel Australia's bid to reclaim the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy.
 "The only thing I can put it (Australia's losing streak) down to is the top four not scoring the bulk of the runs," Warner told reporters on Wednesday.
 "You can't do it all the time but at least one of us (has to) go on and be there at the end.
 "It is disappointing but at the end of the day we've got to keep trying to get better at that, try to find a balance with our batting through the middle as well."
 Team mate Matthew Wade agreed with Warner's diagnosis and said they need to do better against a New Zealand side renowned for their discipline in all aspects of the game.
 "We've got to make sure one of the top four really bats through and makes a big hundred and in Australia we back our power towards the end on pretty true wickets," said Wade.
 "It'll be nice to see if one of the top order can go through and bat the whole innings, that would be very helpful."
 New Zealand have welcomed their fit-again pace trio of Trent Boult, Matt Henry and Lockie Ferguson, who powered their run to the final of the World Cup last year.
 Coach Gary Stead said his team considered Australia a "benchmark" but will carry the confidence from their excellent performance against India.
 "They are a great team, we respect them a lot for the way they play their cricket... They set a benchmark for us to aspire to," Stead said.
 "I think we have played some really good ODI cricket in the last three or four years and hopefully we can continue that."
 Sydney hosts the second match as well on Sunday before teams move to Hobart for the last ODI on Friday.
