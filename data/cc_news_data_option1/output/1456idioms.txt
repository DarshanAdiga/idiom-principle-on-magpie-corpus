Amid lockdown, an autorickshaw driver promptly returned costly cardiac medicine and a medical file left behind in the vehicle by a cardiac patient in Moodbidri by tracing the patient after contacting a doctor in Mangaluru on Monday.


  The driver, Yousuf M.K., had dropped a 51-year-old cardiac patient from Moodbidri town to the patient’s village which was about 10 km away from Moodbidri at about 10.30 a.m. Later, when he returned to the town more passengers hired his autorickshaw.


  After returning home in the afternoon, Mr. Yousuf noticed a file and a packet of medicine left behind in the rear seat. Unable to judge whose they could be, he found a medical prescription slip inside the file which had the mobile number of Padmanabha Kamath, interventional cardiologist and professor and head of the department of cardiology at the KMC Hospital in Mangaluru. Dr. Kamath had treated the patient last month. The driver telephoned Dr. Kamath and based on the hospital records the whereabouts of the patient were traced. Later, the driver drove back to the village and returned the medicine and the file to the patient.


  “Unable to recall where he had lost them, the patient was under tension and felt very happy and thanked me,” Mr. Yousuf told _The Hindu_.


  Dr. Kamath said that unable to come to Mangaluru due to the lockdown, the patient had visited a local doctor in Moodbidri with the file for consultation and to purchase medicine.


  “The patient had painstakingly purchased the medicine. This case exemplifies the presence of Good Samaritans in all walks of life and we salute these real life heroes in uniform,” Dr. Kamath said. The lockdown restrictions posed a big challenge to all patients living in villages, especially heart patients, the doctor said.


  Incidentally, Mr. Yousuf had, seven months ago, returned ₹1.05 lakh cash found in a purse left behind by a person from West Bengal in his autorickshaw.

Elizabethtown alum Olivia Farwell on Monday was named a second-team All- American by the National Tenpin Coaches Association.


  Farwell just wrapped a stellar junior campaign at Duquesne University, which finished at No. 8 in the final NTCA coaches' poll.


  It is the third consecutive year Farwell has earned All-American honors, becoming just the fifth Duquesne student-athlete all-time to pull off the feat.


  Duquesne is coached by Penn Manor alum Jody Fetterhoff, who arrived at the school in late 2015 with the task of building a women's bowling program from scratch. Among her first recruits was Farwell, who was set up this season by Cedar Crest alum Allison Hresko. Farwell had come back from an elbow injury near the start of the 2019-20 season and was just hitting her stride as she and the Dukes neared the postseason. That postseason was ultimately cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Celtic captain Scott Brown does not expect Rangers to be a title threat in the Scottish Premiership this season.
 Rangers romped to the Championship title last season to seal their top-flight return, having been demoted to the fourth tier from 2012-13 onwards following serious financial mismanagement at Ibrox.
 Mark Warburton's men beat their fierce Glasgow rivals in the semi-finals of last season's Scottish Cup, but Brown regardless does not expect that upward momentum to carry on into a fight at the top of the table – instead highlighting the strengths of Aberdeen, who have finished as runners-up to the Bhoys in each of the last two seasons.
 "I think Aberdeen after the last couple of seasons," Brown told Sky Sports.
 "They have been exciting to watch, they've come to Celtic Park and got points and we have struggled up there so hopefully we can do a little bit better this season."
 Never shy to get involved in the Old Firm derby's passionate rivalry, Brown said of the fixture's league return: "We'll see that when it comes.
 "It is the fifth game of the season so we have a few games before that and, as I said, Aberdeen have been great the past couple of seasons and so have Hearts as well, coming up last year, so we expect more of the same from those two.
 "It will be good - it is always good, a Rangers-Celtic game, especially in a packed atmosphere but there are lots of huge games for us coming up and that is a way down the line.
 "Last season was a little bit disappointing overall but we still got the job done and hopefully it will be a lot like [that] this year as well. We have started off really well in the Champions League qualifiers and hopefully we can push that on into the league.
 "This is always the number one priority, it is huge for us to try and get six [titles] in a row. We fought well last year and we deserved it after a long, hard season."

Wanting to race close to home, Reyes found everything he was looking for at FSU.


  "Their athletic facilities were outstanding and they had a lot of outlets for their athletes that were out of this world," said Reyes, who plans to major in biology. "I was impressed with everything."


  Currently, Reyes' only stated goal as a college runner is to help the Bulldogs win a conference title before he graduates, which is a seemingly tall task. Fresno State has finished last in each of the last four Mountain West Cross Country Championships and hasn't had an individual runner place higher than 43rd in that stretch.


  But after watching his growth in recent years, Thompson believes Reyes is an ideal building block for a program attempting to change its fortunes.


  “Fresno State is not only getting a great runner, but a person who’s going to change their culture for the better," he said. "He’s a great listener and he’s going to follow, but in his following, he’s going to lead, which I think is what makes a great runner and a person. He’s someone that consistently does the right things."


  Feeling he's just started to do the right things on a routine basis, Reyes says staying on the right track will be critical at the college level.


  "Consistency is key," he said. "So I feel like if I stay consistent, I'll definitely get results."

Daniele De Rossi is determined to bring success to Roma in what could be his final season with his boyhood club.


  De Rossi has only played for Roma in his 15-year professional club career, racking up over 500 appearances in all competitions, but he has just two Coppa Italia titles to show for it, having finished second in Serie A seven times.


  Roma captain and De Rossi's close friend Francesco Totti is also likely to retire at the end of the campaign, having earned a new contract last season with a string of inspirational substitute performances.


  Though De Rossi's future could still remain at the Stadio Olimpico, he is using his contract's expiration as motivation for the impending campaign.


  "The contract? I'm calm, because I'm not thinking whether or not it will be my last year of the contract," he told reporters in the United States as Roma prepare to face Liverpool in the International Champions Cup.


  "These are conversations that I must have with my family, sooner or later I'll have to think about it, but not now.


  "But it could also be the last season, so why not make it the most beautiful of my career?


  "Now I have to forget about it. My goal is to have a great season.


  "I do not think now about what I will do, a mature player must be in step with his physique and every decision we'll take will be taken with clear thought."


  Juventus have won the last five Scudetti and the signing of last season's Serie A top scorer Gonzalo Higuain from runners-up Napoli has done little to suggest that Massimiliano Allegri's men will be stopped in their pursuit of a sixth straight title.


  But De Rossi says a recent trend of underdog victories elsewhere in Europe can inspire his side in 2016-17.


  "Sometimes in football the stronger club doesn't win, but other clubs win," he added.


  "We have the examples of Portugal [at Euro 2016] and Leicester [in the Premier League].


  "We have to work hard and don't think about Juventus or Napoli players, but only of our matches."

Photos shared among emergency room staff at Sinai-Grace Hospital in Detroit show bodies being stored in vacant hospital rooms and piled on top of each other inside refrigerated holding units brought into the hospital's parking lot.
 CNN acquired the photos from an emergency room worker.
 Two other emergency room workers confirm the photos are an accurate portrayal of the scene taking place at the hospital during early April, during one 12-hour shift they describe as overwhelming.
 The ER workers spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity out of concern for their jobs.
 The two sources tell CNN that at least one room, which is typically used for studies on sleeping habits, was used to store bodies because morgue staff did not work at night, and the morgue was full.
 "All I know is we ran out of beds to keep our patients on so we couldn't spare any for the bodies," said one ER worker, who witnessed the bodies in the room.
 In the photo two bodies were put on a bed, side by side, and another body is placed in a chair next to the bed. All three bodies are in white body bags.
 "It was because we hadn't gotten our outside freezers yet, so those rooms had beds and the morgue people don't work over night," said the ER worker.
 In response to this incident, two hospital ER workers tell CNN that the hospital decided to order portable refrigerator storage units to store the bodies.
 On Saturday, CNN visited the hospital. Five refrigerated storage units could be seen in the parking lot.
 And, in another photo obtained by CNN from an emergency room worker, body bags are shown overlapping each other inside a refrigerated unit at the hospital.
 Two other ER workers confirm to CNN that they have personally seen victims placed like this inside the units due to the growing number of bodies.
 They say that blue bags shown in the photo are the personal effects of the deceased.
 "Bodies are definitely double stacked on the floor. There is no lift to help put the bodies on the shelf," said one ER worker who has witnessed similar scenes of bodies.
 In response to a call for comment, hospital spokesman Brian Taylor told CNN, "Patients who pass away at our hospital are treated with respect and dignity, remaining on-site until they can be appropriately released."
 He added, "Like hospitals in New York and elsewhere, we have secured additional resources such as mobile refrigeration units to help temporarily manage the capacity issue caused by COVID-19."
 Six ER workers told CNN that the hospital was treating about 100 to 130 patients at a time during a period in early April when it was at its highest volume. Over the past several days, according to the workers, the case load has dropped significantly to about 50 patients, which they say is a more manageable number.
 Taylor said the hospital was focused on bringing in additional nursing resources to help care for the increase in cases.

Biden said he and Sanders would develop six policy working groups on issues including the economy, education, criminal justice, immigration and climate change to develop solutions to problems the United States faces.
 Trump's re-election campaign used Sanders' endorsement to argue that Biden had moved too far left.
 "This is further proof that even though Bernie Sanders won’t be on the ballot in November, his issues will be," Trump's campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement.
 Biden and his campaign had been reaching out to Sanders and his aides for weeks before he dropped out. Biden and Sanders spoke personally, and Biden had avoided suggesting that Sanders should exit the race, according to a person familiar with that conversation.
 Biden's campaign also had some lower-level talks with the Sanders campaign that included efforts to make clear that there was room for his ideas in Biden’s general election campaign, according to another person familiar with the matter.
 That included conversation between a top Biden aide, Anita Dunn, and a counterpart with Sanders, Jeff Weaver. Neither could be reached for comment on Monday.
 The person said Biden would not be likely to adopt a wide swath of Sanders’ policies wholesale, such as Medicare for All, with which Biden does not agree.
 Yet in recent days, in a clear bid to woo Sanders' supporters, Biden endorsed expanding access to Medicare, forgiving some student debt and making public colleges free for families making $125,000 or less.
 Biden's campaign also reached out in recent weeks to progressive groups, including the Sanders-endorsing Working Families Party to court their support, according to people familiar with those conversations.
 Some activists said they were encouraged both by Sanders’ rapid endorsement, as well as the former rivals' pledge to work together on key issues.
 Sarah Audelo, executive director of Alliance for Youth Action, said the new working groups could help prove Biden is willing to bring on advisers with progressive bona fides in areas such as climate change and immigration.
 But she said the onus remains on Biden to engage young voters who were drawn to Sanders' agenda.
 "We need to see the vice president making a real effort to bring young voters in,” she said. "It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy when candidates say young people won’t vote and then fail to target them."

Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Steineke said the bill would give Evers the flexibility he needs to respond to the pandemic.
 “We applaud the bipartisan work that went into the creation of this important bill,” Vos and Steineke said.
 Much of what the Legislature intends to do is clear the path for spending of more than $2 billion coming to Wisconsin as part of the federal stimulus bill. Key provisions would clear the way for Wisconsin to receive more money for Medicaid, unemployment benefits and more.
 The bill would suspend the one-week waiting period for people to receive unemployment benefits. It would be waived for anyone who applied between March 12 and Feb. 7, 2021. That was a provision Evers pushed to include, given that Wisconsin's unemployment rate was projected to reach record-high levels due to the widespread closures caused by the pandemic.
 As of Monday, 154 deaths people have died from COVID-19 in Wisconsin with more than 3,400 confirmed cases.
 The bill also: prohibits certain insurers from prohibiting coverage based on a COVID-19 diagnosis; attempts to ease the licensing and credentialing process for health care workers, including allowing former providers and those from outside Wisconsin to get temporary credentials; reduces nurse training hour requirements; and makes health care providers immune from civil liability from services provided during the pandemic.
 The bill would also require the state's chief economic development agency to create a plan by June 30 to support the major industries adversely affected by the pandemic, including tourism, manufacturing, agriculture, construction, retail, and services.

Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has stressed Christian Benteke will only be allowed to leave if a club matches their valuation of the Belgium international.
 The 25-year-old has been heavily linked with a move away from Anfield after an underwhelming 2015-16 campaign, with Crystal Palace, Sunderland and Everton all credited with an interest.
 However, Klopp is not willing to let the Belgium international leave on the cheap.
 "Benteke? We will see what happens. If somebody wants a player then they have to pay because we only have good players," Klopp said at a news conference.
 "Christian has already said maybe it makes sense to go to another club. Christian is still a great striker. But we have a few more strikers and I think it makes more sense to give them match time.
 "If there are clubs that want a real striker, they have to make real offers, otherwise we will find solutions.
 "A few clubs try to gamble but we are not part of this, we are serious."
 Liverpool have already brought in a number of players, including Sadio Mane, Georginio Wijnaldum and Loris Karius, but Klopp is ready to add more fresh blood to his ranks if needed.
 "The final word is August 31. Until then you have to be ready to do something on the selling side or the buying side," he added.
 "But I'm fine. The squad is good. We have to see what happens with injuries, you have to be ready to find a solution.

"This is very consistent with how everything for him is personal," said Michael D'Antonio, the author of the 2015 biography "The Truth About Trump." "He filters information not by quality, but by whether it serves his preconceived ideas and his need."


  Trump's determination to be credited for the eventual decision to "reopen" the economy, which will hinge on a consensus by state and local leaders and members of the public that it's safe to ease social distancing efforts, aligns with his instincts as a promoter, D'Antonio said.


  "He is treating this as if the nation is a hotel that had been closed for renovation and is going to have a grand reopening and everyone should be invited," he said.


  Presidential historian Timothy Naftali, a professor at New York University, said the coronavirus crisis offered Trump "an opportunity that doesn't often come to presidents" not just to show growth but to show commanding leadership and to bring the country together.


  "He failed, because he's never been able to get beyond himself," Naftali said. "He shouldn't be wasting an ounce of energy on feuds. But it's Trump against the world all the time."


  Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., sought to nudge the president away from one possible scapegoat and toward a more obvious one, tweeting Monday, "#FireFauci? For what?" and noting that China, which Trump has already blamed for the pandemic, "did & continues to mislead own people & world."


  But some pushing the president to prioritize reopening the economy over public health concerns have been vocal about their frustration with Fauci.


  "I think its time ... for Dr. Fauci to move along," Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., told KFYI-AM on Monday. "I mean he shouldn't have a seat at the table."


  There is no evidence beyond Sunday's tweet that Trump is likely to dismiss or demote Fauci. The doctor's popularity as a trusted voice amid the crisis is hardly lost on the president, although the two have strenuously disagreed at times behind closed doors.


  Fauci's approval rating stood at 78% in a Quinnipiac University poll last week, 32 points higher than Trump's rating. On Friday, the president even joked that he's encouraged Fauci to run against Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. Both are from the Bronx.


  In any case, those urging Trump to fire Fauci overestimate the president's power.


  "He can't just fire him. He's a career employee," said Max Stier, president and chief executive of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that focuses on improving efficiency of the federal government.


  Fauci has held his job leading the infectious disease unit at the National Institutes of Health since 1984, serving presidents in both parties. His boss at NIH, Francis Collins, is a political appointee held over from the Obama administration. But even if Collins wanted to fire Fauci, it would legally have to be for cause.


  Civil service protections were created precisely to protect government employees from political retaliation.


  On Monday, the White House responded to inquiries about Fauci's status by criticizing the media, asserting that such questions were driven by an innate bias rather than a reaction to the president's Twitter feed.


  "This media chatter is ridiculous — President Trump is not firing Dr. Fauci," deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said in a statement. "Dr. Fauci has been and remains a trusted adviser to President Trump."

President Donald Trump said on Monday he liked leading health expert Anthony Fauci and did not intend to fire him after Fauci said in an interview that earlier mitigation efforts against the coronavirus outbreak could have saved more lives. At a sometimes contentious briefing with reporters, Trump said he and Fauci had been on the same page "from the beginning" about the virus and played a video for reporters defending his administration's response.
 Trump, who played down the seriousness of the virus in its initial stages, has chafed at media coverage suggesting he did not do enough to prevent its spread. On Sunday, Trump retweeted a call to fire Fauci after the top U.S. expert on infectious diseases said lives could have been saved if the country had shut down sooner during the novel coronavirus outbreak.
 At the briefing on Monday, Fauci said he was answering a hypothetical question in the interview and made clear that Trump had listened to him when he recommended mitigation efforts. "I like him," Trump said of Fauci. "I think he's a wonderful guy." Trump said he had been on the same page with Fauci from the beginning of the crisis, but added that not everyone was happy with the doctor.
 Fauci has assumed national prominence - and a degree of popular affection - as a leader in the fight against the coronavirus, which has killed 23,543 people in the United States and infected 583,990, according to a Reuters tally. He has contradicted or corrected Trump on scientific matters during the public health crisis, including whether the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine is effective against the virus.
 On Monday, Fauci made a point of saying the president had followed his advice on putting social distancing recommendations in place for the country. "The president listened to the recommendation," Fauci said. "The first and only time that I went in and said: 'We should do mitigation strongly,' the response was, 'Yes, we'll do it.'"
 'VERY COMPLICATED' The Republican president in the past has repeated critical tweets of officials or enemies rather than make the criticism himself. The retweet fueled speculation Trump was running out of patience with Fauci and could fire him, prompting a White House denial before Trump's briefing.
 White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said Trump's retweet addressed what he considered a false report on his travel restriction involving China, where the novel coronavirus originated. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was asked on CNN about a New York Times report documenting early warnings issued to the White House about the novel coronavirus. The scientist acknowledged shutting the country down sooner could have saved lives, but cautioned that a number of factors were involved.
 "Obviously, it would have been nice if we had a better head start, but I don't think you could say that we are where we are right now because of one factor," Fauci said. "It's very complicated." Already a target of the far right for his contradictions of Trump, Fauci drew more opprobrium after the interview.
 Trump also denounced the Times story in tweets on Sunday, calling it "Fake." Last week during the daily White House coronavirus briefing, Trump stepped in and prevented Fauci from answering a question about hydroxychloroquine.
 "He won't fire Fauci today," tweeted Joe Lockhart, press secretary to former President Bill Clinton, a Democrat. "That's not his style. He needs to humiliate him a while first." Fauci, 79, has led the federal infectious disease agency since 1984 under Republican and Democratic presidents. Republican George W. Bush honored him with the presidential Medal of Freedom in 2008.
 Some opinion polls during the public health crisis have shown Americans trust him more than Trump.

BATTLEFORDS, Sask. - A lineup of vehicles stretching several kilometres along a Saskatchewan highway greeted family members of Colby Cave on Monday, as they returned home from Toronto where the Edmonton Oilers forward died of a brain bleed.


  Bob Bartkewich, a longtime family friend who plays hockey with Cave's father, said he and others wanted a way to honour the family given current COVID-19 restrictions prevent them from getting together as a group.


  "I was one of the first guys to hold Colby," Bartkewich said Monday, taking a long pause.


  "He was a good kid."


  Cave, who hailed from Battleford, Sask., was placed in a medically-induced coma last week. He underwent emergency surgery with doctors removing a colloid cyst that was causing pressure on his brain.


  The Oilers confirmed the 25-year-old died on Saturday.


  To support the family, Bartkewich says he and other friends came up with the idea to form a line of vehicles along Highway 16 leading into Battleford that the family could see as they returned home.


  Bartkewich said the idea snowballed. About 500 signs displaying Cave's Oilers jersey with his number 12 on it were printed.


  Some people held the signs and others stood outside their vehicles wearing hockey jerseys as fire trucks led the family's vehicle down the road.

By Monday, the two leaders were still sending conflicting messages even as New York City sent out messages to students, families and teachers that distance learning will continue through June.
 To most observers, the inability of the mayor and governor to work as a team was a disappointment, though not a surprise.
 “I don’t think there’s any question that the schools will in fact stay closed for the rest of the school year, and both men know this,” said Aaron Pallas, a professor of sociology and education at Columbia University's Teachers College. “The bickering about when that decision gets made and who gets to make it is confusing and insulting to parents and educators who have to plan and live with this decision."
 Some were blunter.
 “I don’t have patience for petty back-and-forths in the middle of a deadly pandemic,” Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams tweeted Saturday. “Cut the crap.”
 The two leaders have skirmished frequently since de Blasio took office in 2014.
 When de Blasio sought to pay for his signature initiative of universal pre-K through a tax on wealthy New York City residents, the more moderate Cuomo blocked the wealth tax while agreeing to fund the program through the state budget process.

"It’s pretty easy, everybody bonds together. It’s more like a family situation, we aren’t just teammates.”“It’s just the bond that is different with the seniors," WFHS soccer senior Marco Barron said. "They took me in, they treated me well when I came in my junior year."It’s a bond that I’ll never forget.”For these seniors, there is still some hope that they will return to the field and get to compete for a chance at state.But if their time in the black and red is done, they will take away some valuable lessons.“It taught me what really working hard means and determination and how to go as far as you want," Dorman said.“It’s just persistence," Barron said.

Brendan Rodgers feels Celtic are in the best possible shape as they prepare for the start of their Champions League campaign against Lincoln Red Imps.


  Celtic travel to Gibraltar for the away leg of their Champions League second qualifying round tie on Tuesday, eight days before the return match in Glasgow.


  Rodgers' new side have played four pre-season matches in Slovenia and Austria, drawing 2-2 against Celje before 1-0 and 2-1 wins over Sturm Graz and Olimpija respectively.


  Celtic rounded off their preparation with a 0-0 draw away to Maribor on Saturday and the former Liverpool boss has been impressed with what he has seen given he has had just three weeks to get his squad ready.


  "It's been an excellent tour for us," said Rodgers. "It's only been 20 days since we have been together. I felt we left Lennoxtown, having worked well, and at the end of this 20-day period, we travel to our first European qualification game as a team.


  "I have been overly pleased by the attitude of the players. There is still a long way to go before we are perfect but in terms of the attitude and what the players are trying to take on board, I have been delighted.


  "It will be a tough game in Gibraltar but we are ready as we can be. We have piled as much work as we can into the last 20 days out here both on and off the pitch and we are ready as we can be for it.


  "In terms of what I saw over the four games, we have only conceded one goal from open play over games, so our defensive organisation and our pressing has become very good. We will get better offensively as time goes on and we work together."


  On the draw with Maribor, Rodgers added: "Maribor, for five of the last six years have been Slovenian champions so it was really good exercise for us and the players coped and adapted really well in what were very hot conditions and the preparation for the game on Tuesday was perfect.


  "They have qualified for the Champions League recently and ran Chelsea very close here. They are a good side and when they play at their own ground, they are very hard to beat. I thought our players were excellent."


  If Rodgers is to lead Celtic into the Champions League group stage for the first time in three years, the Lincoln tie will be the first of three that they must win.

Farmers are used to adversity. Along with trade conflicts, weak commodity prices and fluctuating weather, farmers must now consider the COVID-19 pandemic.


   


  "Life has changed as we know it. We're all trying to figure out what this is and how it will affect agriculture," said Robin Reid Kansas State University agricultural economist during an April 8 webinar. The event was one of two offered for women in agriculture.


   


  In many cases, one parent is either working from home or has an off-farm job to go to while the other parent is planting spring crops or tending livestock.

  According to Winsor, the pandemic is a "black swan" event - one that could not be predicted or planned for but could have catastrophic effects. The spread of COVID-19 and resulting stay-at-home orders, business closures and potential supply chain disruptions due to transportation or labor difficulties are presenting more uncertainty and anxiety.


   


  Dairy, beef cattle, hogs and corn have been hit the hardest, Reid said, adding that the corn market received a double whammy - the oil trade war between Russia and Saudi Arabia, which has driven oil and gasoline prices lower, plus less demand for ethanol because the pandemic-related stay-at-home orders means drivers are driving less.


   


  About one-third of ethanol plants are predicted to close, Reid said, which reduces the need for corn.


   


  Because of the predicted plant closures, an estimated 200 million to 500 million fewer bushels of corn will be needed this year compared with last.


   


  "USDA had projected a $3.60 Marketing Year Average for this year's corn crop," Reid said. "I don't believe that estimate will last because of the factors that are bringing corn prices down."


   


  U.S. grain sorghum prices, on the other hand, are strengthening because China is making purchases.


   


  Wheat are up because countries such as Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan are stockpiling wheat for domestic consumption.


   


  "As bread is flying off the shelves, we've seen more demand for wheat. That's really the biggest boost," Reid said.


   


  Agricultural processors cannot always change quickly, which adds uncertainty to farmers deciding what crops to grow or how much milk or meat to produce.


   


  "I can't emphasize this enough -- continue to look at your farm financials," Winsor said. "None of us feel very secure right now. Stay the course, and follow your plan, but make adjustments if needed."

The success of _Tiger King_ has led the makers of the docuseries to produce a new episode that will add to its popularity. Joe Exotic was recently diagnosed with Covid-19 while in prison serving a 22-year sentence for animal cruetly and a murder plot to kill Carole Baskin. While this is often joked about, it is a prelude to a terrible spread of infection and death toll in this country’s mass incarceration system. While many workers in the marijuana industry are considered essential to help suffering patients, hundreds of thousands of people of color are warehoused in prisons for non-violent drug offenses. This tragedy is only one example of how issues brought up through people’s fascination with _Tiger King_ deserve deeper discussion.

Colleges are increasingly spending more to woo affluent students with scholarships based solely on academic or other achievements, experts say. And it's leaving those who need aid the most with fewer resources to afford college.


  Students in the highest 25% income range received a greater amount of non- federal financial aid ($11,300) on average compared with all other income levels, including those in the lowest 25% income range ($7,500), according to a 2019 report on non-federal aid by the National Center for Education Statistics.


  Here's why colleges are giving more aid to wealthier students and how students with financial need can maximize available options.


  COLLEGES WANT WEALTHIER STUDENTS


  Affluent students get more school aid compared with students with financial need because colleges are actively pursuing them, experts say. Schools are offering non-need-based merit aid in order to attract students with wealth, especially if they're high-performing.


  It's a race for prestige, says Martin Van Der Werf, associate director of editorial and postsecondary policy at the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce.


  "Better prepared students, higher graduation rates and a better chance of attracting students who will later give back to the college -- that's the reward system that's in place," says Van Der Werf, adding that there's no similar reward system for helping low-income students.


  Colleges tend to choose students who will boost their rankings, and rich students often have characteristics that fit the bill.


  Rankings are always partially based on performance metrics: U.S. News & World Report's annual rankings, for example, take into account academic success and high SAT scores. Wealthier students tend to perform better on SATs, according to an assessment of SAT results by the Brookings Institution.


  Another factor in rankings is college completion -- national data show students from low-income schools are slightly less likely to graduate compared with students at high-income schools.


  SCHOOLS ARE COMPETING


  In an effort to compete with one another, private and public colleges are adopting a "high tuition, high aid" model, says Stephen Burd, senior writer and editor of higher education at New America, a nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank.


  "It makes it more and more expensive for the people who don't get money, leaving them with more unmet need," Burd says.


  You expect to see a high price tag at private colleges, but now public colleges are getting in the game by raising costs and working to attract out- of-state students who pay more to attend.


  "It is derailing public higher education and why we have a public higher education system to begin with," he adds.


  FINANCIAL AID BUDGETS ARE LIMITED


  Families depend on financial aid to help meet college costs -- aid like scholarships and grants covers about one-third of college costs, according to Sallie Mae's most recent "How America Pays for College" report.


  But there's only so much money to go around when it comes to a college's financial aid budget, and schools must make choices about how that money is spent.


  From 2014 to 2017, non-need aid, or merit aid, among colleges grew 37%, compared with need-based aid, which grew 21%, according to a 2020 New America report that examines financial aid among 339 schools. These schools increased their non-need aid from $2.2 billion to nearly $3 billion over this time period.


  Some colleges are trying to give as much as they can to students, especially Pell Grant recipients, argues Robert Kelchen, associate professor of higher education at Seton Hall University in South Orange, New Jersey.


  But, he adds, that doesn't mean students will get the full amount of financial aid that they're qualified for -- colleges will give only what they budget for.


  HOW TO GET MORE AID FOR COLLEGE


  In lieu of sweeping change among all colleges to increase need-based aid, low-income students can still maximize financial aid that is available. Here's how.


  -- Since most aid is first come, first served, submit the FAFSA as close to the start date as possible (Oct. 1 each year). Complete the CSS Profile, too, if your college asks for it.


  -- Accept any Pell Grant money and work-study aid.


  -- Look for scholarships, some of which are need-based. Try the U.S. Department of Labor's Scholarships Search Tool.


  -- If you need a loan, borrow no more than 10% of projected after-tax monthly income in your first year out of school. Take out subsidized federal student loans first.


  -- Appeal to your college for more aid if your financial situation has changed since you filed the FAFSA.

Celtic are closing in on the signing of Aston Villa winger Scott Sinclair.


  Manager Brendan Rodgers strongly hinted that a move was close on Friday after the Championship side's manager, Roberto Di Matteo, confirmed a new bid had been made by the Scottish champions.


  Reports suggest the clubs have agreed a £3.5million deal and that Sinclair will be in Glasgow for a medical this weekend.


  Celtic are eager to make a signing before Sunday, which is the final day they can register players for their pivotal Champions League play-off tie against Hapoel Beer Sheva.


  Rodgers managed Sinclair, 27, for two seasons at Swansea City.


  "There's no smoke without fire and there's been a lot of smoke," said Rodgers.


  "Scott's a player I know well. I had him in at Chelsea when he was 16 years of age out of Bristol Rovers. I know him probably as well as anyone and I know his qualities.


  "I would really hope we could do something between now and the weekend that allows us to get at least one player in before the deadline."


  Villa boss Di Matteo said: "We've received an offer from Celtic and we're considering this offer.


  "Until there's anything clearer to report we can't say anything more. It's a fresh bid. We will have to see how the next 24 hours develop."


  Sinclair joined Villa from Manchester City on loan in January 2015, before the deal was later made permanent. He only scored three Premier League goals in 18 months at Villa Park.

New Inter boss Frank de Boer insists captain and star striker Mauro Icardi will not leave the club as he plots to end Juventus' dominance of Serie A.


  The former Netherlands international has signed a three-year deal at San Siro to succeed Roberto Mancini, who left his role amid reports of a dispute with club owners Suning Holdings Group.


  A succession of heavy pre-season defeats preceded Mancini's exit, with De Boer confirming the club approached him in the aftermath of last Friday's 6-1 defeat to Tottenham.


  But the 46-year-old was bullish over Inter's prospects at his first news conference as coach and he expects Icardi – a reported transfer target for Arsenal and Napoli over the course of the close-season – to play a key role in attempting to stop Juve adding a sixth consecutive league title this season.


  "I thank Inter for choosing me," De Boer said. "I spoke with the owners and everyone wants to bring the club where it deserves to be.


  "Juventus are not unbeatable, sometimes things change. They have a great team and it will be tough, but we want to fight.


  "We will keep the players who do not want to sell. Icardi will remain.


  "Mauro is young, can still learn and we will work very well together."


  Mancini's future was a source of speculation throughout a fractious pre- season and De Boer revealed that he held exploratory talks with Inter's owners two weeks ago.


  "We spoke to Inter two weeks ago simply to understand whether there might be any common ground," he explained.


  "Everything happened quickly. I was honoured by their interest."


  Inter's opening game of the Serie A season comes away at Chievo in 12 days' time, meaning De Boer faces a race against time to get his players up to speed.


  "It's not an ideal situation but we have a very talented and experienced side," the ex-Ajax coach added.


  "We can use our ideas to be ready in a short space of time. We have a philosophy and the team needs to believe in that.


  "I'm convinced that we'll be ready and that we'll get on the right track as quickly as possible."

The global outbreak of the new coronavirus has changed the way Americans conduct business, for the time being at the least.


  Limited public access, social distancing and workplace restrictions have engendered a period of adjustment the likes of which we haven't seen since the Great Depression and World War II.


  Still, the opportunities exist for many companies to adapt to the "new normal" and maintain a solid level of productivity. Enter teleworking - having employees shift their operations to a home office during this public health crisis.


  Businesses that have implemented the practice of teleworking for years now are ahead of things in terms of integration, protocol and security. For those businesses with a longstanding culture of working within a "traditional" office setting, the following is a brief playbook to help integrate teleworking into their overall strategy.


  Virtual Private Network--Teleworking begins with a Virtual Private Network, or VPN - a tool that connects remote users to a company's private internal network by using the internet for connectivity. With cloud-based technology, VPNs can be relatively simple for a company to establish, providing they have the capacity to make it work company-wide.


  While a VPN can provide access to company resources, it may not be enough to enable a "usable" end-user experience. Some legacy applications are not well optimized to run over a VPN and the lack of responsiveness can be frustrating to end-users. Fortunately, there are solutions called Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) that provide a remote desktop experience. A VDI reduces the amount of bandwidth being consumed, allows the application to run within the secure confines of the business network, and provides a more responsive experience for the end-user.


  Ensuring productivity--Once a VPN is established and employees can work from home, the business needs to develop a system of monitoring remote users to ensure productivity. Employees and employers can work together to determine what defines productivity and what level is expected while teleworking.


  Next, specify parameters for the home workspace; employers should stress the importance of an appropriate space and proper workplace etiquette. Make sure employees have the right tools--such as access to instant messaging and internal communication chains, headsets and hardware needed to operate properly.


  Security--Proper security is paramount for teleworking, given the persistent threat of cyber security attacks. Any changes to infrastructure to support remote work should include a review of the security approach to guard against an increase in potential exposure. All protocols followed by a company for on- site users--password protections, encryption, alertness to and notification of potential scams and more--must be in place in the home office as well. In fact, vigilance should be heightened as not all network traffic on the user's PC is necessarily protected by the corporate firewall.


  Telework has evolved into something much more than opening a laptop at the kitchen table; it should be viewed as a direct extension of the main office, with all compulsory rules and processes in place. During a time as extraordinary and uncertain as the one we presently find ourselves in, telework is a vital and valuable tool that can help businesses stay afloat, provide stability, and even grow.

Sanders, I-Vt., urged Americans to join him in supporting Biden "to make certain we defeat someone I believe is the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country."


  The two announced they were establishing several task forces made up of advisers from both camps to hash out policy agreements on issues such as the economy, education, criminal justice, immigration, health care and climate change.


  Sanders' endorsement ends any doubt that lingered in the wake of his announcement last week that he was abandoning his bid for the presidential nomination, in a speech that fell short of a full-throated endorsement of Biden.


  "Today, I am asking all Americans — I'm asking every Democrat, I'm asking every independent, I'm asking a lot of Republicans — to come together in this campaign to support your candidacy, which I endorse," Sanders said to Biden.


  Sanders' move came almost exactly three months earlier than in the far-more- acrimonious 2016 primary campaign, allowing more time for the party to rally for the general election battle.


  Aides said Biden and Sanders had always enjoyed a better personal relationship than Sanders did with Clinton. That sometimes made Sanders more reluctant to attack Biden during the primary campaign than some of his supporters would have liked, and, indeed, even in the aftermath of the endorsement some of Sanders' prominent backers declined to follow suit.


  Briahna Joy Gray, Sanders' campaign press secretary, for example, wrote on Twitter: "With the utmost respect for Bernie Sanders, who is an incredible human being & a genuine inspiration, I don't endorse Joe Biden.

  Senior advisers to Biden and Sanders have been meeting for weeks to find commonalities on policy and lay the groundwork for an endorsement.


  Biden, who has struggled to win support from the progressives and young voters who flocked to Sanders, expressed gratitude to the senator.

Investors have become increasingly spooked about the stability of Son’s empire and its $100 billion Vision Fund amid the virus outbreak. Shares tumbled at one point more than 50 percent from their peak this year, and SoftBank’s credit default swaps — the cost of insuring debt against default — spiked to their highest levels in about decade. SoftBank’s American depositary receipts were down about 6 percent during trading Monday.
 Son has also drawn unusual pressure from some investors. The U.S. activist investor Elliott Management Corp. took a substantial stake in the company, advocating for changes in governance and investing practices.
 The billionaire responded with a strategy to part with some of his precious holdings, unloading about $41 billion in assets to buy back shares and pay off debts. SoftBank plans to sell about $14 billion of shares in Chinese e-commerce leader Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. as part of an effort, Bloomberg News has reported.
 "This will only make asset sales even more urgent for SoftBank,” said Koji Hirai, the head of M&A at advisory firm Kachitas Corp. in Tokyo.
 It’s a dramatic turnaround for the 62-year-old Son. Just two months ago, he declared on stage in Tokyo that SoftBank’s fortunes were turning around after the WeWork meltdown.
 "After a difficult winter always comes spring,” Son said at the time.
 He highlighted a big surge in the shares of Uber Technologies Inc., one of SoftBank’s bigger holdings, explaining that his company would likely be able to book a profit on the stake. He also declared WeWork poised for a comeback.
 But the coronavirus outbreak wreaked havoc on those plans. With fear of contagion, people stopped sharing offices from Beijing to New York. Ride- hailing companies — SoftBank has stakes in four of the biggest worldwide — saw business evaporate. Dara Khosrowshahi, chief executive officer of Uber, publicly declared "I wouldn’t put my kids in an Uber.”
 Another sign of the troubles is Oyo, a hotel-booking service into which SoftBank invested about $1.5 billion. Its business model has been slammed as global travel screeched to a halt. This month, Ritesh Agarwal, founder and chief executive officer, said the company would furlough employees in countries outside India as it struggles to survive the virus.
 Complicating the situation is that Agarwal, 26, borrowed about $2 billion to buy more shares in his own company. Son personally guaranteed the loans, Bloomberg News has reported.
 SoftBank’s controversial accounting practices have aggravated the volatility of its earnings. The Vision Fund booked profits on startups as their valuations rose, even if the gains were only on paper and no shares were sold. WeWork and Oyo both contributed to profits early on in the fund’s lifetime.
 Now the Vision Fund, which Son has declared is the future of his company, is piling up losses as valuations are written down again. The fund has lost a cumulative ¥240 billion since SoftBank began breaking out its results, including the most recent quarter, according to Bloomberg calculations.
 SoftBank’s operating loss for the current fiscal year is the most ever for the company, which Son took public in 1994. Its projected net loss of ¥750 billion would also be a record and compares with a ¥1.41 trillion profit the year earlier.
 Sales for the fiscal year are expected to fall about 36 percent to ¥6.15 trillion after SoftBank removed U.S. unit Sprint Corp. from its balance sheet to account for its merger with T-Mobile US Inc.
 "The coronavirus was the final blow, but bad investments and misjudgments were the start,” said Hirai of Kachitas.

Kiper continued to rant during commercial break.
 As the draft moved on. More names came off the board — New Mexico linebacker Brian Urlacher to Chicago, Heisman Trophy-winning running back Ron Dayne of Wisconsin to the New York Giants, etc. Denver was a possibility at No. 15, but the Broncos went with California cornerback Deltha O’Neal. Kiper’s expression was one of disbelief. How could a team with Brian Griese and Gus Frerotte under center pass on Pennington, he wondered allowed during the break, before speculating that the 49ers, another team that had worked out Pennington considerably, would select the Herd star at 16.
 Instead, the 49ers picked Michigan State linebacker Julian Peterson, whom Oakland had been eyeing one pick later. The Raiders then went with Florida State kicker Sebastian Janikowski, putting the New York Jets on the clock and sending the Garden crowd into a frenzy. Jets fans chanted, “Penn-ing-ton! Penn-ing-ton!”
 New York had four picks in the first round and already had taken Tennessee defensive end Shaun Ellis and South Carolina linebacker John Abraham. Jets General Manager Bill Parcells said he had no intentional of draft a quarterback in the first round, but didn’t figure Pennington would be there at No. 18. Parcells couldn’t pass up the Herd standout, especially at a position where 37-year-old Vinny Testaverde was the starter. Parcells picked the Herd’s Heisman finalist and prompting simultaneous celebrations in the Garden, Marshall’s football office and the Pennington home in LaFollette, Tennessee.
 “Staying green,” Pennington told his dad. “We won’t have to change a thing.”
 Pennington said he figured either Pittsburgh or San Francisco would draft him, but had no idea what might happen after those teams passed.
 “It feels awesome, right now,” Pennington said after New York called his name. “I’m not disappointed [going 18th]. It just fuels my fire. I’m glad to go to a team that wants me. It feels great to be a New York Jet.”
 Beckett, a fabulous open-field tackler, went 43rd, shoring up a poor Chargers’ run defense. Oddly enough, San Diego didn’t have a first-round pick because it had traded it to Tampa Bay last season and the Buccaneers then dealt that choice to the Jets, who used it to select Pennington.
 “We talked about trading up in the first round, but we really felt we could address a need with Rogers Beckett,” Chargers coach Mike Riley said.
 The Vikings took Chapman at No. 88 and Seattle picked Williams at 175, giving the Herd four NFL draftees off its undefeated 1999 Motor City Bowl championship team. Several more players signed free agent contracts.

Like everyone else, West Virginia University basketball coach Bob Huggins can’t wait until he’s free to move about and work like he did before the coronavirus pandemic left the country mostly sequestered at home. Sunday night, he and his family caught seven straight episodes of “Naked and Afraid.” He’s conducted a couple of Zoom meetings with the whole team and the Mountaineer staff so the players could get some questions answered.
 Huggins would really like to see those players face to face sooner than later. He feels the team he has coming back – most of which played a big part in a 21-10 record and a No. 24 finish in the Associated Press poll – is primed for another strong run.
 One spot of uncertainty with the roster is with Oscar Tshiebwe, who emerged as one of the nation’s top freshmen and announced last week he would seek an NBA draft evaluation. Huggins said Monday he “fully expects” not to have to worry about roster upheaval, but added that Tshiebwe is heading into uncharted waters with how his draft evaluation process is going to play out.
 “I’ve never really had anybody go through what Oscar’s going to go through, because there’s really nothing to go through,” Huggins said during a Monday video conference.
 The NBA will not hold a draft combine, nor will teams invite prospects in for workouts. There also have been reports that the draft could be pushed to at least August. Without a combine or workouts, NBA teams are robbed of face-to- face interaction and evaluation.
 Huggins said that face time is as important with NBA draft research as it is with college recruiting. A coach or scout can see exactly how tall they are and exactly how quick they are around the court rather than trying to figure it out from a highlight reel.
 “I think the biggest thing is being able to watch them in real time rather than just watch them on screen,” Huggins said.
 What the pandemic will do to NBA teams and their draft strategies is something Huggins doesn’t know. It’s also something he doesn’t think a lot of NBA teams know, either. All these hurdles are unknowns for these teams and just how difficult it will make the process isn’t yet clear.
 “I don’t think there’s very many of them – and I know most of those guys – I don’t think there’s very many of them that want to make a multi-million dollar, multi-year deal from watching film,” Huggins said.
 Regardless, Huggins said he and the WVU staff will counsel Tshiebwe to make the right decision for him. He said Tshiebwe trusts and will listen to the coaches, as they won’t steer him down a wrong path.

Chelsea boss Antonio Conte explained the thinking behind Michy Batshuayi's surprise debut in Wednesday's 3-0 friendly win over Wolfsberger.


  Conte's reign began with a 2-0 defeat to Rapid Vienna at the weekend but a repeat rarely looked to be on the cards in the concluding match of their Austrian trip, with youngsters Bertrand Traore, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Nathaniel Chalobah all on target.


  Belgium international forward Batshuayi, a big-money acquisition from Marseille, was not officially named among Conte's substitutes but he emerged from the dugout to replace Diego Costa after 58 minutes.


  "He has trained three days and I wanted to see if after these three days he understood some tactical aspects," Conte said.


  "He can improve a lot, he can become a strong forward, he is very young but with great talent and I am happy with him."


  There is growing speculation that Batshuayi might not be the last attacking addition at Stamford Bridge this close-season, with reports that Real Madrid have rejected a €75million Chelsea approach for Alvaro Morata.


  Nevertheless, Conte refused to be drawn on the subject.


  "About this situation I prefer to leave it with the club," he told reporters.


  "We know our targets and the most important thing is that, between me and the club, there is a great synergy on the transfer market.


  "We know our targets and, for me, this is the most important thing. It’s not important to speak outside but, to keep the secret in this moment, I think is very important."


  In the meantime, Loftus-Cheek - generally deployed as a deep-lying midfielder during his fledgling career to date - has found himself playing further forward and won praise from his boss.


  "Every manager has their own idea about a system of play. In this system, with two midfielders, Ruben can play close to the other forward but become a forward when we have the ball," Conte added.


  "He has the right characteristics to play in this position and he showed that today."

"These cuts, especially relative to the inflated production figures over the last month, will not bring the market back into balance unless we see a dramatic "V-shaped" economic recovery in the coming weeks," FOREX.com said in a note.


  Inventories are expected to fill up fast even as some countries among the G20 agreed to buy oil for their national reserves.


  Still, U.S. production is falling in tandem with a drop in prices and there are signs the coronavirus outbreak may have peaked in some areas of the world.


  U.S. shale oil output is expected to have the biggest monthly drop on record during April, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (IEA) said on Monday.


  Production has been sliding for several months, but the declines are expected to accelerate sharply in April with a loss of nearly 200,000 bpd of production, the IEA said.


  That would bring shale oil output, which has been the driver of the sharp growth in U.S. production, to 8.7 million bpd.


  Numerous U.S. producers, including majors like Exxon Mobil and Chevron, have said they will cut spending and expect to produce less crude in the coming months.

Gasoline prices in Massachusetts are down five cents this week, according to AAA Northeast.      AAA Northeast's April 13 survey of prices in Massachusetts finds self-serve, regular unleaded averaging $1.94 per gallon. Massachusetts's price is eight cents above the national average of $1.86. A year ago at this time, the average price in Massachusetts was 67 cents higher at $2.61 per gallon.      "We are seeing fast and furious gasoline demand destruction. The latest data reveals demand levels not seen since spring of 1968. Every U.S. region is seeing builds in gasoline inventories and crude storage, which is just driving pump prices even cheaper," said Mary Maguire, Director, Public and Legislative Affairs.      On Sunday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plus (OPEC+), led by Saudi Arabia, announced historic global crude productions cuts - nearly 10 million barrels per day in May and June.      "While the production cut is historic, it's likely to not have an immediate impact on pump prices given the ongoing impact the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have on crude oil prices and gasoline demand," added Ms. Maguire.      The range in prices in the latest AAA survey for unleaded regular is $1.15, from a low of $1.44 to a high of $2.59. AAA advises motorists to shop around for the best prices in their area. Please remember to slow down and move over for any emergency vehicles on the side of the road.      This week's local gas prices and their ranges are as follows:      Self Serve Grade      $1.94 ($1.44-$2.59) Regular Unleaded      $2.34 ($1.89-$2.82) Midgrade Unleaded      $2.55 ($2.09-$2.99) Premium Unleaded      $2.69 ($2.43-$3.29) Diesel      Find the most up-to-date local gas prices with the AAA Fuel Finder by logging onto AAA.com and clicking on Gas Saving Tips & Tools.

Former Real Madrid coach Rafael Benitez claimed external problems derailed his tenure, insisting he had a good relationship with the players.
 Benitez was sacked as coach in January amid strong reports of dressing room unrest, just seven months into a three-year deal in Madrid.
 His replacement, Zinedine Zidane, went on to guide Madrid to Champions League glory as well as a second-place finish in La Liga in 2015-16.
 Benitez has since moved on to Newcastle United - now playing in England's Championship - but reflecting on his spell in the Spanish capital, the 56-year-old said everything was working well internally at the Santiago Bernabeu, contrary to reports, with Cristiano Ronaldo, Pepe and Sergio Ramos among the players at odds with the former boss.
 "It was a little strange. At first I was expecting to take a job in the Premier League, but then Madrid came calling," Benitez told Fox Sports Italy. "It was the fourth time that they had approached me – the team of my city, of my life, and it was time to say yes.
 "I arrived at a great club and there everything has to be perfect, but I think we did a good job. It's not always possible to control everything that's going on around the team.
 "The president wanted to do well in La Liga, clearly that was his priority, and to do that you need to have a side beyond just big names, where quality players really make a difference. That's my way of working. That was my idea, but then things weren't going so well, and for me they weren't going well at more of an external level than internal level, because the team was working well.
 "We were two points off Barcelona and we'd qualified from our Champions League group. I'll repeat it, it was more of an external thing than internal."
 On the relationship with the Madrid players, Benitez added: "Our relationship was good. In a team there are those who play a lot and others who don't, but clearly my relationship with the majority was perfect as they are very professional people.
 "When you bring in a new coach, things change, but I think the positive thing was that I had to go there and I did. I wanted to create a group capable of winning the league, but in the end I wasn't able to. You have to look forward, and now I have an exciting project at Newcastle in front of me."

His wife, Jennifer Auger, says her husband started developing symptoms on March 13 and was diagnosed on March 16. He was hospitalized shortly after and died March 30.


  She says he was particularly affected because by the disease he was asthmatic.


  "He was also a big guy, like a teddy bear," she says.


  Shawn Auger was involved in youth hockey and worked at the Youth Assessment Centre in High Prairie, Alta., about 370 kilometres northwest of Edmonton. His wife says a position was created especially for him to help youth transition out of the facility.


  "That job, he loved it," she said. "He loved it because he got to meet new people, talk to the youth and mean something to them."


  She says her husband first went to school to become a police officer and served in various placements, including at the Edmonton Institution, before he decided to work with young people.


  "He wanted to work with the youth ... to make a difference, so they didn't end up in jail or anything like that."


  She says she and her husband recently bought a house in the High Prairie area to renovate and turn into a group home.


  It's something she plans to continue in his memory.


  "Through all this, we did not lose Shawn," she says. "We gained a fighting, caring, wonderful angel ... and he is still working from beyond."

  Alice Grove


  NORTH BATTLEFORD, Sask. — Alice Grove was a 75-year-old widow who lived alone on a farm in west-central Saskatchewan.


  Her sister Eleanor Widdowson says Grove, a former nurse's aide at Saskatchewan Hospital, was having breathing difficulties and collapsed in her home on March 28. She died in hospital the next day.


  The sisters last saw each other on March 13 when they met for coffee in nearby North Battleford.


  Widdowson believes her sister contracted the virus on one of her many trips into the city.


  "We had warned her and warned her and warned her to stay at home," Widdowson told Saskatoon radio station CKOM. "But she'd get lonely. Anyone would, living out on a farm by themselves."


  Grove's battle with COVID-19 was hampered by diabetes, says Widdowson. Grove had also survived a battle with cancer.


  Ultimately, Widdowson says she made the decision to remove Grove from life support.


  "You have to be sensible about it and not take treatment away from a possible 35-year-old that can get better, when you know the 75-year-old lady's not going to get better."

  Vincent was 64 when he died on March 22 after attending the Pacific Dental Conference, which drew about 15,000 people.


  Family lawyer Bettyanne Brownlee says Vincent was diligent in adhering to recommended practices for infection control throughout his more than 40-year career. He was quarantining himself when he died.


  She says Vincent cared deeply about people, had a great sense of humour, and his two great loves were skiing and sailing with friends and family.


  "He was enormously proud of his sons, who will keep their memories close as they come to terms with the absence of their father from their adult lives," Brownlee says.

  Mariette Tremblay


  MONTREAL — Mariette Tremblay's granddaughter says her 82-year-old grandmother was a caring woman who was loved by all.


  In the Facebook post, Bibianne Lavallee says her grandmother had suffered from respiratory problems and, when the virus struck, she was vulnerable. Her death was reported by Quebec health authorities on March 18.


  Lavallee says Tremblay took ill before Quebec began taking exceptional measures to combat the spread of the virus.


  "Unfortunately, by the time all of the measures were announced and taken, it was too late to spare my grandmother," Lavallee says. "When her diagnosis was announced, she was already doomed."


  Lavallee urges people to follow recommendations of public health officials.


  "We didn't have a chance to save Grandma. But you have the chance to make a difference now that we know; now that we know the damage caused by this pandemic," she says.


  "Everything must be done to prevent human tragedies like the one we are experiencing from continuing to multiply. We want the death of my grandmother, the first victim in Quebec of COVID-19, to help save lives."


  This report by The Canadian Press was first published April 9, 2020.

Gov. Brian Kemp said Monday he is “ready for” the day when Georgia’s economy can be fully restarted without restrictions. But he added that his administration right now is focusing its efforts on continuing to ramp up the state’s coronavirus testing capacity and preparing for an anticipated surge in COVID-19 patients as the projected statewide peak inches closer.


  Georgia remains under a mandatory shelter-in-place order through April 30, which aligns with the Trump administration’s current “stop the spread” guidelines, even as President Trump has spoken about “reopening” the country as early as next month.


  “I think a lot of people are thinking about that,” Kemp said when asked about the state’s plans for easing restrictions in comparison to other states during a press conference at the state Capitol. “I would tell people right now our focus is on surge capacity and our ability to test more people. I think we’re going to need that when we go back to work. When you look at other states, we’re a little behind the curve for when our peak is going to be. We need to focus on the mission at hand.”

Incumbent Lori Bica, board vice president, has received 11,336 votes, and incumbent Phil Lyons has received 9,528 votes of the reporting precincts.


  Bica, who has served on the board since 2017, is a UW-Eau Claire psychology professor.


  Lyons, UW-Stout’s chief business officer, was appointed to the board in December.


  As of early Monday night, write-in candidates have received 2,090 votes.


  Eau Claire County has not yet reported vote tallies for individual write-in candidates.


  With three school board seats open, one write-in is expected to win a seat.


  Three people are registered write-in candidates: Altoona city planner Joshua Clements, Regis High School student Eric Fisher and Eau Claire software engineer Justin Hendrickson.


  As registered write-ins, Clements, Fisher and Hendrickson have notified the district of their intent to run. Their names were not on the ballots, but election workers will be able to recognize their names on ballots, even if the name was slightly misspelled.


  Two of the three open board seats are standard three-year terms. The third open seat, created when former member Joe Luginbill resigned in 2019, is for one year, and will be filled by the candidate who gets the third highest number of votes.


  The Eau Claire school district also covers small parts of Chippewa and Dunn counties. Bica and Lyons are also leading in partial results reported from those counties.


  Among the registered write-ins, Fisher is leading in both outlying counties so far with 13 votes (as of Monday evening, Dunn County is reporting full results and Chippewa County only partial results). Clements and Hendrickson are both at 5 votes between Chippewa and Dunn counties.

Antonio Candreva has asked to leave Lazio, the club's sporting director Igli Tare has revealed, with the Italy international's agent indicating a move to Napoli may be imminent.
 The midfielder, who can also operate as a wing-back, is discussing terms with last season's Serie A runners-up after returning from Euro 2016 duty, agent Federico Pastorello said.
 Tare announced Candreva has requested a transfer from the Stadio Olimpico, with a new signing already lined up by the club.
 "With regards to Candreva, he has asked to leave and we've already secured a replacement if he does go," he told reporters.      Inter and Chelsea were among the other clubs interested in signing Candreva, who scored 10 goals in 30 league games last season, but Napoli are in pole position.
 New Lazio coach Simone Inzaghi, who was appointed after Marcelo Bielsa reneged on a deal to join the club, confirmed Candreva wants to leave.
 "He had seven good games with me, but then there are other needs," Inzaghi said.
