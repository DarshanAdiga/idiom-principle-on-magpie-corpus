This weekend has made it clear, once and for all, that US politicians who complain of mistreatment by the press, of unfair questions, and of antagonistic inquisitors who apparently lack some requisite display of fealty truly don’t understand how good they have it. Indeed, they should count themselves lucky that they’ll most likely never be held to account by the likes of Tova O’Brien, the political editor of New Zealand’s Newshub news service who went viral over the weekend thanks to her four-minute, on-air interview with a defeated political candidate who she hit, and hit hard, over the COVID-19 misinformation and untruths he spread during the campaign.

The solar-orbiting asteroid, which swings by Earth every six years, could take aim at us late in the next century. NASA puts the odds of an impact at 1-in-2,700. The more scientists know about potentially menacing asteroids like Bennu, the safer Earth will be.
 When Osiris-Rex blasted off in 2016 on the more than $800 million mission, scientists envisioned sandy stretches at Bennu. So the spacecraft was designed to ingest small pebbles less than an inch (2 centimeters) across.
 Scientists were stunned to find massive rocks and chunky gravel all over the place when the spacecraft arrived in 2018. And pebbles were occasionally seen shooting off the asteroid, falling back and sometimes ricocheting off again in a cosmic game of ping-pong.
 With so much rough terrain, engineers scrambled to aim for a tighter spot than originally anticipated. Nightingale Crater, the prime target, appears to have the biggest abundance of fine grains, but boulders still abound, including one dubbed Mount Doom.
 Then COVID-19 struck.
 The team fell behind and bumped the second and final touch-and-go dress rehearsal for the spacecraft to August. That pushed the sample grab to October.
 "Returning a sample is hard," said NASA's science mission chief, Thomas Zurbuchen. "The COVID made it even harder."
 Osiris-Rex has three bottles of nitrogen gas, which means it can touch down three times — no more.
 The spacecraft automatically will back away if it encounters unexpected hazards like big rocks that could cause it to tip over. And there's a chance it will touch down safely, but fail to collect enough rubble.
 In either case, the spacecraft would return to orbit around Bennu and try again in January at another location.
 With the first try finally here, Lauretta is worried, nervous, excited "and confident we have done everything possible to ensure a safe sampling."

STOW -- Fresh fish, healthy grain bowls, breakfast sandwiches and beer and wine are just some of what will be on the menu at Nan's Rustic Kitchen + Market, opening next month on Great Road.
 Owned by 29 Culinary LLC, Nan's will be run by chef Jordan Mackey, who also runs 29 Rustic on Hudson Road in Sudbury.
 When the pandemic struck earlier this year, Mackey said it was known that changes would have to be made to the 275-seat Sudbury restaurant, which has two bars and event space for 150 people. Owners pivoted to takeout service and began to plan for the future.
 "We needed to look far down the road and plan for what it was going to be like for our company and our team," Mackey said. "We have these resources for government funding, so we had to plan what we were going to do, because waiting for this to get better sounds like a really poor idea."
 The group began looking for a place where its vision of a curbside restaurant with a small amount of retail could become a reality. When they found the property at 271 Great Road (Rte. 62) in Stow, they knew they had hit the jackpot.
 Nan's, named for Mackey's wife Reanna (her childhood nickname was Nan), will feature healthy, prepared, family-style meals and side dishes, available for takeout, and limited chef-curated pantry essentials with local products.
 The eatery will also sell breakfast sandwiches and muffins, and salads and sandwiches for the lunch crowd. For dinner, it will concentrate on family- style dishes -- vegetables, grains, potato dishes and chicken, beef or pork dishes. Smoothies will be sold from "what I understand is the only espresso machine in the town of Stow," Mackey said. Fried chicken will also likely be on the menu.
 For Thanksgiving, he will offer pre-cooked side dishes and fresh turkeys.
 Mackey also has other plans for the space, although he admits they will take some time to implement.
 He hopes to offer digital cooking classes, a wine club and a virtual fish market. He plans to grow some of his own food on the 2 ½-acre property and hopes to begin raising chickens, primarily as pets.
 "We want to have chickens to be able to show people how to raise chickens on their property and show ourselves how to do it," Mackey said.
 Mackey envisions opening a virtual fish market, making the freshest fish possible available to his customers. The idea is that people will purchase the fish online, then pick it up from Nan's a few days later, fresh off the boat as it were.
 "Our partners go shopping at the docks every single day, so we can offer the entire Boston seafood harbor to residents because they will tell us what they want before we (bring) it in," he said.
 The space in the barn will be used to sell craft beer and organically grown wine. For customers who prefer to purchase in bulk during the pandemic, Mackey will offer wine by the case.
 Next summer, he hopes to offer farm-to-table wine dinners outside in the garden.
 "Chefs want to cook great 'cheffy' food," he said.
 Part of the plan is to create a gardening and teaching space.
 "Everyone has this fundamental instinct to return to growing food," Mackey said. "I'm seeing more gardens in people's yards than ever before."
 He wants to get students who might not otherwise have an opportunity to garden "dig(ging) in the dirt." He is hoping to partner with local farms to form a nonprofit to help finance the gardening project.
 He knows it will take time for all of his ideas to come to fruition.
 "I think there's more we can do with the space that is centered around our mission and our food concept," Mackey said. "It sounds like a utopian fantasy for today, and it is, and if I can pull it all off, it will be amazing. But if I can pull off 50% of it, it will still be amazing."
 Mackey and his family recently moved from Boxborough to Stow, where they plan to live near Nan's Rustic Kitchen and Market.

Through Catherine, _Spanish Princess_ creators Emma Frost and Matthew Graham could explore a woman who straddled multiple identities--all of which come to the forefront during the Battle of Flodden in the show, and in real life.
 The Battle of Flodden occurred while Henry VIII was off invading France--and reportedly _because_ Henry VIII was off invading France. In declaring war on England, King James IV of Scotland acted in accordance to a treaty with France, designed to protect the other from England's advances. Breaking a peace treaty signed with England in 1502, James IV of Scotland traveled south to the English border with an army of 30,000 men.  
 What ensued was the largest battle between England and Scotland in terms of troop numbers, and one of the bloodiest battles ever fought on English soil, according to the Guardian. The Battle of Flodden was especially devastating for Scotland, which lost much of its nobility--as well as King James IV himself, marking the last time a British king died in battle. The English army lost around 1,500 men, whereas the Scottish army up to 17,000, according to the Scotsman.

Her comment that alluded to "trust the dog" when the husky was running through snow being fired upon was hilarious since those of us that have seen the movie probably didn't even trust the dog when we first watched it. A lone dog running through the snow being chased by a helicopter and being shot at and having bombs dropped all around it should be a huge red flag to anyone, even a dog lover, ESPECIALLY when it's a horror movie, that something just isn't right. Then there's the way the dog is acting. Some might chalk it up to stress and the shock of being chased, but then of course the big reveal comes that the Americans have just let something insanely deadly into their midst and it's something that can change its shape and kill pretty much anything it touches. How many people in real life would react with "Hell no, time to bail" instead of trying to figure out who they could trust and who they couldn't? On top of that, it's likely that in this day and age things might be handled very differently if a spaceship was discovered, along with something that looked like a melted wax dummy with several extra appendages.

Parents who are completely unfamiliar with video games may be tempted to completely ban their children from playing. However, Kaspersky found that banning is not the healthiest solution. This is because children may have peers that play games at school and by disallowing them from participating, they may feel like an outcast.

Armenia’s foreign ministry said Baku’s rejection of ICRC mediation “attests to the fact that the Aliyev clan, which has turned itself into an instrument of Turkish expansionism in the region, is concerned only about holding its grip on power and while being terrified of the inevitable perspective of being accountable before its own people for unleashing a war and for the numerous lives it has claimed, tries to postpone the unavoidable moment of truth.”

Every 13 minutes, a woman dies of breast cancer. Where is the outrage?
 My name is Lisa Ann Wheeler. I am the field coordinator and lead breast cancer advocate in the State of South Carolina for the National Breast Cancer Coalition. NBCC’s mission is to end breast cancer. Founded in 1991, the NBCC is a collaboration of activists, survivors, researchers, policymakers, grassroots groups and national organizations who are racing against the clock to end breast cancer. We link hundreds of organizations and tens of thousands of individuals from across the country into a dynamic, diverse coalition that gives breast cancer a meaningful voice in Washington, D.C., and state capitals; in laboratories and health care institutions; and in local communities everywhere.
 Every 13 minutes a woman dies of breast cancer. Today, 110 women will die in the United States, and by year-end that number will reach 42,000. Worldwide that number is nearly 627,000. And each year, 520 men die of breast cancer in the United States. These numbers represent our family members, friends and loved ones.
 Ninety percent of breast cancer deaths are a direct result of metastatic disease. Metastatic breast cancer (MBC or Stage IV) is not a specific type of breast cancer but rather the most advanced stage. Thirty percent of those diagnosed with early stage breast cancer will go on to be diagnosed with MBC, that is one in three early stage survivors will become terminal. Many people do not realize that breast cancer itself does not become deadly until it spreads to other parts of the body, most often the lungs, brain, liver and bones. Breast cancer that spreads to other organs is still breast cancer and does not become bone cancer or liver cancer or lung cancer. Under a microscope, the tumor cells will still look and act like breast cancer and will be treated as breast cancer.
 Metastatic breast cancer is treatable but no longer curable. Treatment is lifelong and focuses on preventing further spread of the disease and managing symptoms. The goal is for patients to live a good quality of life for as long as possible. We need to change the breast cancer conversation to include MBC. Of the 3.5 million U.S. people living with a history of breast cancer (all stages), an estimated 155,000 have Stage IV breast cancer. This means when the average person thinks about breast cancer they are not thinking about people with MBC. They are thinking about family and friends who had early-stage disease, were treated and, to their knowledge, are fine. This is certainly understandable – but an ongoing challenge and one that must be addressed to make any meaningful progress in terms of education, awareness and scientific progress, especially research, which is paramount to ending MBC. Early detection does not guarantee a lifetime cure and treating early-stage breast cancer does not mean the person will never have breast cancer again. MBC can occur five, 10 or 15 or more years after a person’s original diagnosis and successful treatment.
 NBCC has initiated the Metastatic Breast Cancer Access to Care Act (H.R. 2178 in the Congress, S. 1374 in the Senate) and it remains one of our highest legislative priorities in 2020. This legislation will waive the 24-month waiting period for Medicare eligibility and the five-month waiting period for Social Security Disability Insurance benefits for individuals with MBC. The life expectancy for those diagnosed with MBC is three years, with the onerous waiting periods for Medicare and SSDI, men and women with MBC are just not living long enough to receive treatments that may give them more time with their loved ones, pain management and end of life support that they so truly deserve. This important legislation would provide individuals with MBC who already qualify for SSDI immediate access to their benefits. Waiting periods were put into place to address conditions that could reverse or improve, resulting in the individual no longer being deemed to have a disability. In the case of MBC, there is no reversal or cure. This legislation must be enacted as soon as possible.
 The bill currently has 176 Congressional co-sponsors and 22 Senatorial co- sponsors, including our incredibly supportive S.C. Reps. Joe Wilson, Joe Cunningham and Ralph Norman.
 I am working with our other elected S.C. officials, Reps. Jeff Duncan, William Timmons, James Clyburn and Tom Rice, and Sens. Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, to garner their blessing and support for this legislation. It is imperative that they join their colleagues in support of those living with MBC.
 We need our representatives in Washington to be accountable to the breast cancer community by supporting appropriate legislation.
 For nearly 30 years, NBCC has worked tirelessly to identify and eliminate the barriers to ending breast cancer. Our unwavering courage to take on the tough battles and the tenacity to keep moving forward until we win has made NBCC the strong organization that it is.
 Our accomplishments have been great, but we have a way to go before we reach our mission. Isn’t it time to stop the clock once and for all?

“Our No. 38 Speedy Cash Ford Mustang was ‘speedy fast’ today. We fired off pretty decent and made a couple of slight adjustments throughout the day to get us to an even better place. We picked up some damage at the end of Stage 2, but my guys on pit road did a great job and we were able to overcome and stay competitive for the rest of the race. We never gave up and managed to come away with a top-20 finish. I’m really proud of my Front Row Motorsports team and so thankful for the effort these guys put in each and every week. A huge thanks to our partners at Speedy Cash for coming on board with us this weekend for their final primary race of the year. Hope we can see them again soon.”

So what’s with the listing of random geographic locations? Was Atlas trying to sing the song “Dancing in the Street”? Well, perhaps Atlas was claiming that Covid-19 coronavirus cases were still increasing in places that had mandates to wear face masks. Such a claim would be grossly oversimplifying the situation. Associations don’t prove cause and effect. Face masks alone won’t be enough to stop the spread of the Covid-19 coronavirus. That would be like saying that wearing a tiara alone will make you a prom queen. You’ve got to wear other things too. And be on the ballot. And be voted as prom queen. Similarly, while face mask use can help when other interventions are concurrently in place, it won’t be able to overcome the lack of other interventions such as inadequate social distancing.

It does feel a little unfair since this young woman's reactions are kind of comical since she doesn't know what's coming, and her expressions are just too much since she's seeing this for the first time. If you get a good laugh at this video you should go and see what else she covers, such as The Princess Bride, Blazing Saddles, and many others that helped to make movies what they are today. These types of reactions are better than the movie in some instances since those of us that have been there, done that with these movies can't help but wonder if we were the same way when we were watching them for the first time. Some would say yes, of course we were, while others might say of course we weren't. But the truth is that it's very likely that we were as creeped out by this movie as anyone since it managed to get pretty gory at some points and didn't spare our sensibilities when it came to getting weird. But some older movies did have a few moments when they were fairly disturbing since they were a lot more lenient when it came to certain subjects that are considered a bit too much for certain sensibilities these days. For instance, Blazing Saddles, a parody that was poking at racism and other issues without cease, has greatly offended some people today, even though it was made by one of the only men in the industry that could possibly get away with such a thing, Mel Brooks. The Thing didn't really feature much in the way of offensive material, but it is likely that it would still be viewed by many that have never seen it in a way that would be described as comical.

ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) — Sean McDermott’s professional coaching world came crashing down around him upon being fired by Andy Reid in Philadelphia following the 2010 season.
 Already having difficulty coming to grips with being dismissed from his hometown dream job, and by his mentor, no less, McDermott couldn’t believe his ears when Reid suggested the setback would be beneficial in the long run for the then-36-year-old Eagles defensive coordinator.
 “Oh, it crushed me early on,” McDermott would say in 2017, after landing his first head coaching job with the Buffalo Bills. “It crushed me from the standpoint of, I looked introspectively, just looked at myself and said, ‘What did I do wrong?’”
