The Zuma men also discussed the death of Vusi Nhlakanipho, the former president's son who died at the age of 25. He died at Milpark Hospital in 2005 after suffering complications of systematic lupus erythematosus.
 During the broadcast, former president Zuma alleges that Nhlakanipho became collateral damage after his enemies failed to get to him.
 "Now that I know what took him, it's what pains me even more. I now know that it was people who were trying to kill me or to reach me, but who were finding it difficult and who then took a decision to create something that would pain me. It was a failure to take your life (Duduzane) that they went to the young men," Zuma said, adding that he believed his son was killed when his enemies tampered with his treatment.
