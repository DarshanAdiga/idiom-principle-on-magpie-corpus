The short also hopes to expose the unusual standards set by society for newly-wed brides. "We create a flawless imagery of women; we need to start depicting more authentic portrayals.

Additionally, there is a rising demand for clean, sustainable and eco-friendly energy generation due to increased concerns pertaining to rise in CO2 emissions from energy generation.

KAPALUA, Hawaii (AP) — J.B. Holmes played only two rounds in four months leading into the new year. He expected some rust at Kapalua, and it showed when he managed only two birdies in his opening round of 78. He can recover from that, especially in a 34-man field with no cut in the Sentry Tournament of Champions. Far more difficult was getting over his shot to win a major. For two days at Royal Portrush, Holmes played some of his best golf and shared the 36-hole lead. Even after Shane Lowry began to pull away with a 63 in the third round, Holmes still had a chance. Right up until he shot 87 on Sunday. “The British was great until the last day,” Holmes said when he arrived at Kapalua on the weekend. “That was fun being able to play like that, and then having one of those days with crazy, crazy weather. I hit one or two bad shots, and it starts compounding. Unfortunately, it happens.” The next two months were a blur. He finished near the bottom in two limited-field events with no cut. He was never in the mix at FedEx Cup playoffs opener. He played at Greenbrier to start a new season and missed the cut. And then a shoulder injury caused him to withdraw from the CJ Cup in South Korea, ending his year. For someone who won at Riviera in the Genesis Open early in the season, it suddenly felt like a bad year. “I shouldn't take it that way,” he said. “But it was just being so disappointed after playing great the whole week. You try not to think of it that way, but you come off as a negative. I played three great rounds and then just had a terrible day. For the rest of the year, that hurt a little bit.” He took a month off after his PGA Tour season ended because he felt he needed time away from the game. “I had been working hard all year,” he said. “I...

 He said: “The Office for National Statistics said retail sales fell by 0.6 per cent in November versus the previous month, although those figures don’t include Black Friday sales.
 “That suggests shoppers were delaying their Christmas shopping until closer to the big day.
 “More recently, Springboard said footfall had slumped in the morning of Boxing Day, suggesting that rain, a structural shift to online shopping and increased Black Friday spending were potentially to blame.
 “The perfect situation for retailers would be selling high volumes of goods over the Christmas season at full price. In reality what we might get is subdued volumes at cut price, which is the not the recipe for a healthy business.
 “Even online operators may have struggled. While orders increasingly shift online, it is clear that running web-based operations is not straightforward.
 “Significant investment still needs to go into warehousing, IT systems and marketing.
 “That means companies need to be making good profits so as to be able to afford ongoing investment in their business to keep them competitive.
 “Shares in many UK retailers have enjoyed a rebound since the General Election vote result in December, hitching a ride along with many other sectors as investors regain confidence in UK stocks.

CAIRO (AP) — Sudan's military says one of its aircraft has crashed in the western Darfour region on Thursday evening, killing all 16 people on board. The military says several officers were among those killed when the plane went down in the restless region of West Darfour, which has recently witnessed deadly ethnic clashes. The plane, a Russian Antonov An-12, crashed five minutes after taking off from the airport in the town of Genena. That's according to an army spokesman, Brig. Gen. Amer Mohammed al-Hassan who posted a statement late Thursday on the official Facebook page of the Sudan's armed forces. An investigation is underway to determine the cause of the crash. there were no immediate reports of foul play. Al-Hassan said the casualties included seven troops, three judges and six civilians, including two children. The town of Genena has recently witnessed clashes between Arabs and non-Arabs that killed at least three dozen people, including women and children, according to a health official and a local aid group who spoke to the Associated Press earlier this week. On Thursday, the Red Crescent said that the casualty toll had jumped to 48 killed and 167 wounded in the violence. The clashes pose a challenge to efforts by Sudan's transitional government to end decades-long rebellions in areas like Darfur. In response rebel groups from Darfur pulled out of peace talks with the government and called for an investigation. Earlier this week, Sudanese Prime Minister Hamdok and Gen. Mohammeed Hamdan Dagalo, deputy head of the Sovereign Council, had visited the town and expressed their commitment to prosecute the perpetrators.

The House majority has known this all along, but apparently they believe an impeachment will help them in the 2020 elections. I’m not so sure that is the case.

COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Sri Lanka's new president on Friday endorsed amending the constitution to reduce the power of minority political parties, saying the country wasn't suited to a system that creates unstable governments “constantly under the influence of extremism.” In a policy speech after he presided over the opening of a new Parliament session, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa said a majority of the voters who elected him in last November's presidential election rejected “political agendas founded on race” and proved “it is no longer possible for anyone to manipulate and control the politics of this country by playing the role of kingmaker. “Even though elections can be won through numbers, an unstable Parliament that cannot take clear decisions and remains constantly under the influence of extremism is not one that suits the country.” Voting patterns during the election showed a clear divide between Sri Lanka's majority Buddhist Sinhalese and minority Tamils and Muslims.
