SENECA FALLS — In a private ceremony kept simple due to COVID-19 restrictions, Frances “Fran” Barbieri was presented the 17th annual George Bailey Award recently.
 The full ceremony was videotaped and will be shown at 11 a.m. Saturday during the “It’s A Wonderful Life” virtual festival. Visit the It’s A Wonderful Life Museum website to view the presentation, to see a detailed program for the Festival, and to find information on free registration.
 Barbieri, who works at the Seneca Falls Historical Society and is the Seneca Falls historian, was honored for a long history of promoting and helping her hometown, just as George Bailey did in the 1946 Frank Capra film. Many feel the movie’s fictional community of Bedford Falls was based on Seneca Falls.
 “You spent your entire life helping this community in so many ways, very often behind the scenes, and isn’t that what George Bailey did?” said the first George Bailey Award recipient, Bob McKeveny, who presented Barbieri with the award in a surprise ceremony with her sisters, Pat and Deb, present; Deb won the award in 2015.
 “I’ve known you for more than 50 years. No one’s life emulates George Bailey more than you,” said 2018 George Bailey Award recipient Fred Capozzi. “You do so much for the quality of life of our community.”
 Barbieri received messages from former state Sen. Mike Nozzolio, a Seneca Falls native, and Karolyn Grimes, the actor who played Zuzu Bailey in the movie and who visits Seneca Falls every year for the It’s A Wonderful Life Festival.
 “Fran has touched everyone’s life. She’s touched my life,” Grimes said. “She is an angel in real life. Thanks Fran for being who you are.”
 “Through your lifetime, you’ve made our hometown of Seneca Falls a better place,” Nozzolio said.
 In accepting the award, Barbieri commented on the importance of the message in the movie.
 “You need something for your soul, and this movie takes care of your soul,” Barbieri said.
 The George Bailey Award was created in 2004 by the IDEA Center for the Voices of Humanity to honor an individual who embodies the spirit of George Bailey by consistently contributing to the lives of his or her neighbors, and without whom Seneca Falls would be a very different place. The IDEA Center also runs the It’s A Wonderful Life Museum at 32 Fall St.

 # Webster students hold Thanksgiving food drive
 Messenger Post Media
 Monroe County Post
 Traditionally, Webster Schroeder High School students run a food drive in the fall to provide Thanksgiving meals to families assisted by the Mt. Hope Family Center. The pandemic looked to put a damper on this year’s collection since there were fewer students on campus; however, three resilient Warriors and their adviser came up with an alternative.
 Under the guidance of teacher Elizabeth Gefell, seniors Rachel Kucewicz, Giuliana Zane and Eve Kowalczyk rallied students, staff, family and friends to feed as many Rochester area families as possible.
 Instead of asking for physical food donations, they asked for tax-deductible contributions made out directly to the Mt. Hope Family Center Thanksgiving Basket Fundraiser. This way they didn’t need to venture into grocery stores to shop for turkeys and there was no need for someone from Mt. Hope to come on campus to pick up the food.
 The trio sought to raise $1,700 to feed 20 families. By their deadline of Nov. 20, the girls brought in $1,844.
 Mt. Hope Family Center is dedicated to improving the lives of children and families who experienced violence, abuse, neglect or trauma.

We've gotten our best look at Dragon Age 4 yet in the first proper trailer for the game, thanks to its big debut at The Game Awards.
 The trailer revealed that it's time for a new hero to take center stage in this story, though they may have some familiar allies to help them out along the way. As GamesRadar previously reported, we knew at the end of last week that BioWare would be giving us an "early look" at Dragon Age 4 - but it certainly felt like the wait took ages, didn't it?
 The CGI trailer moves through some new and familiar scenes from the series, and it ends on a face that Dragon Age fans love to hate: Solas is back, and it looks like you'll be going up against him head-on in the course of the story.
 This is by far the most info we've gotten about the next game in the Dragon Age franchise since the first official teaser debuted during The Game Awards 2018. That teaser featured Solas as well, who ominously greeted us after some tantalizing images appeared on-screen. Since then, we've only gotten a few pieces of concept art and a psuedo-update on the game during EA Play Live (it wasn't even mentioned by name).
 And as we previously reported when Dragon Age 4 surprised us all with an appearance during Gamescom Opening Night, the brief tidbits of information and concept art left us with more questions than answers about the upcoming title - though we are still waiting on the actual name.
  _The_ _executive producer of Dragon Age 4 recently left BioWare_ _, but he says the game is in good hands._

GENEVA — Maureen Ballatori and her 29 Design Studio at 100 Castle St. are on a roll.
 Last year, Ballatori’s marketing firm helped Real Eats of Geneva win a $1 million grand prize in the international Grow-NY food and agriculture competition. In 2020, her firm helped Leep Foods of Chili, Monroe County, prepare and submit its application for the Grow-NY competition — and the 29 Design Studio client won a $250,000 start-up prize.
 Leep Foods is a grower and wholesale distributor of a “super food,” organic mushrooms.
 Ballatori, who founded 29 Design Studio in 2007, heads a staff of six. Her office is in the Port 100 building at the corner of Castle and Genesee streets. Her marketing firm helps cultivate and grow successful food and agriculture brands.
 “We’ve been working with Leep Foods since March,” Ballatori relayed. “They had applied for the Grow-NY competition last year and wanted to take another stab at it this year. We worked hand-in-glove with the Leep Foods team on their application, branding, marketing strategy and pitch, and boy, did it pay off.
 “This is the kind of work that gets my blood flowing.”
 Ballatori said her team tries to “drive talented teams forward and being ingrained in the upstate New York region and connecting smart people who love food and ag as much as we do.”
 “When you have it pay off like this two years in a row, I’m speechless. I’m on cloud nine,” she said.

The little refugee was let off at the border as best we could tell. A drive-by drop-off no doubt…smack dab at the end of our driveway. The fluff of orange was caught perching near the bottle calf in the midst of the straw, in the midst of the wooden shelter.
 The need for companionship for these two little vagabonds seeking a place to belong in the cold, cruel world was a survival tactic to say the least. Teaming up was doable, and so they did.
 Pete, my farmer, caught a glimpse of the two every so oft as soft-like they did gather, feeding from the trough. Like all farmers, he tenderly tends to those in his care as life depends on him. Expanding on what he dropped in the trough, he sprinkled a little cat food round and about in hopes the Christmas Kitty would take note. As the weather had turned cold and the snow remained silently upon the ground, the little ball of fluff was desperate for food and eagerly partook of the portions.
 For a few weeks he had mentioned there was a stray on the loose. He’d managed to not only catch a glimpse, but grabbed hold of it, allowing it to cozy up so to speak. It wasn’t until he stood in the crack of the door holding the little kitty that I, too, took note.
 Entering into the kitchen the little creature came. Its contented purring was heard like a rattle of love joining in. As I cuddled, the kitty’s pronounced ribcage made it known just how famished it had been. Soon, the creature dashed from our arms as it ran full blast to the small plate of tuna we’d spread out like a feast.
 Knowing what goes in must come out, I searched frantically for what might suffice and suffice it to say just that very day a box had been delivered upon the front porch. Now, it stood empty for such a time as this. With a bit of ingenuity, I sacrificed one potted plant and the soil beneath it to do the trick and that was that.
 The rest is history. The little orange fluffy kitty soon had a name. “Let’s call her Matti,” was the suggestion made. After all, she had plenty of those in her fur so it sorta, kinda stuck if you know what I mean.
 After hours passed, I could tell that ultimately the little refugee didn’t need me as much as I needed it. Thinking about something other than myself was rather refreshing...a gift really. Meeting the needs of others just brings out the best I guess.
 Luke 6:38 wraps it up as gift. “Give and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.”
 Just a little food for kitty...and just a little food for thought. Amen.

A Waco man with mental health issues charged with threatening his parents with a knife was released from jail Thursday after he pleaded guilty to a reduced charge and was given credit for the 414 days he has been jailed.
 Thomas Olsen Pena, 37, pleaded guilty to a Class A misdemeanor charge of repeated violations of a protective order after prosecutors reduced the charge from a third-degree felony and offered Pena 135 days in jail as part of a plea bargain.
 A Waco psychologist determined Pena should be found not guilty by reason of insanity and hospitalized to treat schizoaffective disorder bipolar type, but the McLennan County District Attorney's Office disputed that opinion and said Pena's fate should be determined by a jury. With the coronavirus shutting down trials since early this year, Pena languished in jail for more than a year before the DA's office offered him the plea agreement, which essentially would allow him to walk free from jail after his guilty plea to the misdemeanor charge.

After her family immigrated to Israel when Cidor was 10, the holiday was mostly abandoned, as it was by many North African Jewish families after they immigrated to Israel. But in recent years, Cidor has made an effort to bring it back.
 “We do it on and off for now,” said Cidor, 69, a journalist and mother of three who lives in Jerusalem. “But we finally have a granddaughter in the family and it’s coming back.”
 Cidor is not alone in seeking to revive a tradition that is scarcely observed anymore even among Jews living in Tunisia, its country of origin. The World Federation of Tunisian Jewry in Israel has celebrated the day for the past 15 years, producing a festive event for about 200 participants that culminates with an homage to prominent female members of the community.
 That event won’t happen this year because of the coronavirus pandemic, but two others will be taking place online. On Dec. 17, the advocacy group Jews Indigenous to the Middle East and North Africa and the Mizrachi Dance Archive are organizing an online Benat concert featuring the Israeli singer Lala Tamar and Jackie Barzvi, a dancer based in North Carolina. A separate Benat event is being organized by Luz Haivri, which seeks to connect secular Israelis with some of the Jewish calendar’s lesser known dates.
 Celebrating Benat with large public events is a departure from its traditional intimate setting, but one born of necessity, according to Miryam Guez-Avigal, the chairwoman of the World Federation of Tunisian Jewry in Israel.
 “Initially, this is a holiday that happened in the family or between close friends,” Guez-Avigal said. “But that’s no longer possible because Tunisian Jews are dispersed all over Israel now. You need a Jewish population concentrated in one place to celebrate it the way it used to be.”
 Though mostly a Tunisian custom, Rosh Chodesh el Benat is also celebrated by Moroccan, Algerian and Libyan Jews. Many believe the holiday was created to celebrate events described in the Book of Judith, an ancient Jewish story whose namesake kills an Assyrian general whose troops had ruthlessly quelled a Jewish rebellion.
 “I was always told this is the holiday of Judith, a brave Jewish woman who saved the people of Israel,” said Ayala Sitbon, a 74-year-old retired teacher from Jerusalem who immigrated to Israel from Tunisia in 1967. Her parents used to celebrate the holiday every year, but she and her husband and their two children gradually abandoned it.
 Other traditions have it that the holiday is a female counterpart to a celebration of Jewish boys, Shabbat Yitro, observed on the 24th of the Hebrew month of Shevat, a date that coincides with the reading of the Torah portion that contains the story of Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses.
 It’s “a holiday that women created because they needed to transmit Judaism in an alternative way to how it was done by the men, who unlike women studied Hebrew and the Torah,” said Aliza Lavie, a former Israeli lawmaker who has written about Jewish traditions unique to women and will participate in the Luz Haivri event.
 Cidor sees Benat as a reflection of the relatively strong status of women among the Jews of Tunisia, which is one of the Arab world’s most progressive countries when it comes to women’s rights.
 “Women had a high status in Tunisian Jewry,” Cidor said. “They weren’t encouraged to join the army or anything, but they were cherished, spoiled, regarded as a gift to the family, and they were educated by the network of Alliance French schools. A Jewish Tunisian woman with a high school diploma was normal even decades ago.”

 Waco police responded to a call at 11:14 a.m. Thursday to the Oak Tree Apartments at 800 Rambler Drive about a disturbance involving multiple people with weapons, according to a Waco PD press release. One of the first officers who arrived saw a man who was reportedly part of the disturbance get into a car and leave.
 The pursuit began when the driver refused an officer's attempt to stop him, police said. During the pursuit, the driver struck a curb, damaging multiple tires, and stopped in the 3100 block of Franklin Avenue, where several people ran away from the vehicle, police said.

December may be the season of giving, but it’s typically a challenging time to collect enough blood donations. Add in a pandemic, and this year could be even tougher than usual. That’s why the American Red Cross is urging those who are feeling well to give the gift of life by donating blood this holiday season.
 The need for blood doesn’t stop for holidays. Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, more than 1 million blood transfusions will be given in the United States. Donations of all blood types are needed to ensure hospital shelves remain stocked to meet patient blood needs.
 Make your appointment to give blood, platelets or plasma with the Red Cross by downloading the Red Cross Blood Donor App, visiting RedCrossBlood.org, calling (800) RED CROSS (800-733-2767) or enabling the Blood Donor Skill on any Alexa Echo device.
 To encourage donations this holiday season, those who come to donate blood, platelets or plasma with the Red Cross Dec. 18-Jan. 4 will receive a long- sleeved Red Cross T-shirt, while supplies last.
 Important COVID-19 information for donors
 As COVID-19 hospitalizations increase, hospital demand for convalescent plasma has also grown. COVID-19 convalescent plasma is a type of blood donation given by those who've recovered from this coronavirus. Their plasma contains antibodies that may help patients actively fighting the virus. Learn more about convalescent plasma and sign up to give at RedCrossBlood.org/Plasma4COVID
 The Red Cross is testing blood, platelet and plasma donations for COVID-19 antibodies. The test may indicate if the donor’s immune system has produced antibodies to this coronavirus, regardless of whether an individual developed COVID-19 symptoms. Red Cross antibody tests will be helpful to identify individuals who have COVID-19 antibodies and may now help current coronavirus patients in need of convalescent plasma transfusions. Convalescent plasma is a type of blood donation collected from COVID-19 survivors that have antibodies that may help patients who are actively fighting the virus.
 COVID-19 antibody test results will be available within one to two weeks in the Red Cross Blood Donor App or donor portal at RedCrossBlood.org. A positive antibody test result does not confirm infection or immunity. The Red Cross is not testing donors to diagnose illness, referred to as a diagnostic test. To protect the health and safety of Red Cross staff and donors, it is important that individuals who do not feel well or believe they may be ill with COVID-19 postpone donation.
 Each Red Cross blood drive and donation center follows the highest standards of safety and infection control, and additional precautions — including temperature checks, social distancing and face coverings for donors and staff — have been implemented to help protect the health of all those in attendance. Donors are asked to schedule an appointment prior to arriving at the drive and are required to wear a face covering or mask while at the drive, in alignment with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention public guidance.
