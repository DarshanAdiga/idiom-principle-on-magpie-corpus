Anakapalle MLA Gudivada Amarnath on Tuesday hit out at TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu and his son Nara Lokesh for making sweeping allegations against the YSRCP government on Twitter and other social media platforms unable to stomach the severe drubbing experienced by their party in the general elections.
 Referring to a series of postings by Mr. Naidu and Mr. Lokesh in the social media over alleged delay in distribution of seeds and ensuring quality power supply, he told reporters here that the father-son duo was behaving like laughing stock after faring badly in the elections.
 “They should remember that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has done many things in 40 days unlike the achievements of Mr. Naidu in his 40 years of political career and 14-year stint as Chief Minister,” he pointed out.
 Mr. Amarnath said Mr. Naidu should know the fact that Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy had already finalised the roadmap for implementation of 60% of promises he had made in the election manifesto and blamed the five-year TDP regime for handing over an exchequer with a loan burden of ₹2.5 lakh crore and outstanding dues of ₹48,000 crore towards various works and Rs18,000 crore to the power distribution companies.
 On Mr. Lokesh, he said he was made Panchayat Raj Minister without the eligibility to get elected as a panchayat president. He said Mr. Naidu and his son should learn the art of behaving responsibly and honouring election mandate.
 He said the people were appreciating the way Mr. Jagan had ushered in good governance with a promise to fulfil all the promises made by him during the elections.

 ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Florida International's James Morgan led two first- quarter scoring drives and Charlotte's Benny LeMay rushed for two touchdowns to lead the East to a 31-27 victory in the East-West Shrine Bowl on Saturday.
 LeMay's 9-yard TD run with just under two minutes remaining sealed offensive MVP honors for the 5-foot-8, 216-pound running back in the nation's longest- running college football all-star game, which was played at Tropicana Field.
 Morgan started at quarterback for the East and shared playing time with Princeton's Kevin Davidson and Mississippi State's Tommy Stevens, who led his team downfield for the winning TD after the West took a 27-24 lead on James Robinson's 63-yard scoring run.
 Robinson, a Rockford Lutheran graduate who rushed for 1,899 yards and 18 touchdowns for Illinois State this season, finished with 80 yards rushing on seven attempts. He gained an additional 56 yards on two pass receptions, one a 46-yarder that led to a field goal. Robinson is the IHSA's all-time leading rusher.
 Utah's Tyler Huntley threw a 7-yard TD pass to San Diego State tight end Parker Houston and North Texas' Mason Fine tossed a 36-yard scoring pass to Ohio State's Binjimon Victor to help the West wipe out an early two-touchdown deficit and make it 17-all heading into the fourth quarter.
 Morgan, meanwhile, continued to state his case as a potential pick in the NFL draft by completing 9 of 14 passes for 116 yards, including a 9-yard TD throw to Louisiana's Ja'Marcus Bradley to finish the East's game-opening drive.
 Navy wide receiver Macolm Perry took a direct snap from center and sprinted 52 yards for a TD on his only carry. Versatile UCF running back Adrian Killins Jr. had only one rushing attempt but led the East with seven catches for 91 yards, including a 37-yard reception on the game-winning drive.
 Stevens also had an 18-yard completion to Rhode Island's Aaron Parker to set up LeMay's second touchdown.

AS A senior softball umpire, Lismore man Jesse Smith has dealt with a few high-stress situations.
 During a game between China and Chinese Taipei, a pro-democracy political protest broke out at the stadium and Smith had to to evacuate the field safely when neither team spoke English.
 He also officiated at the world championships in the US last year.
 But Smith reckons umpiring is the best job in the sport.
 Off the diamond, hes’s the assistant principal at Trinity Catholic College and chairman of Jodie’s Inspiration.
 Now the internationally accredited umpire‒  who has been on Softball NSW’s executive team for nine years ‒ said he was thrilled to be helping the next generation of umpires to come through the sport.
 “The last week I’ve been at the National Championships in Melbourne assessing candidates for Level 5 Umpire accreditation,” Smith said.
 “It’s important to help the next generation of umpires.”
 In Melbourne, Smith was awarded a Level 7 Umpire accreditation, which he said was an honourary ranking recognising service to the sport on and off the field.
 He said umpiring requires good communication and people management skills as well as the ability to manage stressful situations.
 “Twenty years ago I started playing softball at ModanviIle Primary School,” he said.
 “I did play at a reasonable level in state championships but it became pretty apparent I was not going to excel on the diamond as a player and I found umpiring interesting.”
 Smith said there was a lot more to the role than blowing the whistle and calling “play ball”.
 A highlight was being selected to umpire at the Junior Women’s Softball World Championships held in the US in 2019.
 “Being selected to umpire the XIII WBSC U-19 Women’s Softball World Cup in Irvine, California last August was fantastic,” he said.
 “It’s very intense, requires a great deal of concentration, effort and game management, particularly when you have cultural and language barriers.
 “And it’s high stakes, you have to be able to be exposed to pressure and not be found wanting.”
 Smith said the benefits of umpiring included “having the best seat in the house”, while the worst was “getting a free character assessment from players and spectators”.

For merchants to be successful traveling throughout various regions and cultures, it was vital for them to gain the trust of their buyers. They were not able to revisit regions without the welcome of the community. Communities then made investments in businesses to share the success and profits.
 This led to a focus not only on the profit of the seller, but also on the satisfaction of the buyers and the contribution to society. In fact, it was imperative for the merchants to focus on the long-term sustainability of their market in order to maintain their success.
 Fast forward to the 20th century. While the philosophy of sanpō yoshi continued throughout the decades, Japanese businesses adopted the more modern idea of shareholder capitalism in an effort to rapidly catch up and rebuild the nation's economy after World War II. The emphasis on shareholder capitalism strengthened as businesses were increasingly exposed to global competition.
 Today, we see another welcoming shift of the pendulum toward long-term, sustainable value creation as we face the impacts of globalization, the climate crisis and demographic shifts. Leveraging on sanpō yoshi, Japan is in a position to further expand on this philosophy.
 Emulating what worked in the past is not enough. We live in the 21st century, the era of the "Fourth Industrial Revolution," where the advancement of technology pushes societal issues to a global context and connects all at speeds we have never seen in the past.
 The accelerated nature of change also means that businesses can no longer stay in their comfort zones. The nature of business has shifted, and the business practices of the past have become vulnerable. It is no longer about thriving, but surviving -- and surviving well. For example, the climate crisis may not have been on top of the priority list for businesses a decade ago, but it is today. The realization that a company's stakeholders are global citizens leaves no option but to pursue a shift in approach.
 In today's fast-paced world, innovation has become one of the crucial aspects of growth. The World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report 2019 finds that Japan ranks sixth out of 141 economies, yet there is more work to be done, and the challenges for the country are clear. The nation needs to work on improving its workforce diversity, acting to close its skills gap and increasing female participation. To do so, it must address its high levels of risk aversion and rigid corporate culture, while spurring innovation and promoting business dynamism.
 To further accelerate the importance of stakeholder capitalism, the World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting 2020, under the theme, "Stakeholders for a Cohesive and Sustainable World," will focus on the six imperatives of ecology, economy, society, technology, industry and geopolitics. Leaders from the private and public sectors will discuss how to take a long-term approach to address key issues in those areas, as well as evolve to meet the demands of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, while staying inclusive at the same time.
 Leveraging on the heritage of sanpō yoshi, Japan has the opportunity to become a leader in stakeholder capitalism in the Fourth Industrial Revolution era.

I have not run a marathon. I haven't even run a half-marathon. There have been no 5Ks, either. It's been more than a year since I've done any hiking.
   
 I love kayaking, but my kidney issues eliminated that for most of last year. Yes, I walk the dog twice a day and put in about 3 to 4 miles a day, but that is about it. I go to bed early and get decent sleep.
   
 I'm tired.
   
 Some people worry I do too much. Funny. I think I do less than I ever have before. Sometimes it's not easy to put together three lessons a week, write this column and perform my normal chaplain duties with the police department. But it's not like I'm on overload.
   
 Teaching double studies on Wednesday can strain the energy reserves, but it's not all that bad. Yes, Saturday night service and then again on Sunday morning is my most tiring venture, but it's not like I'm working a construction or roofing job.
   
 I'm just tired.
   
 Maybe I'm getting older and I'm starting to slow down. The right knee is a little bit of a problem, and I'm sure there is some arthritis hanging around. My family has been plagued with the big A through the generations. I limp sometimes, but as the doctor told me a few months ago, other than carrying a few extra pounds, I'm in good health.
   
 I'm tired in my brain.
   
 I'm tired of death. I actually prayed that this past Sunday during our prayer time in church. I was honest with God. I heard an affirming mumbling in the crowd. It's been one of those seasons.
   
 Today I got word that a friend's son died from an accidental overdose. That will make the 18th person I have been associated with in some way who has died since three days before Thanksgiving. That is 18 in 45 days. I have had to face death once every two and a half days, and I'm sick and tired of it.
   
 Most of the people who have gone before us have been believers in Jesus Christ. Yes, there is a great hope associated with people of the faith. But it still stings. Jesus understood that sting. In the beginning of his ministry, he blessed those who mourn. He connected with all of us in the loss of those we love.
   
 Jesus understands and affirms our humanity and its relative limitations. Later on, he wept at the death of Lazarus. We don't know why he wept, but his emotions came pouring out of him. If Christ can weep, so can I, and so can you.
   
 Tears display great love. We don't cry over those we don't love (most of the time). A friend of mine recently suffered the loss of his wife who battled cancer for years. Even having time to prepare, he said, "I don't know where all the tears come from." I do! They come from the heart.
   
 I'm tired of crying.
   
 I got shocked yesterday. I was looking at the obituaries from my mother's funeral home and a local one as well. I was shocked at the amount of young people who are dying in our communities. I expected the old ones like me. There were more than I expected in their 30s and early 40s. Death has no respect for age or position.
   
 I'm tired of losing my friends and family.
   
 A friend contacted me when my mom died. He put it the best. He said, "John, you know all the platitudes, and you can quote all the right verses. However, death still sucks." I could have kissed him right there. It does. It's the result of the curse, and the curse in Genesis 3 comes from sin. I know all the facts. It doesn't make it any better.
   
 There is only one answer. Maybe I have crossed a line in my life where I will start to stare at the obituaries, looking for friends from long ago like my dad did. Or maybe I'm more aware than ever that there is an answer.
   
 The only answer for the plague of death is for Jesus to return and redeem this world as he said in the book of Revelation. I used to think only the crazy people said things like, "Come quickly, Lord Jesus." Now I see that they aren't crazy. They are the realists.
   
 Come, Lord Jesus. I'm tired.

Now, McElwain is entrenched. She travels to the OU meets that make sense for her, including one in St. Louis when she was in college. She went to Norman last year when the Sooners hosted Florida, and attends the NCAA championships.
 Once, she won a drawing to eat brunch with OU coach K.J. Kindler. She joined Kindler and athletic director Joe Castiglione at Ozzie’s Diner, armed with lots of questions.
 McElwain is in a Twitter messaging group with two other OU super fans she’s never met in person. One lives in Brazil, the other in Spain.
 This is the level of fandom associated with OU’s fastest-growing sport on campus. The Sooners enter Monday’s 1:30 p.m. home opener against Arkansas coming off a national championship season that greatly expanded the program's reach.
 The setup at Lloyd Noble Center is changing to accommodate more fans than ever after attendance records fell last year. The hope is that new fans join the party. But OU women’s gymnastics is already carrying its share of diehards — some who have been around longer than others.
 Iowa native Rocco Russo and his partner, Bob VanZuuk, are the most dedicated of the bunch. In the past they might miss one meet a year, Russo said, although they already expect to miss two this season.
 It began with Russo, who knew Kindler from when she was an Iowa State gymnast, then assistant, then head coach years ago. Russo was the Cyclones’ volunteer public-address announcer from 1987 to 2006 and the two developed a friendship.
 Russo enjoyed her choreography and company at first. But once he started going to OU meets, he fell in love with the program. He and VanZuuk became donors in 2008 and now sit in up-close, reserved seating known as The Couch at the arena.
 The couple go to great lengths to make sure they’re watching the Sooners on the road too, using vacation time from their jobs at a Des Moines children’s hospital in order to travel. They've even attended weddings of former OU gymnasts
 Why this level of dedication?
 Russo tried to explain when a woman working a Norman rental car counter asked him why in the world two Iowans were traveling during the winter to watch a gymnastics team from Oklahoma.
 “I said, ‘You’ve got one of the best women’s gymnastics teams in the country here,’” Russo said. “She said, ‘Really?’”
 OU is increasingly trying to remind people nearby of that. Amid its perfect 32-0 season, which resulted in its third national title in four years, the program had a breakthrough in fan interest last season.

One of my favorite holiday movies is "Home Alone." In the 1990 comedy, the McCallister family is planning a trip to Paris for the holidays, but oversleeps on the morning of their departure, which causes havoc. In their rush leave, the family accidentally forgets their youngest child, 8-year-old Kevin, and leave him home alone.
   
 Chances are, you've seen the movie and you probably know the antics that ensue as Kevin protects the family's Chicago home from burglars.
   
 But a scene I've always loved is the one of the large family rushing through the airport and barely making it on the plane. They get settled and after the plane takes off, the mother gasps "KEVIN!"
   
 Now, I've never forgotten a child at home while on vacation, thank God. Vacations are stressful enough.
   
 And while I've always loved the scene of the family rushing through the airport, trying to get to the gate on time, it's recently occurred to me how simpler things must have been for airline passengers in a pre-9/11 world.
   
 The McAllister family obviously wasn't delayed by security. They didn't have to take off their shoes and their jackets. They didn't have to go through a full body scan machine. You don't see Kevin's family dragging carry-on size suitcases through the terminal in their rush for the gate. Today, the cost of checked luggage is so high, but back then then it was free.
   
 And chances are, the parents didn't have to worry about what food options there were in that terminal because in 1990 most flights still provided food other than pretzels. (Although, I suppose, a transcontinental flight to Europe still provides meals.)
   
 Last month, my family of five flew to California for New Year's. It was part family vacation--we took the kids to Disneyland and the San Diego Zoo. But it was a serious trip too, as we finally had a memorial service for our dad and spread some of his ashes at sea. We also finished emptying out the family home of the last 50 years.
   
 We spent every second of that trip trying to make memories and enjoy the time with the kids, which meant the last day was rushed. Thirty minutes after our original "leave" time for the airport, I was still trying to cram everything into our carry-on size suitcases.
   
 There were five of us, including our 10, 8 and 4-year-old kids. And there were six suitcases, five which were carry-on size (I'm not paying a fortune to check suitcases), three backpacks, a purse, my grandmother's ashes in an urn and a Star Wars robot from Disneyland. We looked like a herd of bogged-down camels, rushing to get to the airport.
   
 Despite leaving later than planned, we returned the rental car and got to the terminal in decent time. We exited the rental car shuttle, entered an elevator that took us to the ticketing section of Terminal 4 at LAX airport, and then headed for the American Airlines desk. When we got to the self-help kiosk to get our boarding passes, I stopped to count my children. There were two -- but we have three children.
   
 "Where's Eliza?" I asked my two oldest kids, referring to their 4-year-old little sister. They shrugged. I asked my husband, in panic, "Where's Eliza?" He looked at our kids, then looked down the terminal where we had just dragged all of our belongings.
   
 I shouted. "ELIZA?!?" which reverberated against the terminal's two-story ceilings. People turned around to look. I shouted again. My husband then dropped the bags and ran.
   
 I told our older kids not to move and to stay with the bags, and then also ran down the ticketing hall, shouting Eliza's name.
   
 She wasn't even in the building.
   
 She was only gone a couple of minutes at most. A kind stranger saw my panicked husband and pointed him outside, where our scared pre-schooler stood on the sidewalk outside the airport next to the traffic. An airline attendant noticed our daughter all alone and was holding her hand. For that, I am so grateful.
   
 Apparently, when we boarded the elevator as we first entered the airport, there were two doors, one that led inside the airport, and the other, which led back outside. As we exited the elevator toward the ticketing hall inside LAX, our daughter thought we were going back outside, and had walked through the wrong door.
   
 Unlike "Home Alone" it was no comedy situation. It will probably be one of those moments I'll tell my grandkids about one day, the time we lost a kid in LAX. Hopefully by then we'll be able to laugh about it. For now, I'm still trying to calm my nerves.

 It's January, and if you are like me, you've made a few New Year's resolutions.
 Every year I try to make some resolutions, and each year I tend to make ones that are out of reach, and I end up failing. I have a rResolution for you that is doable and one that could save your life.
 It's to end distracted driving. It only takes 21 days to change a habit. This is your time to change bad habits into good and safe ones while behind the wheel.
 I challenge all drivers in Bluffton, whether you just started driving or if you've been driving for 80 years, to please take the next 21 days to really focus on doing the driving safety checklist every time you get into your vehicle.
 All you need to do is, sit in the driver's seat and take 43 seconds to make sure you have a clear head, clear hands, clear eyes, and click it.

At last, for the third time overall, the Chiefs (14-4) are Super Bowl bound.
 “I mean, it’s amazing. It really is,” Mahomes said. “To be here, to be a part of Chiefs Kingdom and to be able to do it here at Arrowhead, these people deserve it. And, we’re not done yet.”
 Adding to the joy of the achievement, coach Andy Reid and owner Clark Hunt accepted the Lamar Hunt Trophy — named after his father — emblematic of the AFC title. It was handed over to them by Chiefs Hall of Famer Bobby Bell, with Mahomes and safety Tyrann Mathieu jumping for joy on the makeshift stage.
 Next up: chasing the Vince Lombardi Trophy.
 “Very excited and very emotional to win the trophy that has my dad’s name on it,’’ Hunt said. “Yeah, 50 years were too long, but we’re going to another Super Bowl.
 “Chiefs Kingdom, we are going to the Super Bowl.’’
 The Chiefs lost in 1967 in the first AFL-NFL Championship Game — nope, it wasn’t called the Super Bowl yet — to the Lombardi Packers 35-10. Three years later, one year after the New York Jets shocked Baltimore to lay claim to the AFL being equal to the long-established NFL, Kansas City was back. This time, it was known as the Super Bowl — indeed, Lamar Hunt is credited with coming up with the name — and his Chiefs hammered Minnesota 23-7 with the typical Wild West offensive flair and a staunch defense. Those are characteristics that helped carry KC this season.

An uber-fluid power play ended with Charlie Gerard finishing a tic-tac-toe passing play around the Falcon defense, giving Minnesota State a 1-0 lead.
 Conquest was launched on a breakaway by a silky smooth Brandon Kruse pass and he delivered a backhand dish through the legs of Dryden McKay, leveling the game 1-1.
 “I finally got the monkey off my back. It’s been about 12 games,” Conquest said. “I thought I wasn’t producing as much as I could and I thought I might as well work my tail off.”
 From then on, Mankato’s speed was on full display. Numerous chances came after forwards powered their way past Bowling Green defenders for odd-man rushes. Marc Michaelis was first to notch a goal but was answered just eight seconds later by Conquest again. He redirected a Tim Theocharidis point shot off the back wall and into the net.
 “They can take advantage of the smallest opportunity. You can get away with (certain mistakes) against somebody else, but you can’t against them,” Eigner said.
 Then, Josh French, Julian Napravnik and Riese Zmolek scored three consecutive goals for the Mavericks. Despite a second-period intermission video session and a tip-in goal from Sam Craggs, the Falcons could not mount a comeback, with Nick Rivera sealing the game on an empty net.
 “They’re a really difficult team to chase,” Eigner said. “When their forwards get going, they are really dangerous. Especially that Tuomie-Michaelis line.”

Connor Ford put on a showcase of what a team needs to do to beat Minnesota State to open the scoring. He bowled into the Maverick puck carrier on his way out the MSU zone before keeping the puck in the zone from a prone position. He managed to keep possession, drove to the net and drew a penalty that set up his one-timer shot from the slot no more than five seconds into the man advantage.
 Up 1-0 after the first frame, Bowling Green needed to weather the storm Mankato is known to bring as games move along. Coming into the game the Mavericks have scored 31 goals in the second period and 40 in the third, both ranking first in the conference.
 Bowling Green had also totaled 31 second period goals this season and had built a lot of momentum from the middle frame in the past, until recently giving up a 3-1 lead to Northern Michigan in a 4-3 OT loss.
 The Falcons connected on the power play again as Cameron Wright scored his team-leading 15th goal of the season in the second period.
 “We had two power play goals and things were humming along until the third,” Eigner said. “Then we had a bunch of guys who were tired and not exactly at their best.”
 After killing off six straight penalties, the Falcons’ penalty kill unit was due to give something up to the nation’s number one power play. What would wind up being the beginning of the end for the Falcons, Alec Rauhauser fell victim to his second penalty of the night and Parker Tuomie netted one from the blueline past Eric Dop to make the score 2-1.
 “Discipline is a big thing for us. It’s something we key on every night,” Ford said. “But we do want to win the special teams battle. They gave us too many opportunities for how dangerous we are, and we gave them too many opportunities for how dangerous they are.”
 Josh French tipped in an Andy Carroll shot with just about three minutes left in the game make things evened up at 2 after Dop couldn’t hold onto his stick.
 Nathan Smith found a deflected puck right on the doorstep of Dop and buried a backhand to give Mankato a 3-2 win and a sweep of Bowling Green.

 As it stands now, Bowling Green sits in fifth place in the WCHA standings and are going to have to compete for home-ice advantage in the conference playoff tournament. Their final few series against Bemidji State, Alaska Anchorage, Alaska Fairbanks, Ferris State and Alabama Huntsville will feature some must- win games and even must-sweep series in order to stay in the top half of the seeding.
 “For us it’s about putting ourselves in a better position come playoffs,” Ford said. “It’s going to be virtually impossible to catch (Minnesota State), but we can put ourselves in second or third place which would really help.”
 BGSU falls to 13-11-2 on the season after the sweep and could see unfamiliar territory not only in the standings but in the win column as well. Their streak of five consecutive seasons with 20 wins may be snapped with only 10 games left in the year. The team is hoping these important games leading up to the playoffs will bring a taste of what could be come postseason play.
 “We’re in a push for home ice which is unfamiliar territory for us,” Eigner said. “At the end of the day, we want to play our best hockey. Playing hockey the way you saw us play for long stretches tonight, We know if we can do that we can be a tough one for anybody, but it is kind of like the playoffs right now for us.”

By Helaine Fendelman and Joe Rosson
   
 Tribune News Service
   
 (TNS) -- Dear Helaine and Joe:
   
 I inherited this chest from my parents. It was shipped to them from Saudi Arabia in 1968, and they referred to it as the "Kuwaiti chest." My father said it was dug up in the desert somewhere. It measures 52 inches wide by 22 inches tall. Any information would be appreciated, and should I be concerned about sun damage since I have it in a room under a window?
   
 Thank you,
   
 L
   
 Dear L.
   
 This and similar chests are called by a variety of names. "Kuwaiti chest" is one of them. They are also referred to as Shirazi chests (if they show any kind of Persian influence in the design) and Zanzibar chests. They are also known as Omani chests and more generically "Arab chests."
   
 A Kuwaiti chest is sometimes associated with storage in the captain's quarters of a seagoing dhow, which is a lateen-rigged (slanted triangular sail) ship that is thought to have originated in India. We also found that at least some of the chests might have been decorated by seamen on dhows during long voyages.
   
 Dhows are often associated with Middle Eastern and Indian vessels sailing in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean but can also be found on the Nile River. Depending on the size, a dhow can have a crew of between 12 and 30. But we think this particular chest was far too large to have been housed in the captain's cabin of a dhow and was probably not decorated by a ship's crew.
   
 Instead, we think it is a dower chest -- the chest a young woman brought to her new home containing both her material wealth and items she would need to set up housekeeping. We do not have a photograph to substantiate this, but we suspect the top on the piece raises up to reveal an interior that probably has a lidded till along the side at the top of the interior that was designed to hold valuables such as jewelry and/or money.
   
 As for the piece having been dug up in the desert, we doubt if this is literally true. Such a circumstance would have damaged the piece terribly, but it may have some figurative or metaphoric meaning. We believe the piece was actually made in India (some sources suggest near the Pakistan border or even in Pakistan itself), and the wood is probably either teak or shisham (aka Dalbergia sissoo), also called Bombay blackwood or North Indian rosewood.
   
 The beautifully decorated dower chest is probably late 19th or early 20th century and shows English influence in the batwing pulls on the bottom drawer fronts. We suggest keeping the beautiful piece out of direct sunlight because it will eventually fade the wood on the top. This would diminish aesthetic and monetary value.
   
 We have seen similar Kuwaiti dower chests sell for very little at auction (less than $500), but at retail we have found them priced at more than $3,000. This leaves us in a bit of a quandary, but we feel the chest should be insured in the $2,500-$3,000 range.

El pase a los dieciseisavos de final de la Copa del Rey del CD Tenerife en Majadahonda y la eliminacion de la UD Las Palmas en Badajoz abrio un escenario casi inedito en la semana previa el enfrentamiento de rivalidad. Sera la segunda vez en 54 clasicos en la que un equipo compita dias antes y el otro descanse. No sera excusa, puesto que Ruben Baraja rotara a muchos de sus titulares el proximo miercoles (Heliodoro Rodriguez Lopez, 20:00 horas) ante el Real Valladolid. Pero si un elemento a tener en consideracion.
 Los dos equipos jugaron ayer domingo. El conjunto blanquiazul recibio al Girona y el amarillo visito al Racing de Santander. Por tanto, los de Pepe Mel tendran que emprender el viaje de regreso a las Islas antes de disponer de una jornada de descanso. El Tenerife no tendra dia libre. Desde hoy preparara ya la visita de un Primera, algo que no sucedia desde la campaña 17/18, cuando aterrizo el Espanyol en el feudo capitalino.
 Esta circunstancia, la de tener partido durante la semana y Las Palmas no, ya se dio en la temporada 88/89. Por entonces, el equipo que dirigia Benito Joanet entro antes que su maximo rival en el bombo de la Copa. Debio enfrentarse al Telde grancanario cuatro dias antes del gran derbi y supero el trance sin apuros (5-0). Luego, tampoco le fue mal ante los amarillos. Victor Matute, Perico Medina y David Amaral anotaron para los locales, Onofre hizo el del honor para los visitantes (3-1).
 El resto de enfrentamientos entre birrias y canariones se disputo, como mucho, con 48 horas de diferencia. En no pocas ocasiones jugaron ambos tres o cuatro dias antes. Sucedio en los cruces de Copa del Rey de 1974, 1994 y 1997 o en los de la extinta Copa de la Liga de 1983 y 1984. Tambien ocurrio recientemente en Liga. Fue en la temporada 13/14, en la que el derbi se adelanto al miercoles 4 de diciembre. Curiosamente, el encuentro anterior del Tenerife fue ante el Girona y luego aplasto a la UD (3-0) en la noche gloriosa de Ayoze Perez.

At last, for the third time overall, the Chiefs (14-4) are Super Bowl bound.
 In two weeks in Miami, they will play the winner of the NFC title game between Green Bay and San Francisco.
 "I mean, it's amazing. It really is," Mahomes said. "To be here, to be a part of Chiefs Kingdom and to be able to do it here at Arrowhead, these people deserve it. And, we're not done yet."
 Adding to the joy of the achievement, coach Andy Reid and owner Clark Hunt accepted the Lamar Hunt Trophy — named after his father — emblematic of the AFC title. It was handed over to them by Chiefs Hall of Famer Bobby Bell, with Mahomes and safety Tyrann Mathieu jumping for joy on the makeshift stage.
 Next up: chasing the Vince Lombardi Trophy.
 "Very excited and very emotional to win the trophy that has my dad's name on it," Hunt said. "Yeah, 50 years were too long, but we're going to another Super Bowl.
 "Chiefs Kingdom, we are going to the Super Bowl."
 The Chiefs lost in 1967 in the first AFL-NFL Championship Game — nope, it wasn't called the Super Bowl yet — to the Lombardi Packers 35-10. Three years later, one year after the New York Jets shocked Baltimore to lay claim to the AFL being equal to the long-established NFL, Kansas City was back. This time, it was known as the Super Bowl — indeed, Lamar Hunt is credited with coming up with the name — and his Chiefs hammered Minnesota 23-7 with the typical Wild West offensive flair and a staunch defense. Those are characteristics that helped carry KC this season.
 Reid isn't as animated as Hall of Famer Hank Stram, who famously urged the Chiefs team to "keep matriculating the ball down the field, boys." Caught up in the moment Sunday, Reid said, "It's awesome," before asking the crowd to chant "How about those Chiefs?"
 Moments later, standout tight end Travis Kelce proclaimed, "You gotta fight for your right to party."
 There will be plenty of partying on South Beach for Chiefs Kingdom heading into the championship matchup.
 "Fired up to go to Miami, got to get on a diet so I can fit into my clothes," Reid said. "Very proud."
 As they had done in their past three "elimination" games, the sixth-seeded Titans (11-8) got started quickly. The difference at Arrowhead as opposed to Houston, New England and Baltimore was that the Chiefs had Mahomes, Tyreek Hill, Sammy Watkins and Damien Williams on offense, and a vastly upgraded defense from when they lost in last year's AFC title game. Henry was held to 7 yards rushing in the second half.
 "They were doubling all these guys," Mahomes said of his spectacular TD run on which he barely stayed in bounds. "I just ran it and got some good blocking at the end and found a way to get in the end zone."
 A week after they overcame a 24-0 deficit against Houston, the Chiefs had to rally again.
 Down 10-0 and 17-7, Kansas City didn't flinch, building a 35-17 lead while controlling the clock with a strong ground game. Naturally, Mahomes complemented that with sharp passing, spreading the ball on short and deep throws. The dagger came with a 60-yard completion to Watkins for the Chiefs' 28th straight point midway in the final period.
 Mahomes thrust both arms in the air as the crowd sang Whitney Houston's "I Wanna Dance With Somebody."
 After taking a 3-0 lead on Greg Joseph's first field goal — with Tennessee's penchant for scoring in the red zone, he hadn't been called upon in his previous four games with the team — the Titans got a huge break. Bashaud Breeland appeared to make a diving interception, but replay review showed the ball hitting the ground.
 Helped by consecutive offside penalties and a fourth-down pass to Adam Humphries for his first career playoff reception, the Titans converted on, what else, Henry's 4-yard run.
 Then the Chiefs got rolling, scoring on three successive series. Hill took it in on a shovel pass, later beat top Titans cornerback Logan Ryan for a 20-yard reception, and Mahomes finished the half with his brilliant jaunt down the left sideline with half the Tennessee defense seemingly expecting him to step out of bounds.
 That gave the Chiefs a 21-17 lead. It went to 28-17 on Williams' 3-yard run to cap a seven-minute drive. Then Watkins toasted Logan for the clinching long pass.
 Henry was held to 69 yards on 19 carries after rushing for 588 yards in the past three games as an unstoppable force.
 "I feel like our backs were against the wall the whole season," Henry said. "But we kept on fighting and kept on believing in each other. I think it speaks volumes about the team we have. We just came up short."
 The Chiefs easily outrushed the Titans on Sunday. Mahomes led the way with 53 of those yards and also was 23-for-35 for 294 yards passing.
 Reid goes back to the Super Bowl for the first time since the 2004 season, when his Eagles lost to New England. That gap is second longest to Dick Vermeil's hiatus.
 "So much effort that went into this," said Reid, who joined the Chiefs in 2013 after 14 years in Philadelphia. "It takes an army, it is not one guy at all. I appreciate the effort by everybody."

The Panty Glass isn't new, but it still gets laughs. Yohei Ishii has been hand-blowing these bikini-brief-clad glasses for 14 years, ever since he was inspired by a song that his former band used to sing: "Panty Paradise."

 Honestly, these are really weird — and at times unashamedly detailed with dainty lace trimmings, polka dots, flowers and bows — but when filled with different colored beverages to adjust "skin tone," it's hard not to smile.
 Ishii makes other glassware items, including vases and ornaments, but at the end of the day his underwear-attired glasses haven't bored the pants off buyers yet.

TOKYO: Oil prices jumped on Monday after two large crude production bases in Libya began shutting down amid a military blockade, setting the stage for crude flows from the OPEC member to be cut to a trickle.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Florida International's James Morgan led two first- quarter scoring drives and Charlotte's Benny LeMay rushed for two touchdowns to lead the East to a 31-27 victory in the East-West Shrine Bowl on Saturday.
 LeMay's 9-yard TD run with just under two minutes remaining sealed offensive MVP honors for the 5-foot-8, 216-pound running back in the nation's longest- running college football all-star game, which was played at Tropicana Field.
 Morgan started at quarterback for the East and shared playing time with Princeton's Kevin Davidson and Mississippi State's Tommy Stevens, who led his team downfield for the winning TD after the West took a 27-24 lead on James Robinson's 63-yard scoring run.
 Robinson, a Rockford Lutheran graduate who rushed for 1,899 yards and 18 touchdowns for Illinois State this season, finished with 80 yards rushing on seven attempts. He gained an additional 56 yards on two pass receptions, one a 46-yarder that led to a field goal. Robinson is the IHSA's all-time leading rusher.
 Utah's Tyler Huntley threw a 7-yard TD pass to San Diego State tight end Parker Houston and North Texas' Mason Fine tossed a 36-yard scoring pass to Ohio State's Binjimon Victor to help the West wipe out an early two-touchdown deficit and make it 17-all heading into the fourth quarter.
 Morgan, meanwhile, continued to state his case as a potential pick in the NFL draft by completing 9 of 14 passes for 116 yards, including a 9-yard TD throw to Louisiana's Ja'Marcus Bradley to finish the East's game-opening drive.
 Navy wide receiver Macolm Perry took a direct snap from center and sprinted 52 yards for a TD on his only carry. Versatile UCF running back Adrian Killins Jr. had only one rushing attempt but led the East with seven catches for 91 yards, including a 37-yard reception on the game-winning drive.
 Stevens also had an 18-yard completion to Rhode Island's Aaron Parker to set up LeMay's second touchdown.

At last, for the first time since 1970 and the third time overall, the Chiefs (14-4) are Super Bowl bound.
 Adding to the joy of the achievement, coach Andy Reid and owner Clark Hunt accepted the Lamar Hunt Trophy — named after his father — emblematic of the AFC title.
 Next up: chasing the Vince Lombardi Trophy.
 As they had done in their past three “elimination’’ games, the sixth-seeded Titans (11-8) got started quickly. The difference at Arrowhead as opposed to Houston, New England and Baltimore was that the Chiefs had Mahomes, Tyreek Hill, Sammy Watkins and Damien Williams on offense, and a vastly upgraded defense from when they lost in last year’s AFC title game.
 A week after they overcame a 24-0 deficit against Houston, the Chiefs had to rally again.
 Down 10-0 and 17-7, Kansas City didn’t flinch, building a 35-17 lead while controlling the clock with a strong ground game. Naturally, Mahomes complemented that with sharp passing, spreading the ball on short and deep throws. The dagger came with a 60-yard completion to Watkins for the Chiefs’ 28th straight point midway in the final period.
 Mahomes thrust both arms in the air as the crowd sang “I Want To Dance With Somebody.’’
 That somebody will be either the 49ers or Packers in two weeks. They were deciding the NFC crown later Sunday in California.
 After taking a 3-0 lead on Greg Joseph’s first field goal — with Tennessee’s penchant for scoring in the red zone, he hadn’t been called upon in his previous four games with the team — the Titans got a huge break. Bashaud Breeland appeared to make a diving interception, but replay review showed the ball hitting the ground.
 Helped by consecutive offside penalties and a a fourth-down pass to Adam Humphries for his first career playoff reception, the Titans converted on, what else, Henry’s 4-yard run.

The 49ers roared out to a 27-0 lead after two quarters, but held off a furious Green Bay comeback that saw the Packers pull within 14. The comeback was sparked when Aaron Rodgers completed a 65-yard pass to Davante Adams about four minutes into the fourth quarter, leading to a touchdown a few plays later.

In light of the rising cases of abuse and accidents that stray kittens fall victim to, the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) India has undertaken a campaign to sterilise stray cats in Mumbai. Over 500 cats have been sterilised so far, said PETA officials.
 The initiative was started to prevent thousands of potential offspring of cats from being born into difficult lives on the streets, where they face danger on a daily basis. PETA has been focusing first on the areas where the cat population is dense, such as near fish markets, butcher shops and restaurants.

Despite freshman Adam Conquest’s first collegiate goals, No. 15 Bowling Green hockey failed to weather the storm against third-ranked Minnesota State Friday night in a 6-3 loss.
 When playing the nation’s third-best team, there is going to be almost no room for error. The Falcons saw first hand how simple mistakes can end with a puck in the back of their net.
 “They lead the country in goals against, so if they score five it is going to be really hard to beat them,” head coach Ty Eigner said.
