MARLBORUGH -- Amanda Bowen sat patiently in her car, waiting for her turn to be tested for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
 Bowen, 23, of Marlborough, joined dozens of parked cars along Highland Street on Monday morning in a queue as long as the eye could see, waiting to submit a saliva sample at Marlborough Hospital, one of several sites statewide offering the test.
 Gov. Charlie Baker gave the green light for the testing sites, and Marlborough is one of eight communities chosen because of higher rates of COVID-19.
 Bowen wanted peace of mind she's not carrying the virus, since she lives at home with her parents and siblings and doesn't want to run the risk of infecting them.
 Pat and Richard Roy of Maynard were parked directly behind Bowen.
 Their disabled daughter lives in a group home that recently started allowing visitors during the pandemic, and the Roys hope their saliva samples will come back negative, reassuring them they can visit their daughter without the possibility of compromising her health.
 Marlborough Hospital, part of the UMass Memorial Healthcare System, started offering the tests in drive-up fashion on Friday and will continue through Aug. 14. Hours are Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to noon.
 "We're thrilled to provide the service," said John Kelly, the hospital's chief operating officer.

 Friday, three of the 190 samples collected at the hospital were COVID-19 positive, and those cases were in patients who were on the younger side - 22, 24 and 42 years of age.
 Each sample is sent to the healthcare system's central laboratory in Worcester, where it takes about 16 hours to process, faster than nasal swab tests, and they're just as accurate, Kelly said. Patients are notified of the results within 24 to 48 hours.
 It's also a painless process, compared to swabs that are extended into the nostril until it reaches the nasopharynx, the portion of the airway where the nasal passage meets the throat.
 "They're very uncomfortable," Kelly said of nasal swabs, noting they can also generate coughing, gagging and sneezing, which could potentially spread COVID-19 droplets into the air.
 The amount of personal protective equipment worn by hospital staff is minimal during saliva sample collection, compared to a nasal swab. Generally, the only PPE needed is a face mask as a staff member gives each car one collection kit per passenger.
 Each kit contains a vile to collect three cubic centimeters of saliva, and cars drop off the tubes at the hospital's collection window.
 Online registration is currently unavailable. Every passenger in a car must also have an official form of personal identification to give a sample.
 The only caveat is no eating, drinking, smoking, gum chewing, tooth brushing, and using mouthwash at least 30 minutes before providing a sample.
 Non-Marlborough residents are welcome, and a hospital spokeswoman said she's seen license plates on cars in the queue from Rhode Island and Connecticut.
 Marlborough Hospital's emergency room continues to administer rapid nasal swab tests for patients arriving with various health challenges. Depending on the type of illness, intake personnel determine if a patient needs a COVID-19 test.
 Two swabs are administered in those situations, and if the first swab is negative, the second is sent off to the lab in Worcester to confirm the negative result.
 Negative results retested use a PCR system by Abbot ID that received emergency approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It identifies RNA and DNA to determine if there is a match with COVID-19.
 Another advantage of saliva samples is the current supply shortage of nasal swabs.
 "It's very difficult to get swabs," said Kathleen Luczyk, Marlborough Hospital's laboratory director, who noted the hospital's emergency department has a supply of only 80 swab tests per week.
 "We make it work," Kelly said.
 As for what lies ahead, Kelly said Massachusetts could extend saliva collection in the eight communities through the end of this year. If not, the "most realistic" scenario, according to Kelly, is testing outside hospitals for patients that display COVID-19 symptoms and for those told to get a test by a primary care physician.
 As we enter the fall and the traditional flu season, the weather gets colder, forcing more people to huddle inside. That could create an increased risk of contracting COVID-19, Kelly said.
 Diana and Bruce Channell also waited in the long line on Highland Street to submit a saliva sample. The Natick couple is hoping to get a negative result, because they own property in Maine. They want to go there, but Maine has a new law that says anyone visiting from out-of-state is allowed to skip a 14-day quarantine if they can present proof they've had a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours of arrival.
 The law is intended to protect Maine's summer tourism industry.
 "We want to do the right thing,' Diana Channell said, noting she also has elderly parents, so getting a saliva test will show if she and her husband are living without the virus.
 "I wish more communities were doing this (free saliva test)," said Diana Channel. "Everyone should get it done. Test, trace, and quarantine. Follow the science."

AMMAN — Unionists in the agriculture sector on Monday called on the government to facilitate the return of foreign agriculture workers to the Kingdom to protect the industry in the coming years.
 President of the Jordan Valley Farmers Union Adnan Khaddam told The Jordan Times said that the labour ministry "is working towards encouraging Jordanian labourers to take over from foreign labourers, which is harming the sector".
 "Many foreign labourers have left the Kingdom or have been ordered to leave when the situation changes and if they do, we will not have any crops next year," Khaddam said.
 President of the Agricultural Engineers Association (AEA) Abdelhadi Falahat also told The Jordan Times that the agriculture sector is "suffering from a crisis due to the shortage of foreign labourers".
 "We feel that the agriculture sector needs more support and attention from the government to resolve the problem of foreign workers, including those who have left the country," Falahat said.  
 The AEA president added that one of the most “practical and effective” solutions that the government could adopt is allowing foreign labourers who had left the country before the COVID-19 crisis to come back under strict health conditions.
 Meanwhile, Ministry of Labour Spokesperson Mohammad Zuod said that the agriculture sector is “a priority” for the ministry and "we are trying to keep the foreign agriculture workers in the Kingdom and facilitate their stay".
 "We have decreased the work permit fees of foreign workers from JD520 to JD320 and allowed foreign workers’ permits to be transferable so that they can fill the gaps in the agriculture industry," Zuod told The Jordan Times.
 Around 20,000 foreign workers have registered to leave the Kingdom through the ministry’s electronic platforms, according to Zuod.
 "The greatest challenge is that the health restrictions will not allow any foreign workers who leave the country to return for the time being and at the same time Jordanians do not like to work in the agriculture sector," Zuod added.
 On May 31, His Majesty King Abdullah called for stepping up efforts to develop local product specifications and quality, as well as expand the pharmaceutical, medical supplies and food processing industries to cover domestic needs and increase exports.
 At a meeting with the steering committee to support the national pharmaceutical, medical supplies and food processing industries at Al Husseiniya Palace, attended by HRH Crown Prince Hussein, King Abdullah urged identifying an entity to implement the expansion of these industries within a clear timeframe, according to a Royal Court statement.
 His Majesty noted the importance of identifying agricultural land in Jordan and the types of crops best suited for cultivation.
 The steering committee was formed by Royal directives in mid-April to expand local production of food, medicine and medical supplies.
 On May 10 during a visit to a farm project, King Abdullah stressed the importance of helping Jordanian farmers shift from traditional farming to value-added agricultural products and target export markets.
 King Abdullah, accompanied by the Crown Prince, commended entrepreneurial agricultural projects and their capacity to generate jobs, noting the importance of maintaining public safety procedures.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Two men and two teens have been charged in the death of rising rapper Pop Smoke who was killed during a Los Angeles home- invasion robbery in February, the district attorney’s office said Monday.Los Angeles District Attorney Jackie Lacey said in a statement that Corey Walker and Keandre Rodgers were charged with murder that occurred during the commission of a robbery and burglary. The two male juveniles were also charged with murder and robbery while in juvenile court.The 20-year-old New York rapper, whose legal name is Bashar Barakah Jackson, was killed Feb. 19 at a home in the Hollywood Hills. A 911 call from a friend of someone in the house reported armed intruders inside the home, police previously said.Walker, 19, and Rodgers, 18, face the death penalty or life in prison without the possibility of parole if convicted. Both are expected to be arraigned Monday.Jaquan Murphy, 21, was also arrested in connection to the incident last week. The complaint includes gang and gun allegations.Capt. Jonathan Tippet, who oversees the Los Angeles Police Department’s elite Robbery-Homicide Division, said three men and two teenage boys likely went to the home because they knew Pop Smoke was there from social media posts. They stole items from the home, though Tippet said he could not divulge what was taken.All five are believed to be members of a South Los Angeles gang, which Tippet would not name, and at least some of them are believed to be linked to a 2019 homicide when a fight escalated into a shooting outside the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.Authorities did not initially believe the rapper’s death was related to a robbery. The home where the shooting occurred is owned by Edwin Arroyave and his wife Teddi Mellencamp, a star of “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” and the daughter of Rock &amp; Roll Hall-of-Famer John Mellencamp.Teddi Mellencamp previously said on Instagram that the couple had been notified of the shooting at their rental property but knew no more than what they had seen in media reports.Pop Smoke arrived on the rap scene in 2018 and broke out with “Welcome to the Party” a gangsta anthem with boasts about shootings, killings and drugs that became a huge sensation, and prompted Nicki Minaj to drop a verse on a remix.Earlier this year, Pop Smoke released the mixtape “Meet the Woo 2,” which debuted at No. 7 on the Billboard Top 200 albums chart. It was the follow up to his first official release, “Meet the Woo.” The rapper also had the popular hit “Gatti” with Travis Scott and Jackboys and “Dior.”His major label debut album, “Shoot for the Stars Aim for the Moon,” was executive produced by 50 Cent. It was released posthumously July 3 to mostly positive reviews and features appearances from popular artists including Future, DaBaby and Quavo.Pop Smoke had been scheduled to start a U.S. tour in Washington, D.C., on March 2.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

LOUDONVILLE -- John Hill of Vermillion shared his four-part adventure of conquering the 2,200-mile Appalachian Trail with members of the Rotary Club of Loudonville at their meeting Thursday, July 9.  
 Hill is the membership chairman for Rotary District 6600, which comprises northwestern Ohio, including Loudonville. He said his love of hiking and backpacking started when he joined his son on camping adventures at the Philmont Boy Scout Ranch in New Mexico, first in 1995, and again in 2001.  
 From that, he was naturally attracted to the revered Appalachian Trail, which starts at Springer Mountain, in northern Georgia to Mount Katahdin, in the wilds of North Central Maine. The trail includes dramatic elevation changes as it crosses 300 mountains, from a high point at Clingman's Done in Tennessee, 6,625 feet, to a low point in a bog near New York City, 120 feet. The trail was immortalized by the book, "A Walk in the Woods," by Bill Bryson, and the subsequent film.  
 Hill did the trail in four segments, the first in 2011 at the urging of his daughter, which involved a stretch through the Berkshires in western Connecticut and Massachusetts, a brief but very pleasant journey in late September, just as the leaves were changing.  
 His next test was much bigger, about 550 miles starting at Springer Mountain, the traditional starting point.  
 "Actually, you can start anywhere, as the trail crosses 14 states, and it offers incredible beauty, including a number of endangered plants or animals.  
 Among the flora and fauna, he encountered were trilliums, mountain laurel, three bear cubs and a yearling, a seven-foot-long black snake, a coiled, but fortunately not striking rattlesnake, and wild ponies in Virginia "that harassed us more than any other animal."  
 While the hike was mostly in the mountainous wilds, Hill took several breaks along the way, stopping at small towns and sleeping in a motel bed, and sitting down and eating a real meal.  
 Food on the trail was varied and not bad. His favorite dish -- from an array that he carried in a backpack stuffed with 35 pounds of items -- was tuna fish mixed with Cheetos. Breaks at ice cream shops were cherished, and his peak culinary experience was gobbling down six Krispy Kreme doughnuts during a motel stop.  
 While staying clean on the trail was a challenge, Hill said he showered or bathed as much as he could, "in streams, lakes and rivers, with a bucket, or in a much-appreciated shower house."  
 And while he walked alone, he socialized with other hikers.  
 "It was easy to make friends," he said. "And I actually made friendships with two hiking buddies, guys who I walked for several weeks with along the way."  
 He also discovered the international attraction of the trail.  
 "I met hikers from China, Japan, Denmark, Sweden, Germany and Canada," he said.  
 Getting lost was an issue the whole way. "While the trail was pretty well marked with white blazes on the path, you could get confused," he said. "I made one wrong turn that led me astray for four miles before I discovered it."  
 "I referred to the trail in Pennsylvania as 'Rockelvania,' because it was entirely made of rock, and the last 100 miles of the trail, in Maine, was nothing but wilderness, the trail, water, bogs, mountains and mosquitoes. It took me eight days to walk that stretch."  
 Hill was within about 10 days of completing his conquest of the trail in 2016 when he was afflicted by an eye infection, and had to stop. He started again a year later, completing the trail by climbing 5,268-foot Mount Katahdin, on Sept. 22, 2017.  
 "My family joined me for the last leg of the trail, a gesture much appreciated," he said.  
 Hill called walking the trail "the most incredible, exciting and fulfilling thing I have ever done, and the most compelling thing about it was what I learned about myself, doing it with no one making me do it, and with no rules, supported only by God's support. He helped me a lot."

 The Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference, of which Franklin is a member, announced last week its schools will not begin the football season prior to Sept. 12.
 That means IWU's opener now will be Sept. 19 against Carroll at Tucci Stadium. The cancellation against Franklin leaves the Titans with nine games, all in the College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin.
 The CCIW is expected to update its fall sports participation status later this week.

MANSFIELD -- An Easton man surrendered to police early Sunday morning after allegedly holding up a Mansfield CVS at gunpoint Saturday night, according to Mansfield police.
 Matthew Sarnowitz, 37, of Easton, is facing armed robbery and associated charges as the investigation continues, police said.
 The CVS at 216 Chauncy St., which is open 24 hours, reported being robbed at gunpoint Saturday night, just before 12 a.m. The suspect was described as a white male in a hoodie, police said.
 The suspect was said to have fled into the woods behind the Mansfield Post Office on Giles Place.
 Mansfield officers arrived and coordinated with Foxboro and state police to set up a perimeter around the wooded area between Copeland Drive, Chauncy Street and Route 140, police said.
 Video confirmed a handgun had been shown to the clerk on duty at CVS and as a result of the large area to be searched and the high likelihood the suspect was there, resources from the Metropolitan Law Enforcement Council were requested including more K9 units and personnel to search the thick wooded area, according to police. Crisis negotiators were also requested.
 Mansfield officer Michael Fitzgerald and his K9 Ronan participated in the search.
 "He tracked him to a good location that helped confirm that he was still located in the wooded area," Mansfield Police Chief Ron Sellon said. "We called for more resources due to the firearm and having a good perimeter set to contain the scene and hopefully deescalate and get him to surrender (which he eventually did)."
 At 4 a.m., Sarnowitz came out of the woods, without a shirt or shoes, having apparently discarded them in the woods and was taken into custody without incident, police said.
 Police recovered cash taken from the robbery and clothing in the woods, police said.
 "We have not recovered the gun as of yet," Sellon said.
 "We want to thank our law enforcement partners at MetroLEC, Foxborough Police Department, Massachusetts State Police, and Southeastern Massachusetts Regional Emergency Communications Center for their assistance," Mansfield police stated on its Facebook page.

A Capri alla taverna “Anema e Core”, il rifugio abituale di vip e volti noti delle vacanze capresi, incontro tra Preziosi. L’attore Alessandro, caprese di fatto con villa a Occhio Marino e l’imprenditore Enrico patron della “Giochi Preziosi” e numero uno del Genoa calcio si sono ritrovati insieme a cantare nella taverna della musica live di Guido e Gianluigi Lembo. Ad esibirsi per primo è stato Alessandro che, insieme a Gianluigi Lembo, ha intonato i suoi brani del cuore, tra cui “Hit the road Jack” e “La Bamba”. Mise sportiva, con camicia e cappellino uno degli attori più belli (e bravi) dell’attuale panorama si è lasciato trasportare dal ritmo dell”Anema e Core” insieme a Gianluigi Lembo che indossava la sua t-shirt cult “Made in Anema e Core” ed il panama personalizzato con alcune celebri frasi delle canzoni di papà Guido. La “serata Preziosi” è proseguita, poi, con la performance canora di Enrico, il re dei giocattoli e numero uno del calcio genoano che ha intonato “Tutto il resto è noia”. E poi incontro a sorpresa tra i due Preziosi per una foto che entra di diritto nell’esclusiva galleria delle immagini…preziose della taverna “Anema e Core”.
