Buttigieg's audiobook is available for download now. In addition to the election, one of the other big things that Buttigieg is focused on is the addition of new Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett. President Trump has now appointed three Supreme Court Justices and the legal protection of gay marriage could be coming under the microscope again. Buttigieg was the first openly gay Democratic presidential candidate and is also married to his husband Chasten.

LONDON (AP) — A British judge will rule next week on whether Johnny Depp was libeled by a tabloid newspaper that branded him a wife-beater — an accusation his lawyer called a “reputation-destroying, career-ending” false allegation.Britain’s judicial office announced Tuesday that judge Andrew Nicol will deliver his verdict in writing on Nov. 2, without a hearing at the High Court, where Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard had a dramatic three-week legal showdown in July.The case, with its accusations of drug abuse, emotional turmoil and drunken fights, cast a stark light on the private lives of the celebrity couple, who met on the set of 2011 comedy “The Rum Diary” and married in Los Angeles in 2015. They separated the following year and divorced in 2017.“Pirates of the Caribbean” star Depp sued News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and the newspaper’s executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an April 2018 article that accused him of assaulting Heard.Over several days in the witness box, Depp, 57, branded the allegations a “hoax” and claimed Heard was the aggressor during their volatile relationship.“He has never hit a woman in his entire life — period, full stop, nada,” Depp’s lawyer David Sherborne said in closing arguments.Heard, 34, testified as the main witness for the defense, saying Depp turned violent under the influence of alcohol and drugs. She alleged 14 separate incidents between 2013 and 2016 in which he hit, slapped and shoved her, pulled her hair and threw bottles at her “like grenades.”“I didn’t want to do this, I did not want to expose this totality of what really happened to me,” Heard said in court. “I didn’t want to talk about everything that happened in our marriage and happened in our relationship.”The Sun’s lawyer, Sasha Wass, said in her summing up that there was no doubt Depp “regularly and systematically abused his wife.”But Depp’s lawyers accused Heard of fabricating evidence, calling her an unreliable witness and “a compulsive liar.”Whatever way the judge rules, it’s unlikely to be the end of the legal drama. Depp is also suing Heard for $50 million in Virginia over a Washington Post story about domestic violence. The trial is due to be held next year.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

 # Renewable energy on campus | Our Turn
 David Masur and Mark H. Erickson
 From recurring hurricanes along the Gulf Coast to wildfires out west to extreme heat and torrential downfalls right here in Pennsylvania, this past summer was a stark reminder of the impact that can be done by climate change.
 But a recent report by the PennEnvironment Research and Policy Center, America’s Top Colleges for Renewable Energy 2020, showed that Pennsylvania's colleges and universities are leading the charge to implement solutions to reduce their carbon footprint and help reduce impact on the environment.
 Eight Pennsylvania schools were highlighted in the report for leading the nation when it comes to adopting clean, renewable energy and promoting electric vehicle technology. The schools featured in the report for their leadership in renewable energy adoption represent every corner of the state, big schools and small, and everything from community colleges to private liberal art schools. They include Swarthmore College, Chatham University, Carnegie Mellon University, Susquehanna University, Allegheny College, Bryn Mawr College, Lebanon Valley College, and, in the Lehigh Valley, Northampton Community College.
 NCC was recognized for supplying 100% of its electricity with renewable energy. The college’s Monroe campus includes LEED Gold and net-zero energy buildings, helping demonstrate to the local community and other higher education institutions what it means to promote sustainability.
 Northampton Community College isn’t the only Pennsylvania institution stepping up to bat on renewable energy. Six colleges and universities in the state are getting 100 percent of their electricity from renewable sources, while others are adopting electric vehicle technology within their fleets and using renewables to meet their on-campus non-electric energy needs like heating, cooling, and hot water.
 These colleges and universities have an important role to play in the much- needed transition to clean, renewable energy. They have also helped us understand impacts of non-renewable energy on our planet, while their research and innovation has helped advance the solutions -- from wind and solar energy technologies to policies that best encourage their adoption. Now they’re leading an effort to demonstrate how all that knowledge and innovation can be put to good use right on their own campuses.
 There are also untold examples of colleges and universities educating and inspiring future engineers, policy makers and activists who will lead the transition towards 100 percent renewable energy going forward. And, perhaps most importantly, colleges and universities are often some of the most influential institutions in their communities. As one of the largest community college consumers of green power in the nation, NCC’s actions are motivating peer institutions to follow suit, and also bolstering green leadership in the state and region.
 This leadership is critical, not just in setting a path to a renewable energy future, but also in drastically lowering air pollution emissions today. College and university campuses are big energy users, so when they go renewable, it makes a tangible impact. There are over 5,000 colleges and universities in the U.S., which collectively serve more than 20 million students and spend $14 billion annually on energy. By transitioning to clean and renewable energy sources that don’t pollute or negatively impact the environment, campuses can do their part to support a healthier future for us all.
 We all know the current academic year is bringing unique challenges for campuses across the country, but it’s just as important as ever that our institutions of higher learning continue to set an example for our communities -- and our state and nation to follow.
 It’s exciting to see Pennsylvania schools continue to lead the way toward the clean energy future that we all want and need. We owe it to our students, communities, the planet and to future generations.
