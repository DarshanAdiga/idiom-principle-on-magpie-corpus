A Republican member of the Wisconsin Elections Commission advised a Green Party representative about who to hire as an attorney after its presidential nominee was denied ballot access in the key battleground state, records obtained by The Associated Press show.


  The elections commission deadlocked 3-3 Aug. 20 on whether to put Green Party presidential candidate Howie Hawkins on the ballot. All three Republicans were in favor, while all three Democrats were against. Hawkins asked the Wisconsin Supreme Court to put him on, but the court in a 4-3 ruling Monday rejected that request. The court also lifted an order it issued last week pausing the mailing of absentee ballots while it considered the challenge.

So-called white nationalists therefore appear to be the preferred enemies of progressive Jews, requiring one to close ranks even – or perhaps especially – when Palestinians are being brutalized. Joe Biden does not venture into that extreme-think zone, but he has made his loyalties clear. He has said that “You don’t have to be Jewish to be a Zionist. I am a Zionist.” More recently he has denounced Trump as “bad for Israel.” And to demonstrate his _bona fides_ , he kicked Democratic Party Palestinian-activist Linda Sarsour under the bus when she appeared on a DNC convention panel discussing how to appeal to Muslim voters. Biden’s campaign office issued a statement saying that he “… has been a strong supporter of Israel and a vehement opponent of anti-Semitism his entire life, and he obviously condemns her views and opposes BDS, as does the Democratic platform. She has no role in the Biden campaign whatsoever.”

Going through the gears in Sport mode is rougher than in Normal mode, but it does the trick in getting the Edge up to speed while making it feel like a sportier sedan. Like its other ST branded siblings, the Edge ST comes with standard torque vectoring which greatly increases the handling when entering corners at speed. The reworked suspension does an admirable job of keeping it flat all through the bends especially for such a high-sided vehicle and keeps the vehicle fairly well balanced under heavy braking. The steering is crisp and precise and does a good job of transmitting what the front wheels are doing.

Seven years ago, NBC Sports released a very funny sketch starring Jason Sudeikis as an American football coach named Ted Lasso who manages to get hired as the manager of Tottenham, one of the top soccer clubs in England’s Premier League, which is one of the best leagues in the world. The comedy is the culture clash—a shouting alpha male with a southern accent trying to figure out a totally unfamiliar sport in a strange place, too stubborn to adapt and bringing all the wrong lessons over from America. As soccer becomes more familiar in the U.S., that sketch becomes increasingly quaint, since even your average deep-south gridiron jock knows more and more all the time about the world’s most popular sport. Which makes the premise of _Ted Lasso_ the 2020 TV show questionable; can you really translate a premise that’s thin in the first place, and extend it to a ten-episode season even as soccer becomes less and less exotic to us all the time?

Wisconsin Supreme Court denies Green Party presidential candidate ballot access

Phillips did not immediately return messages seeking comment Tuesday.


  Spindell said Tuesday that he had no regrets about reaching out to the Green Party and suggesting attorneys for them to hire. He said he felt he had done nothing wrong and that it was an "injustice" for the commission to keep Hawkins off the ballot.


  "If I think some of the decisions on the Elections Commission are wrong, I'm not going to keep my mouth shut," Spindell said. "I'm going to tell people about it. I think it's my obligation to the citizens of Wisconsin to do that."


  Spindell, in his email to Zeese, requested more information about the issue that kept Hawkins off the ballot in Wisconsin — the address put on nomination papers by his vice presidential candidate Angela Walker. He asked whether Walker lived at one of the addresses and if so when she had moved from the other address.

The ST comes with two drive modes Normal and Sport. By pressing the Sport button in the gear shift dial it wakes up the ST. The handling becomes tighter with gear shifts becoming quicker and more aggressive, the engine growl is artificially enhanced in the cabin by using the speakers system but manages to match the feel of the ST during acceleration. The edge is no lightweight but the V6 engine manages to get it up to 100km/h in around six seconds which is a huge improvement from its non-ST branded brethren.

Biden also worked for President Barack Obama and was a colleague in office of Hillary Clinton. Both did the usual pander to Israel and neither was particularly well disposed to the Palestinians, though Obama talked the talk of a man of peace so effectively that he was awarded a Nobel Prize. Bear in mind that Obama personally disliked Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but he increased the money from the U.S. Treasury going directly to Israel to $3.8 billion per annum and guaranteed it for ten years, an unprecedented move. The fact is that money was and is illegal under American law due to the 1976 Symington Amendment, which banned any aid to any country with a nuclear program that was not declared and subject to inspection under the terms of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Obama, who claims to be a “constitutional lawyer,” surely was aware of that but rewarded Israel anyway.

Behind the scenes, a group of principals is upset over the petition, which was not put to a vote. It was presented as a done deal, and members were asked to drum up support for the petition in their circles. The petition, one principal said, “does not prioritize the best interest of students. Instead, this act of cowardice places blame on one individual and does not place accountability on us — the managers of our own school communities — the principals.”
 The principal, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution, said they believe Hite has made some missteps, but generally, they support him, and “right now, I don’t want anything to take away from my kids getting a great virtual education.”
 The timing of the petition, on the eve of principals reporting back to school buildings after months of working from home, was also a worry, the principal said. Cooper said the district was needlessly risking principals' health by requiring them to work from buildings not yet ready for students, during a pandemic.
 “Gratitude should be expressed for our jobs instead of concerns being brought up about re-entering our buildings," the principal said.
