CHARLESTON, W.Va. (WOWK) - It's only day two of the legislative session and controversy is already brewing. For several months, the LGBTQ community has been working with lawmakers on a bill called the "Fairness Act." Previously, it seemed the legislative leadership could be on board, but today, Senate President Mitch Carmichael said he doesn't think it's the right path for West Virginia.

Torna a colpire la banda dei  distributori di benzina. Ad essere preso di mira e stato, per la seconda volta nel giro di poche settimane, il distributore Q8 di contrada Madonna dell'aiuto, sullo scorrimento 122 per Caltanissetta. Il colpo e stato messo a segno mercoledi , nel tardo pomeriggio. Tre  malviventi, a volto coperto, si sono fermati all'interno dell'area di servizio a bordo di una Fiat Uno, rubata pochi minuti prima a Canicatti , ed  hanno minacciato con un coltello e un fucile l'impiegato addetto alle pompe di distribuzione che e stato costretto a consegnare tutto l'incasso della giornata, circa mille euro. I banditi pero non si sono accontentati, sul posto erano presenti due corrieri che stavano effettuando il rifornimento di carburante ai loro mezzi, anche a loro e stato intimato di consegnare  i contanti posseduti e alcuni pacchi , per un totale di circa 1.300 euro. Portato a termine il colpo, i tre sono saltati a bordo dell'autovettura facendo perdere le loro tracce nel giro di pochi minuti. L'auto usata per il colpo e stata ritrovata completamente bruciata nella campagne dell'hinterland canicattinese. Le forze dell'ordine, nonostante il tempestivo intervento, non  sono riusciti a  rintracciare i malviventi. Gli inquirenti del  commissariato stanno indagando sull'accaduto.

But the whole reason to look at the average in the first place is to tap into a "wisdom of crowds" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes — much like with guessing the number of jelly beans in a jar, where the average guess tends to be very close. And so with DCPH trading so far above that average target price of $59.11/share, the -5.42% downside to that average target does seem to be a paradox against the bullish analyst ratings. Might analysts be behind the curve with their targets and upward adjustments are forthcoming? Or, is it time for some of these analysts to turn bearish and downgrade on valuation? One thing is for sure: this apparent paradox makes for a good "signal" to investors in DCPH to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding whether analysts have it right with their sentiment, or have it right with their price target for Deciphera Pharmaceuticals Inc.

You've probably heard of the expression that 80% of a company's revenue comes from 20% of its customers. It's generally a good rule of thumb and one of the many reasons why companies invest so much of their time and money increasing business from existing customers. Reward systems, memberships, and subscription models are all techniques that support this business model. ITW's strategy takes it a step further through a principle it calls "80/20 enabled." According to the company, they "draw deep insights from our key customer relationships, and then focus our efforts on designing and patenting new products and components that solve their specific challenges." It's a mindset that seems to be working, as ITW has amassed around 20,000 patents in total.

For example, imagine you're entitled to a monthly benefit of $1,600 at an FRA of 66. Waiting until age 70 to file will boost that benefit to $2,112, but you'll miss out on four years of payments. If you live until 82 1/2, you'll break even under both filing scenarios, coming away with a lifetime total of $316,800, regardless of whether you claim benefits at 66 versus 70. But once you live past 82 1/2, you start to come out ahead financially by waiting. And if you pass away even slightly before 82 1/2, you lose out on money by waiting. Therefore, see how your health stacks up before making your choice.

Konami Gaming, a slot machine maker, wants to weave facial recognition into its one-armed bandits. During a visit to its Las Vegas headquarters to hear more about its plans, I quickly discovered what the world would be like if facial recognition is everywhere.
 "Hello, Alfred," said a measured, robotic voice, startling me. It came from a kiosk called "Biometrics Welcome Console" positioned right next to the door of the conference room where my meeting was held. The kiosk knew who I was because Konami had set up a profile for me, using a public photo from my CNET bio without telling me. The facial recognition tagged me before I'd even said hello to the Konami team members in the room.
 I looked at the screen showing the photo the kiosk took of me when I walked in. The camera had caught just my eyes and nose. Still, the facial recognition software calculated it detected me with 60.5% accuracy.
 "Any picture you use online can be used to identify you already," Sina Miri, Konami's vice president of innovation and strategic research and design, told me. Konami had also set up profiles of my colleagues at the visit, again without telling them.

Tehran, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 10th Jan, 2020 ) :Iran's civil aviation chief denied Friday that a missile downed a Ukrainian airliner which crashed killing all 176 on board, dismissing claims of a catastrophic mistake by Tehran's air defences.
 The declaration came as Tehran faced mounting international pressure to allow a "credible" investigation into the crash, which Britain and Canada suggested was caused by an accidental missile strike.
 "One thing is for certain, this airplane was not hit by a missile," Iran's civil aviation chief Ali Abedzadeh said.
 The Boeing 737 crashed on Wednesday shortly after Tehran launched missiles at US forces in Iraq in response to the killing of a top Iranian general in a US drone strike in Baghdad.
 It is Iran's worst civil aviation disaster since 1988 when the US military said it shot down an Iran Air plane over the Gulf by mistake, killing all 290 people on board.
 The majority of the passengers on Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 were dual national Iranian-Canadians but they also included Ukrainians, Afghans, Britons and Swedes.

“I never lost that dream to be a police officer,” Farrelly said. “It’s hard to say why, people say it’s a calling and it really is. You get the answer of wanting to help people, and there is that, but it was a calling to me and something I always wanted to do.”
 When he was 25, Farrelly’s mother called him to tell him she’d discovered a letter written to him by the police chief in Wilmington, Delaware, who responded to him for an eighth grade project.
 “She found the letter, I was at a point in my life where I wasn’t happy where I was working, and I lost focus of where I wanted to go in life,” he added. “The timing was perfect. I was like — that’s it, it’s a sign and I started looking into the police academy.”
 Farrelly was hired at Mt. Sterling Police Department in 2003, worked there for a couple years before doing security work. He was then hired to the Circleville Police Department and has worked there, in many different roles, including jail administrator, school resource officer, patrolman and more.
 “This is always where I’ve wanted to be,” Farrelly stated. “From 1993, when I moved to Ohio, I’ve lived here. Circleville is my city and I’ve always wanted to be a Circleville Police Officer and now I’ve been here 13 years.”
 Farrelly said he’s proud to work in the community and that he feels like he’s starting to make more of a difference.
 “You get satisfaction when you have someone tell you thank you for helping them,” he said. “That’s not why I do it but you do get that satisfaction.”
 Farrelly said his favorite part of the job is the constant learning and challenge that the job has.
 “You never know what the next day is going to bring,” he told _The Circleville Herald_. “I love being challenged to where you have to think outside the box or solve a problem. That’s every day with law enforcement. There’s something new that you have to figure out and come up with an answer or a solution. Every day is different and you have no clue what it’ll bring.”
 Farrelly also talked about the brotherhood and family atmosphere that being in law enforcement brings.
 “These people will have my back in anything, on duty, at the station or off duty,” he continued. “I’ve helped people put up fences, I’ve helped people move. It’s truly a family. To have a Monday through Friday job you have people that are your friends but it’s not the same as in law enforcement. If I have an issue I can talk to Doug Davis and talk through a problem as a brother, not just a co-worker.”
 Farrelly said many times they’re dealing with people who are at their worst due to losing a loved one.
 “We’ve got to be their support but also figure out what happened,” Farrelly remarked. “At times I feel cold-hearted because I didn’t shed a tear when their family lost their child. I can’t because if I get my emotions involved I can’t solve it.”

India has deployed its aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya in the Arabian Sea at a time China and Pakistan are holding a nine-day mega naval exercise in the region, a move seen as New Delhi sending a clear signal to its two neighbours. Top officials of the Naval headquarters were on board the aircraft carrier when it was deployed in the strategic mission earlier this week, military sources told PTI.Pakistan and China on Monday launched a major drill in the North Arabian Sea with an aim to increase inter-operability and strategic cooperation between their two navies. The exercise Sea Guardians is taking place in the midst of heightened tension between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir issue. Key platforms of both China and Pakistan, including submarines, destroyers and frigates, are part of the exercise.Aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya, with MiG29K fighters on board, has been sent with a strategic objective, the sources said without elaborating. A Navy spokesperson said Deputy Chief of Naval Staff M S Pawar reviewed INS Vikramadityas operations in the Arabian Sea.The deputy chief was extremely pleased to witness the intense air operations with high levels of motivation and will to win that were evident on-board the Queen of the Battle, the spokesperson said. He expressed confidence that INS Vikramaditya will live up to the name and remain victorious in battle - always, the spokesperson added.China has been expanding its presence in the North Arabian Sea and is developing Pakistans deep water Gwadar port in the region. Gwadar is being connected through the over USD 60 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC to Chinas Xinjiang province, providing a key land route to China to access the warm waters of Arabian Sea.The Arabian Sea provides entry to the Indian Ocean where China has built a logistics base at Djibouti in the Horn of Africa. In September, the Indian Navy drove out a Chinese PLA ship from Indias Exclusive Economic Zone and had warned that such activities will be dealt with sternly.The INS Vikramaditya, commissioned into the Indian Navy in November 2013, is considered one of the top rated aircraft carriers globally. The Russian-origin ship is often called a floating airfield. The 44,500 tonne is about 284-m-long and its height is around 60 m, which is like a 20 storeyed building from keel to the highest point.The ship has a total of 22 decks and it has the ability to carry over 30 aircraft comprising an assortment of MiG 29KSea Harrier, Kamov 31, Kamov 28, Sea King, ALH-Dhruv and Chetak helicopters.

It clearly violated Section 10 by imitating the trademark and packaging material of the complainant.
 Similarly, the bench also found Karachi Nimco of violating Section 10 by using the word "NIMCO" in its branding and also copying the firm name and packaging of Nimco Corner.
 While rejecting the objections raised by Karachi Nimco's counsel, the bench held that under Section 59 of the Competition Act, the Act shall have an overriding effect on any other law for the time being in force, which inter alia includes the Trademark Ordinance.
 The CCP's order noted that during inquiry as well as proceedings before the Commission, the two companies have admitted the use of M/s Nimco Corner trademark and trade dress and instead of correcting their behaviour were justifying their conduct by raising misplaced and unsubstantiated submissions.
 The CCP imposed a penalty of Rs 25 million on Mr. Nimko Corner and Rs 20 million on Karachi Nimco for violating Section 10 of the Competition Act and directed the companies to cease and desist from the use of word "NIMCO", trademark, trade dress and packaging material similar to that of the M/s Nimco Corner. The two companies were also directed to repackage their products to distinguish them from the products of M/s Nimco Corner.
 The CCP is mandated under the Competition Act to ensure free competition in all spheres of commercial and economic activity, to ensure economic efficiency and to protect consumers from anti-competitive practices indulging deceptive marketing.

 American, British and Canadian officials say intelligence sources indicate that Iran shot down the plane, perhaps unintentionally, but this has been denied by Tehran.
 "President Volodymyr Zelensky and I met with US representatives," Prystaiko said on Twitter. "We have received important data which will be processed by our experts."
 Zelensky was due to speak to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the crash at 15:00, the minister added.
 "The version of a missile is not ruled out, but it has not yet been confirmed," Zelensky said on his Facebook page.
 He asked for Ukraine to be given all the information needed to conduct a thorough investigation.
 "Our goal is to establish the undeniable truth," he said. "The value of human life is above all political motives."
 Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine's national security and defence council, said Thursday that investigators were pursuing several leads, including a strike with a surface-to-air missile such as a Russian-made Tor, a collision with a drone, engine failure or a terror attack.
 Russia's Interstate Aviation Committee, which investigates aircraft incidents, said Friday that it was ready to assist in the probe but that Iran had not asked Moscow for help

India has deployed its aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya in the Arabian Sea at a time China and Pakistan are holding a nine-day mega naval exercise in the region, a move seen as New Delhi sending a clear signal to its two neighbours. Top officials of the Naval headquarters were on board the aircraft carrier when it was deployed in the strategic mission earlier this week, military sources told PTI.
 Pakistan and China on Monday launched a major drill in the North Arabian Sea with an aim to increase inter-operability and strategic cooperation between their two navies. The exercise 'Sea Guardians' is taking place in the midst of heightened tension between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir issue. Key platforms of both China and Pakistan, including submarines, destroyers and frigates, are part of the exercise.
 Aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya, with MiG29K fighters on board, has been sent with a strategic objective, the sources said without elaborating. A Navy spokesperson said Deputy Chief of Naval Staff M S Pawar reviewed INS Vikramaditya's operations in the Arabian Sea.
 The deputy chief was extremely pleased to witness the "intense air operations" with high levels of motivation and will to win that were evident on-board the "Queen of the Battle", the spokesperson said. He expressed confidence that INS Vikramaditya will "live up to the name and remain victorious in battle - always", the spokesperson added.
 China has been expanding its presence in the North Arabian Sea and is developing Pakistan's deep water Gwadar port in the region. Gwadar is being connected through the over USD 60 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to China's Xinjiang province, providing a key land route to China to access the warm waters of Arabian Sea.
 The Arabian Sea provides entry to the Indian Ocean where China has built a logistics base at Djibouti in the Horn of Africa. In September, the Indian Navy drove out a Chinese PLA ship from India's Exclusive Economic Zone and had warned that such activities will be dealt with sternly.
 The INS Vikramaditya, commissioned into the Indian Navy in November 2013, is considered one of the top rated aircraft carriers globally. The Russian-origin ship is often called a floating airfield. The 44,500 tonne is about 284-m-long and its height is around 60 m, which is like a 20 storeyed building from keel to the highest point.
 The ship has a total of 22 decks and it has the ability to carry over 30 aircraft comprising an assortment of MiG 29K/Sea Harrier, Kamov 31, Kamov 28, Sea King, ALH-Dhruv and Chetak helicopters.

But I say this without a trace of contempt.On the contrary, this is a meaningful, well-developed design philosophy: to ride a player on a roller coaster made in Hellenistic scenery and with as many dead loops as possible.

Perhaps your resolution isn't a true priority. I mean really. If you sit down and take stock of what's happening in your life, what changes would actually improve your happiness _every day?_ It's funny how often we choose resolutions that won't really change our day-to-day joy. Ultimately, as busy as we are, we will always prioritize activities and changes that we'll actually _feel_ the difference of on a regular basis. Thing like, "I'll wash my car more" or "I'll only buy organic" just don't fall under that category.

It's not about the zombie collective farmers and Spanish dwarfs - it's about the changed gameplay formula. This is not just a continuation in a new vein or a fresh start. This is generally another game in which familiar motives are constantly guessed.
