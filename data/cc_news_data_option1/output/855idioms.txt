Opening on Monday, 30 March, the Stations of the cross art exhibition seeks to bring the Easter narrative to the public sphere every year so that people can live it out.      Rev. Doug Purcell is a Uniting Church minister and an artist in his own right, with works featured in galleries across the state. Since 2007, he has been responsible for curating the Stations of the Cross. He told _Insights_ that the event, “is not about getting bums on seats in one particular congregation.”      “It is about keeping the Christian narrative alive in a culture that has become increasingly negative to the church and its story,” Rev. Purcell said.      “It is about offering a resource to the wider church and community whereby people might ‘walk the way of the cross’ in a reflective manner that enriches their life and being.  For me, when congregations come and walk together and talk together, their being communities of faith people or Jesus followers is strengthened.”

You may have already heard about Valorant as Project A, a title that Riot Games has been teasing work on for a few years. _Recent leaks_ gave us a better look at the game's approach to the online shooting formula, and it looks like that early info was legit. Valorant is a fast-paced, tactical shooter that will be immediately familiar to Counter-Strike fans with the addition of special abilities that feel more like Overwatch. Check out the first official gameplay trailer to see what I mean.
 The match starts with players purchasing their loadout in a Counter-Strike style selection screen, then positioning themselves around a map to defend points in the usual Bomb Defusal mode style.
 If the player characters didn't throw out glowing magic orbs and summon colorful rifts of toxic gas every now and then a casual observer might not be able to tell it apart from Counter-Strike GO. It looks like Riot Games wants gunplay to be the deciding factor of Valorant battles, with special powers mostly being used to get the upper hand on opponents.
 Before it even mentions the cool powers and guns, Valorant's _official site_ talks about how Riot Games is trying to make Valorant a smooth, responsive experience for all players: "128-tick servers, at least 30 frames per second on most min-spec computers (even dating back a decade), 60 to 144 FPS on modern gaming rigs, a global spread of datacenters aimed at <35ms for players in major cities around the world, a netcode we’ve been obsessing over for years, and a commitment to anti-cheat from day one."
 Riot says Valorant will debut in Summer 2020, though we don't yet know if that will come in the form of a limited beta or a full-scale release. We'll keep an eye on Valorant's progress and let you know when we hear more.

After the current management stepped in, it scrubbed through the backlog and booked $714 mn in pre-tax charges across business segments in Q2 2019. This clearly is a case of aggressive estimates/financial projections gone wrong across the board rather than execution issues on a couple of projects.
 What remains after taking these charges is projects at break-even margin in backlog which the company has to deliver to clients. If there is even a slight execution issue or externalities, these projects can easily go into losses and the company has to take further charges. For example, if coronavirus pandemic gets worse and Fluor has to take some downtime, some of these projects can easily turn red.
 Further, the question still remains if new management has reassessed all the project estimates and if it was conservative enough. Given what previous management and other companies have done, there seems to be quite a leeway in terms of estimating the cost to complete projects. Even after taking huge charges in Q2 2019, management is still examining projects for more charges. In its recent earnings call, management talked about potential charges in two big projects. While it has declined to provide more details saying its books are still open and we will probably know about these charges when the company files its 10-K, I believe this signals there might be more pain ahead.
 Management also has a reason to not be conservative. These are not normal times for Fluor. After taking charges in Q2, in addition to reversing previous profits, the company will have to incur $500 mn additional cash expense in 2020 and 2021 to complete the problem projects. Things are already not going well for Fluor and more charges would have added more questions to the viability of its business. So, if management has some leeway in terms of its profitability estimates, there is a chance that it would not have gone conservative enough in taking these charges.
 It seems like Fluor's fixed-price contracts really have a bad reputation in the market. Last year, when the company kept its government business on the block (before reversing the decision last month), it excluded two troubled fixed price projects: Radford and Warren. I believe investors would not have been comfortable with the forecast of these two projects and worries regarding any further charges would have turned off the potential bidders.

 No. 5 Centennial in the semifinal round. How do you feel about that draw?One thing I’ve learned to do is expect the unexpected. I had no rhyme or reason in even talking with some other people in the coaching industry. A lot of them are miffed by how it went down as well. At the end of the day, you’ve got to play whoever’s in front of you. I’ve accepted that, and we’re going to prepare for whoever we have to play.Has the seeding lit a fire under your guys?Oh, absolutely. I think more than anything we’re motivated to play and to play better. I don’t think we really finished the (regular) season the way we had intended, and they’re amped up to get back on the floor, to really show that they’re that team that can play great basketball.What does it mean to be in a position where you can discuss a regional repeat?Man, it’s really a blessing, and I think it’s just a tribute to the hard work these boys have put in. ... I’m so excited because our five seniors ... academically are stellar. I don’t think anybody’s got less than a B-plus. We’re celebrating Black History Month, and I think this is something we can celebrate.You talk about those five seniors and their impact — what do you feel these last two teams’ accomplishments can do for the future of Urbana basketball?What we’ve done, we’ve just set the bar. There’s no ambiguity in terms of what the expectation is. People are aware that if you come to Urbana, you’re going to be challenged every day. ... That’s the expectation now is, “Hey, this is what we’re signing up for.”Even though Urbana is a rival of Centennial and Champaign Central, what does it mean to see all three programs doing well?I love it because, even though I’m the varsity basketball coach at Urbana, I work at Champaign schools. ... My sons played at Central, so I’m always going to have a heart and a fondness for Central.

Bank Danamon completed the divestment of its 70% stake in insurance company, Adira Insurance, in end-November 2019. At the company's FY2019 earnings call on February 19, 2020, Bank Danamon highlighted that "we may increase the return to our shareholder some of the capital gain (from the divestment of the equity interest in Adira Insurance)", and that could potentially imply higher dividends for FY2020.
 The bank paid out a dividend per share of IDR143.22 for FY2018, and FY2019 dividends are likely to be announced in end-March 2020. If Bank Danamon maintains its 35% dividend payout ratio in FY2019 (IDR132 in dividends per share), this would imply a dividend yield of 4.2% for the bank. Assuming Bank Danamon increases its dividend payout ratio for FY2019 to 40% (IDR151 in dividends per share) as a partial return of the divestment gain associated with Adira Insurance to shareholders, Bank Danamon's FY2019 dividend yield rises to 4.8%.
 In the medium to long term, Bank Danamon could also potentially increase its dividend payout, given its strong capital position. Bank Danamon's CAR or Capital Adequacy Ratio was 24.2% as of end-FY2019, and its LLC or Loan Loss Coverage ratio was at a healthy 112.6%.
 Market consensus expects Bank Danamon to further increase its dividends per share to IDR164 and IDR168 for FY2020 and FY2021 respectively. This implies forward FY2020 and FY2021 dividend yields of 5.2% and 5.3% respectively for Bank Danamon.
 Secondly, an overhang for Bank Danamon regarding free float requirements will eventually be removed.
 Japan's MUFG became Bank Danamon's single largest controlling shareholder in May 2019 with a 94.1% equity stake, and Bank Danamon has to increase its public free float from 5.9% currently to 7.5% by mid-2021 to comply with regulatory requirements.
 The market is concerned about a potential sell-down in Bank Danamon's shares sometime down the road, due to either MUFG offloading part of its shares or the bank doing a share placement that could potentially dilute the interests of existing shareholders.

The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK continues to rise, but Boris Johnson says the country is ready to fight the outbreak. Tradefair brings you the latest from UK politics... Boris Johnson has said the UK and the NHS are well prepared to handle the coronavirus outbreak, after the number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 across the country rose to 36. The prime minister waited until today (Monday March 2) to chair a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee, amid criticism of his response to the virus outbreak. Financial markets last week felt the effects of growing anxiety around a potential coronavirus pandemic, with stocks witnessing their worst week since the 2008 financial crisis. This morning, however, London's FTSE 100 rebounded as the Bank of England pledged to protect the UK economy. Battle plan A statement from 10 Downing Street confirmed the prime minister will chair a Cobra meeting today, bringing together senior ministers, the UK's chief medical officer and the chief scientific advisor to devise a "battle plan" containing a "detailed set of countermeasures" to handle the outbreak. Johnson will tell the meeting there is now "little doubt" that the spread of Covid-19 will present a "significant challenge" for the country. "But we are well prepared, and the government and the NHS will stop at nothing to fight this virus," he will add. "This battle plan lays out in detail the measures we could use - if and when they are needed." In a veiled response to those who have criticised the prime minister and the government for the speed of their response to the coronavirus situation, Downing Street said Cobra has been "meeting regularly" to discuss this issue since January and will come together "as often as needed". Paul Cosford, medical director at Public Health England, has said widespread transmission of coronavirus in the UK is now "highly likely" and the country must be prepared. His comments came after 13 more people were diagnosed with the virus yesterday, including the first patient in Scotland, meaning the spread has now reached all four parts of the UK. 'Part- time prime minister' Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, called on the government to give a full explanation of the emergency powers it's planning to use in response to the outbreak. He urged the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to address the House of Commons today to give an update on the government's proposed measures so MPs can scrutinise them. "There are growing concerns about our part-time prime minister's handling of the coronavirus outbreak and serious questions about capacity in our overstretched NHS," Mr Ashworth said. Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran wrote to the health secretary to call for assurances that people who are forced to self-isolate will be paid. The GMB union, meanwhile, said NHS trusts should ensure that outsourced staff receive sick pay in suspected cases of Covid-19. Approximately 86,000 people in more than 50 countries around the world have contracted the virus, with more than 3,000 patients dying. Stock markets suffer Escalating concern over the economic impact of the outbreak took its toll on financial markets last week, with the FTSE 100 plunging by more than 11% over the course of the week. Around £200 billion was wiped off the value of shares in London. Monday morning brought slightly better fortunes for the UK's blue chip index, which enjoyed an early surge of more than 2.5% before falling away over the course of morning trading. The market was buoyed by pledges from the Bank of England and other national banks that measures would be taken to protect economies from the worst effects of coronavirus. A spokesperson for the central bank said it was working closely with the Treasury, the Financial Conduct Authority and international partners to ensure "all necessary steps" are taken to "protect financial and monetary stability". Elsewhere, Wall Street's Dow Jones Industrial Average was down by more than 12% last week, while Germany's DAX index fell by the same amount. Shanghai's SSE Composite Index dropped by more than 5% last week but clawed back 3% today.
