As a quick refresher, "sound bath" or "sound meditation" describes the mindful practice of listening to sound that facilitates relaxation and repair in the body. The frequency of commonly used instruments in sound baths (think tuning forks, gongs, chimes, etc.) have been shown to help guide the brain into a more subdued and receptive theta state.
 In addition to calming us down, Auster says sound baths help us become more attuned and understanding listeners. "Sound and listening go hand in hand," she explains. "The whole experience becomes about the sound itself but also how we're relating to the sounds."
 Group sound baths have been rising in popularity for years, but you can also do the practice from home. And what better opportunity to get started than during the clang and clatter of the holidays? Taking a digital sound bath is as simple as sitting or lying down in a comfortable position, closing your eyes, and pressing play on a sound bath recording. (There are plenty of them online, and Auster was nice enough to share one of her own at the bottom of this post.) You'll want to make sure that you can hear the nuances of the recording, so using headphones or a high-quality speaker is recommended—but your phone works in a pinch. Listen for as long as your schedule allows throughout this busy season.
 "What I would recommend is just trying to access as many of these moments of pause as you can," says Auster. "You might think it's insignificant for just a few minutes, but it's really not."
 Unlike with a guided meditation or breathwork, there really aren't many specific directives for this practice. Simply give the sounds your undivided attention. If you do find yourself getting distracted by certain noises outside the recording, though, Auster recommends tuning into those further: "How you react and relate to sound says a lot about you as a person," she says. "If you find a particular sound to be triggering or annoying, then I think it's a very interesting thing to investigate. Why is that happening? There's a lot of information there."
 With consistency and time, you might start to fall into a state that musician Pauline Oliveros dubbed "deep listening"—where you allow all the sounds around you to come into your consciousness without labeling them good or bad.
 "When you begin to resist, the body hardens, the mind hardens," says Auster. Any time you find yourself tensing up this season, consider calling on sound to come back to a place of softening and receptivity.

Unlike many areas of my life, protein is something I take very seriously. So naturally, when someone asks me if protein powder is good or bad for you, my brain basically salivates.
 Protein powders have been around for more years than you or I have been alive, combined. Some claim that whey was discovered over 8,000 years ago by cheesemakers (is there anything they can't do?).

As mentioned above, deciding when and where you want to schedule a new habit is key since doing the same thing in a similar context is what really helps make it stick. But sometimes life happens and you need to switch things up—maybe you get intense period cramps and can't make your gym's HIIT workout, or you get home from work at 9 p.m. and can't fathom cooking your typical healthy dinner. In those cases, having an alternate Plan B routine (that still moves you in the same general direction) is a fantastic idea. That could mean preselecting a specific yoga video you're going to do at home for when you can't get to the gym or picking out a veggie-heavy takeout meal you can quickly order up from a local restaurant when you don't have the energy to cook. The key is figuring out what your Plan B routine will be from the get-go so you don't lose momentum when life inevitably throws you a curveball.

First, you want to make sure your habits are specific and actionable. For example, instead of an intention of "gaining muscle," you might want to consider, "practice 30 minutes of strength training at the gym at 7 a.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays." The first is just an intention; the second is an _implementation_ intention, which may be easier to stick with in the long run. One study found that participants who were asked to set an implementation intention for working out ("During the next week, I will partake in at least 20 minutes of vigorous exercise on [this day] at [this time] in [this place]") were 55% more likely to do so than those who were simply asked to track their workout habits.

Body odor might be embarrassing, but let's be real—it happens to the best of us. You can thank bacteria on your skin, like _Corynebacterium striatum_ and _Staphylococcus haemolyticus._ When sweat mixes with these microbes, the result is a seriously stinky situation.
 Take a dip in an apple cider vinegar bath. As a natural antibacterial, the remedy may keep odor-causing microbes in check. Additionally, by decreasing your skin's pH, it could make your skin a less desirable environment for excess bacteria.
 Again, these benefits are hypothetical, as researchers haven't studied how vinegar baths affect body odor. But if you're looking for a natural way to deodorize, soaking in diluted apple cider vinegar might lend a hand.

My routine begins with quiet time. I am a morning person. I crave an hour of quiet before my household starts to buzz. Within that space, I mindfully sip matcha tea, make my to-do list, and scroll through social media once before the end of the hour. This mindful moment is my favorite way to start the day. Without that routine, my day starts off feeling frenetic and out of sorts.
 One of the most important ways in which I make mindful eating a routine is by making sure to follow the mantra "When you eat, just eat." Before each meal, I religiously plug my phone into a charging station on the wall. This prevents me from becoming distracted by my text messages or email. Sitting down while I eat is an important aspect of mindful eating. To help to make sure this happens, I sit down in the same place at the table.  
 Other routines are linked to my kids' habits. For example, during the hour my daughter plays tennis, I "habit stack" on her routine by doing my workout at the same time. Or when my son plays soccer, I use that hour to walk around the track instead of running errands. Linking my workout with another person's helps keep the routine going.

To be clear, this app isn't for people who want to stop drinking altogether: "We strived to create a judgment-free zone for people wanting to be more aware of their actions over the long term," adds Maser. "We let you define your goals, and we provide what we feel are helpful articles and podcasts to educate along the way."
 With the app's weekly limit marker, you can stay within your unique drinking boundaries discreetly and with intention. After all, we know the resveratrol you get from a little red wine may actually offer some heart-healthy benefits, but too much, on the other hand, may have the opposite effect. So balance is really the key.
 Since I've used the app, for example, it's helped me get a feel for my drinking patterns, as well as encouraged a little more discretion when it comes to going for that second or third drink. Having the app on hand definitely makes you think twice.
 So, whether you want to hit certain fitness goals or you're trying to be more budget-conscious, looking at your alcohol consumption may be a good move for you, especially if you are trying to change some of your habits.

Find a compelling way to elevate the direct impact your company would have on the environment through these efforts. Those quick wins are important (reducing waste, limiting energy usage, occasionally working from home), but getting involved in large-scale climate change efforts as an organization will push your company toward a more developed sustainability initiative. If that's not motivation enough, it's good for business!
 Going back to the reforestation example, you can show management exactly where the trees are being planted and explain the direct impact the trees are having on the environment and society. Through One Tree Planted, your company can spend $1,000 a month and plant 1,000 trees. Do this every month for a year, and then celebrate planting 12,000 trees! This allows you to do much more than reduce your company's carbon footprint. You're also cleaning water in Brazil, protecting biodiversity in Indonesia, empowering women in Rwanda, and fighting back against forest fires in North America.
 It will be easier to get the green light if you make it easy to understand and cut out any additional work on their end. Pitch the ideas to them by creating flashy graphics, get some others on your team to support your suggestions, and step into a leadership role to carry out some of the initiatives you propose if there's no one else to manage them. It might be more work for you at first, but it can also elevate your role within the company and be personally rewarding.
 It's no secret that we're facing a climate crisis. If your company has the resources to get involved and make a difference, motivate your management to do so.

MINNEAPOLIS — The Twins avoided arbitration with five key players on Friday. But more importantly, they locked in a piece of their core for years to come.
 The Twins signed third baseman Miguel Sano to a three-year deal with a club option, a source confirmed Friday night, as they continue to secure their core. The deal is reportedly worth $30 million. He will earn $27 million over three years, per reports, and has a $3 million buyout. The club option for 2023 is reportedly worth $14 million, which would take the deal to $41 million if the fourth year is picked up.
 Sano is coming off a season in which he hit a career-high 34 home runs and drove in a career-high 79 runs. The 26-year-old began last season with a cut on his heel that forced him out of action until May, but once he came back, a dedicated offseason, some mentoring from veteran designated hitter Nelson Cruz and hard work from Sano helped lead to a productive year for the infielder, who slashed .247/.346/.576 in 105 games.

Thumbs down] "What's in a name? That which we call chicanery by any other name would smell as rotten." Perhaps Shakespeare would have written that if confronted with the tale of two Jerries in the Democratic primary race for Constable Precinct 2. One Jerry Garcia is a career law-enforcement officer; the other Jerry Garcia works at a vessel-repair business along the Houston Ship Channel. Both will be on the March 3 ballot but only one is related to incumbent Constable Chris Diaz's wife. Cousin Jerry, as we'll call him to avoid confusion, filed to run hours before the deadline on Dec. 9 and later tried to drop out (the rules wouldn't let him), prompting the other Garcia to cry foul. Diaz -- who is already being sued for allegedly requiring deputies and command staff to help with his re-election campaign -- told the Chronicle he had no comment other than he tried to convince Cousin Jerry not to run. In the words of another immortal bard, "I may have been born at night, but it wasn't last night."

The basic concept of the diet isn't a bad one, but it's how you execute it that matters.
 "If used as a reset and opportunity to get back in the game, then this is great!" Wendie Trubow, M.D., told mbg. "If used as an excuse to load up on carbs and sugar afterward, then that defeats the entire purpose of the removal," she concluded.
 It's important to remember that cutting out carbs and sugar (and caffeine, if you so choose) "cold turkey" may result in some withdrawal symptoms. Common symptoms include headaches and irritability, so be prepared. But you can look forward to the benefits, which makes it worth it (and there are some great tips that can help you better manage quitting).
 You shouldn't use the diet as an excuse to binge afterward, but it can be a good starting point for health. It may be able to help you curb sugar cravings in the long run or serve as a catalyst for learning some new healthy recipes.

Greg R. McCoy   WASHINGTON - Greg R. McCoy, 65, of Washington passed away at 12:25 a.m. on Friday, January 10, 2020. He joined his Lord and Savior peacefully at home, surrounded by loved ones.   He was born on October 11, 1954, in Bloomington, IL, to Harley Russell and Ivy Ann Brown McCoy. He married Cheri Kay Robinson, the love of his life, in Washington, on June 10, 1978. Together they built a prosperous business, a beautiful home and a loving family. She survives.   Also surviving are five children, Jennifer (Andrew) Schaub, Joseph McCoy, Joshua (Misty) McCoy, Megan (Jake) Farden and Kaitlyn (Jon) Leitner; ten grandchildren; three great-grandchildren; and three sisters, Denese (Ken) Anderson of Hopedale, Rita (Bob) Bogardus of Carmel, CA, and Nita Coggins of Suffolk, VA.   He was preceded in death by his parents and one grandson.   Greg found his calling after being hired at PEMCO Service Company in 1974. He loved the daily change of pace and working with his hands. He founded Total Petroleum Service Company in 1982, where he was President until his death. What began as a modest startup out of his home, grew into the successful company that it is today. Working in the petroleum industry, he was also a member of the PEI and IPMA.   Greg was always happy to lend a helping hand when something needed fixed or a remodeling project was underway. He was mechanically inclined and a "jack of all trades," but woodworking was his true passion. He was a builder by nature, and enjoyed making furniture for loved ones. He took pride in his three acre property, keeping it meticulously mowed and maintained. Even though he was not affiliated with a specific church, he was strong in his Christian faith. He was a true family man, spending most of his time with his wife, children and grandchildren, who lovingly call him "Papaw." To his family he was a provider, a protector and a patriarch, and he will be greatly missed.   Visitation will be on Tuesday, January 14, 2020, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. at Deiters Funeral Home and Crematory in Washington. His funeral service will follow at 1 p.m. Interment will be at Fondulac Cemetery in East Peoria.   Memorial contributions may be made to MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, TX.   Greg's memorial website is available at www.deitersfuneralhome.com, where condolences may also be sent to the family.

Since President Trump ordered the killing of Iran's General Qassem Soleimani on Jan. 3, politicians and citizens alike have questioned the operation's legitimacy. In the absence of a declaration of war, was the targeted killing of an enemy on foreign soil justified? Further, was it effective?      The first question, was Soleimani's killing justified, does not allow for a short answer. Justified by what measure? Expediency? Safety? Morality? Ethicists have wrestled with such questions for centuries and have provided guidelines for what is just.      The idea that war may sometimes be justified is thousands of years old. Aristotle introduced the concept into the West, and St. Augustine revisited the idea from a biblically informed and classically trained mindset. In just war theory, certain thresholds must be met before an act of violence can be considered just. Does the killing of Soleimani meet those thresholds?      The first threshold is that the act of violence must be ordered by a legitimate authority. Since President Trump ordered the military action, and he is the U.S. commander in chief, this qualification seems to be met. One might object, however, that without the Iraqi government's consent - Soleimani was in Iraq at the time - the U.S. president's authority was not legitimate.      The second threshold requires there to be sufficient cause to take the violent action. It could be (and has been) argued that, since General Soleimani had been responsible for a campaign of terror and death, the second threshold had already been met.      Another requirement is that the act of violence was righteously motivated. Motivation is difficult to determine and President Trump's changing explanations - sometimes claiming he was "preventing imminent and sinister attacks" and at other times sounding like he was enacting vengeance - do not help. But since motive is so hard to determine, it might be best to leave this one alone.      Just war theory also requires that the act of violence be a last resort. Since other actions, notably economic sanctions, were previously taken, one could argue this threshold has been met. A further requirement is that the action be proportionate to the desired intent. This is hard to discern, given the administration's equivocal explanations.      Perhaps the most challenging threshold to be met is that the action can be reasonably expected to improve the situation - that it is likely to right wrongs and increase the probability of lasting peace. With this, we move from the question of the action's justification to that of its effectiveness.      Commentators who applaud Mr. Trump's decision are quick to make the case that the killing of the general has made the world a safer place. Soleimani, they say, was the hinge on which the Iranian campaign of destabilization turned. They regard him as a unique and irreplaceable evil genius whose death will impede Iran's campaign of regional violence for the foreseeable future.      Maybe. But predicting the future is not in my skill set and I've never known anyone, political commentators included, who have mastered it. What I do know is that evil will not be overcome by evil. It will only be overcome by good.      Was the killing of Soleimani justified? Who knows? Will it be effective? It is doubtful. In the short term, his death may hinder Iran's efforts to destabilize regional governments and drive the U.S. military out of the Middle East. In the long term, his death may elevate equally capable military officers and inspire an enduring hatred of the U.S. among a younger generation. The killing of one terrorist may inspire a thousand to take his place.      The only way to overcome evil, as St. Paul made clear, is with good. This may seem naive but it is actually efficient. Truth is one example of an overcoming good. Rather than rely on military might alone, our leaders should make known to the people of Iran the truth about General Soleimani and the regime he served. Their ongoing campaign of violence and hatred should be exposed.      If it is argued that such an approach underestimates the evil that Iran represents, one might counter that it correctly estimates the good that truth accomplishes. If our goal is lasting peace, it is the epitome of naivete to believe that military action alone can accomplish it.
