Bilingual entertainment network LATV will premiere its spring lineup March 17 with a new talk show, a daily celebrity-oriented program and an interactive music-video show, among others.
 “As our national reach grows, so does the scope of LATV’s programming,” LATV president Danny Crowe said. “With our new [vice president of] programming, Luca Bentivoglio, on board, we are expanding our offerings to include a wider range of what we’re known for: ground-breaking, bilingual shows.”
 LATV, a digital multicast network, recently signed its 30th affiliate.
 New programs include _En la Zona_ , a 30-minute show about music, film and fashion; _Classic en Concierto_ , a music show; _Texty Videos_ , which features music videos and viewers’ text messages; and _Verdad y Fama_ , a biopic program focused on entertainment and sports luminaries.

A new poll suggests Canadians are increasingly wearing protective face masks as they emerge from months of isolating at home to curb the spread of COVID-19.
 And it suggests that fear of a second wave of infections as bad or worse than the first wave may be behind their increased caution.
 Just over half of respondents to the Leger and Association for Canadian Studies survey said they have worn masks to go grocery shopping, 45 per cent to go to the pharmacy, 17 per cent at work, 14 per cent on public transit and 12 per cent when they've gone for walks.
 In each case, the percentage saying they have worn masks has gone up by two to eight points in one week.
 Fifty-three per cent — up two points — said masks should be mandatory in public and confined spaces.
 The online poll, conducted June 5 to 7, surveyed 1,523 adult Canadians; it cannot be assigned a margin of error because internet-based polls are not considered random samples.

 Ontario Premier Doug Ford is expected to announce the province's plan to reopen child-care centres today.
 Ford says the plan will help support parents who are returning to work as Ontario's economy gradually reopens.
 Ford said Monday that most Ontario regions outside the Toronto area will be allowed to open more businesses and activities on Friday.
 Restaurant patios, hair salons and swimming pools will reopen as the province takes a regional approach to restarting the economy.
 The limit on social gatherings will increase from five to 10, but people must still stay two metres away from anyone outside their own household.
 Some child-care centres in the province have remained opened throughout the pandemic to provide free service to the families of essential workers.

 Two RCMP officers have been charged in the shooting death of a 31-year-old man in northern Alberta almost two years ago.
 Cpl. Randy Stenger and Const. Jessica Brown of the Whitecourt RCMP detachment were arrested Friday and were each charged with one count of criminal negligence causing death, the province's police watchdog said Monday.
 The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) said that Clayton Crawford died from multiple gunshot wounds inside a car after a confrontation with police on July 3, 2018.
 Mounties had been investigating another shooting the day before at a home in Valhalla Centre, Alta., about 65 kilometres northwest of Grande Prairie. ASIRT said the officers were looking for a witness or possible victim in that case, when they discovered a man sleeping in the driver's seat of a vehicle parked at a rest stop near Whitecourt.
 During the confrontation, the vehicle was "put into motion" and one officer fired a service pistol while the other discharged a carbine rifle, the agency said.

Even though the Cardinals dropped a 72-38 decision to top-seeded Parkersburg in the state quarterfinals, they were one of 18 teams that played one game at the girls tournament. Six girls squads didn't play, nor did any boys teams, as the tournament was postponed and eventually canceled becaus of the coronavirus pandemic.
 Brooks posted a double-double with 16 points and 11 rebounds in the defeat, part of a solid postseason that saw her scored 26 points with 13 rebounds in a game against Musselman and 27 points in a co-regional against Jefferson. Notably, Brooks connected on the game-winning free throw in the win over Musselman.
 Brooks averaged nearly 18 points per game in leading Spring Mills.
 She wrapped up a strong career for the Cardinals by becoming the school's first 1,000-point career scorer for girls.
 She earned second-team all-state honors by the West Virginia Sports Writers Association and was selected to the all-Eastern Panhandle Athletic Conference squad for her play during the season.

Di seguito la nota diffusa da Massimo Ripepi - Il sindaco Falcomatà e l’assessore Neri corrono ai ripari con tecniche di distrazione di massa. Adesso spuntano le eco-balle, la soluzione tampone che trasformerà i rifiuti di Reggio Calabria in masse compatte da spedire nei capannoni di Sambatello. Il sindaco asserisce che l’operazione è a costo zero, ma la realtà è che come sempre pagheranno i cittadini senza avere una vera risoluzione del problema, se non una temporanea ripulitura della città: il tempo necessario perché Falcomatà completi la sua campagna elettorale. Una soluzione da fumo negli occhi insomma, dato che Falcomatà come è nel suo stile propagandistico, mente sapendo di mentire e gettando sulle spalle della Regione responsabilità che, invece, sono ascrivibili solo a lui e alla sua pessima amministrazione. Quindi di balla qui ve n’è una sola, ovvero il fatto che Falcomatà, già richiamato da Oliverio e tacciato dal suo stesso partito di non saper gestire l’organizzazione dei rifiuti in maniera adeguata, già svergognato dall’ex presidente e ora anche commissariato dalla giunta Santelli, continua a denigrare la Regione Calabria per qualcosa che avrebbe dovuto fare lui, in quanto sindaco. Si ricordi infatti che la Città Metropolitana è in possesso delle deleghe per gestire il ciclo dei rifiuti, ma non avendo il Sindaco né la volontà né la capacità di decidere, chiede a tutti provvedimenti d’urgenza dietro i quali nascondersi. Negli ultimi quattro anni Falcomatà si è reso indisponibile a partecipare personalmente alle riunioni in merito alla questione e all’organizzazione delle funzioni di delega, dimenticando peraltro le innumerevoli azioni messe in atto dal passato regime commissariale, ora riconfermato dalla stessa Santelli, considerato che la Regione non intende più assumersi, e ha ragione, obblighi che rimandano invece al territorio di Reggio. Nella Città Metropolitana, difatti, ricadono gli impianti tecnologici di Sambatello e nella provincia tutti gli impianti di trattamento dei rifiuti urbani; all’amministrazione comunale inoltre, l’incarico di realizzare l’Ecodistretto, sempre in località Sambatello, grazie al quale avrebbe dovuto avviarsi la filiera del riciclaggio. Funzioni di non poco conto a cui Falcomatà si è rifiutato, per negligenza, di dare il doveroso seguito, mentre ora tenta di attivare provvedimenti di emergenza solo per abbindolare i suoi cittadini. Rifacendo nottetempo il look alla città, il sindaco pensa di assicurarsi un nuovo mandato, ma i reggini devono essere consapevoli che l’ordinanza n. 246 del 2019 inchiodava Falcomatà e la sua equipe ad una serie di obblighi “in via d’urgenza”. In particolare l’individuazione della discarica per l’Ecodistretto di Siderno. Non avendo ottemperato a tale ordinanza veniva già nominato come commissario l’Ing. Pietro Foti, dirigente settore ambiente della Città Metropolitana. Ora sull’adempimento del Piano Rifiuti anche la Santelli non ci sta e con una delibera regionale (n. 97) del 20 maggio scorso, rinnova i poteri al commissario in acta Ing. Foti del Dipartimento Ambiente, affinché si sostituisca al sindaco e al Consiglio Comunale nell’ottemperare l’ordinanza del 2019, completando le mansioni che Falcomatà non è stato in grado e soprattutto non ha voluto concludere con azioni determinanti. Il consigliere comunale Ripepi, commissario di FDI della Città Metropolitana, ribadisce che «ancora una volta il sindaco si fa beffa dei suoi concittadini trascinandoli nel gioco della distrazione, narcotizzandoli con il momentaneo appianamento della questione, nascondendo loro la verità delle cose e per giunta permettendosi di allungare ombre sulla Regione Calabria, quando già dai tempi di Oliverio non solo la città usufruiva delle deleghe, ma Falcomatà veniva richiamato per inattuabilità dell’ordinanza n. 246. Un sindaco, insomma, che davvero non si vergogna davanti alla cittadinanza e che pensa di poter manovrare, facendo dimenticare sei anni di completo disastro. Noi siamo qui per ricordare al sindaco e all’assessore, che non è più tempo di prendere in giro la città».

Republican Federal Communications Commission member Robert McDowell said technology is driving an a la carte model that doesn't need a push from government. He also suggested that open-access mandates on just-acutioned advance wireless spectrum was nothing to brag about.
 In a speech to a technology policy summit in Hollywood (according to a prepared text of his remarks), McDowell said government-mandated a la carte cable service could drive up cable rates, drive down programming quality and and make ad revenues disappear.
 Republican chairman Kevin Martin has argued that requiring cable operators to provide per-channel programming would do the opposite.
 McDowell said the market is already delivering a la carte without government "help." He added that millions of people were "flocking" to sites like Hulu, Joos, Veoh and Gofish, and that that the revolution in content choice and delivery is going mobile. "Would these developments exist today if the government had tried to engineer them through mandates? Probably not," he said.
 He also pointed to a First Amendment problem, saying that the government was "preclude[d] from dictating to operators and programmers how their programming must be packaged and sold," and adding that a prescriptive à la carte mandate would probably be shot down in court on First Amendment grounds alone.
 McDowell also diverged from the chairman in his handicapping of the just- completed 700-megahertz auction. The FCC, with Martin's backing but not McDowell's, put open-access conditions on a swath of spectrum sufficient to create a national wireless network and potentially a "third pipe" competitor to Verizon Communications and AT&T. But no single company bid enough to get all the licenses as a package.
 Commenting on the auction after it closed last week, Martin touted the conditions, saying, "With the open-platform requirements on one-third of the spectrum, consumers will be able to use the wireless device of their choice on those networks and download whatever software or applications they want on it," adding that the conditions will have "a significant effect on the next phase of wireless-broadband innovation."
 McDowell suggested that the market was already heading toward open access and "for the government to take credit for sparking a drive toward open access is a bit like a rooster taking credit for the sunrise." He also said he had a theory as to why no major player bid for the C block of spectrum that could have created the new competitive national network.
 McDowell said the result of open-access mandates was to disadvantage the smaller players the FCC tried to help by dividing some of the spectrum into smaller, presumably more affordable, blocks. "In other words," he added, "it is apparent from the auction results that larger companies outbid smaller companies in the smaller blocks in order to avoid the open-access mandate. In the name of openness, did the auction design push rural players and smaller entrepreneurs out of the wireless marketplace?" His answer was yes.

While top-notch researchers are adept at crunching numbers to find trends and truths, Mary Beth Marks takes data interpretation to a whole other level.
 The new VP of research at Crawford Johnson & Northcott (CJN) specializes in behavioral research, studying how and why people make the decisions they make. And not only can Marks give uniquely incisive research on TV viewing based on her three decades in the business, she also has some pretty extensive talent- coaching chops as well.
 “I'm a psychologist by training,” Marks says. “My background is primarily in attitude design and attitude measurement. Over the years, I'd sit with on-air people and talk about what we could do to improve and take advantage of their profile in the market.”
 It took a bit of courting to get Marks on board at CJN, which assists some 70 stations around the country with strategic planning, promotions and talent training. Marks lives in Bozeman, Mont., and has spent the past 14 years running her own MBM Associates media research firm (she did contract jobs over the years for CJN)—and enjoying the expansive nature outside her door. Described as a “mountain-climbing, snowboard-riding, independent thinker” by CJN co-founder Bruce Northcott, Marks says she yearned to be a team member, even if it meant pitching in remotely from Big Sky Country.
 “I get to have this great collaboration with creative people,” she says. “That can be a little tough when you're working on your own, brainstorming against yourself, walking around the room saying, 'Hey Mary Beth—what do you think of that?'”
 A native of Cleveland, Marks' career began in academia. After getting her Ph.D. at the University of Colorado, she taught consumer behavior at the University of Michigan School of Business, then joined media research firm Frank N. Magid Associates for the first time in 1982, working her way up to director of research development. Elden Hale, now VP and general manager at WSMV Nashville, credits Marks' research acumen with helping WNEP Scranton grow from what he calls “No. 4 in a three-station market to a powerhouse No. 1.”
 Marks jumped to the client side in 1986, overseeing research for the two- station group Kelly Broadcasting, which owned Sacramento power KCRA and KCPQ Seattle, before moving up to VP of marketing.
 Marks credits her time at Kelly with teaching her to multi-task (one of her duties involved researching and helping with the marketing and distribution of a pair of Kelly-produced newsmagazines), and cites co-owner Jon Kelly for his risk-taking, innovation and insistence that every element of research lead to concrete knowledge. “It was imperative as I put together a research project for clients that virtually every question we ask has to have some actionable result to it,” she says. “That's my approach today.”
 It was with Kelly that Marks put her anchor-coaching skills to good use, studying talent-related research to help anchors improve on-air performance. Audrey Farrington, the longtime general manager at KTXL Sacramento before resigning earlier this month, says she learned the depth of Marks' talents after many years of competing against Kelly's KCRA. More recently, Farrington credits Marks' work in “solidifying” the late-news team's on-air rapport, and boosting KTXL to tops in adults 25-54 in February's late-news race.
 “Mary Beth has two great skills,” says Farrington. “One is her amazing ability to speak in a language that talent understands. The other is her ability to find that thing that can help them with their skills. She's got a very broad skill set but is very specific in her recommendations.”
 After six years at Kelly, Marks shifted back to Magid. Setting up in Los Angeles as a senior consultant, she advised clients such as Twentieth Television, Warner Bros. and NBC, and worked closely with Northcott, Magid's president at the time. Northcott went on to found CJN in 1998, and stayed in touch with Marks, tapping her research skills on a freelance basis for CJN. When co-founder/research wiz Bob Crawford left the Des Moines-based firm in January, Northcott ramped up a long-term effort to get Marks on-board full time. “I'd been working on Mary Beth for several years,” he says. “I guess I finally wore her down.”
 Two months into the new gig, Marks is focused on, among other things, tackling new media to deliver better research results on local news viewing. She says popular viewer-insight methods early in her career included door-to-door interviews, and when people became skittish about letting strangers in, it shifted to phone interviews. With consumers that much more on the go now, it's not only surveys conducted via the Web, but via text messaging as well. “We need to continue to evolve in how we reach out to people to get our information,” she says.
 Marks communicates with the rest of the CJN staff on a Monday phone meeting, and finds herself at the local Gallatin Field airport a few times a month to get out and see clients around the country. She ended up in Bozeman through her husband, Randall Roberts, a fine-arts photographer and 30-year resident of the area. During downtime, she enjoys watching the likes of _Cold Case_ , _Dancing With the Stars_ , _Days of Our Lives_ (which she says she got hooked on while doing research on it years ago), and Cleveland Indians baseball via MLB.com.
 But mostly, Mary Beth and Randall are out and about, hiking with their black Lab and their Irish setter, and—don't tell Bruce and the gang stuck in the office—snowboarding after a winter storm. “Occasionally, when there's fresh powder falling, you just have to pull that board out,” she says with a laugh.
 Northcott says he and Marks' shared interests go beyond work. “We're both obsessed with the rivers and mountains of the West,” he says, “as well as why people watch what they watch on TV.”         To see a gallery of Fifth Estater caricatures, click here

It's not difficult to get here, even for me, who have never visited such places, it was easy to get inside. The main thing is not to get lost. I was there on weekdays and in the 6 times I was there, I only once met two guys who tried to climb on the roof, but they were harmless. We even managed to communicate, but we could not get to the roof. Therefore, in the daytime, the contingent is not dangerous. Although I was not alone, but still two girls photographers were a little scared without the accompaniment of some strong guy. You never know. But all these fears and concerns are worth it. Just look at this historical giant from the last floors, look at the courtyard, then immediately fear goes into the background. You just admire this architectural ensemble of the last century. This is a Paradise for photographers and models. You can implement many different ideas here. But the feeling is twofold. On the one hand, you admire the size of this giant, and on the other hand, you see the devastation. In my opinion, everyone who lives in St. Petersburg should visit this place. At least to make great photos and put a check mark in the list of interesting attractions.

So, a new HTC phone is coming out in just 7 days, are we excited? And should you be? Well, yes and no. On one hand, it’s always intriguing to see what a company that’s eager to make a return will offer. Usually, they’d want to make a compelling offer to get people’s attention.      However, knowing what we know about the Desire 20 Pro doesn’t really make us giddy with anticipation. Snapdragon 665, 6GB of RAM, punch-hole display and a few cameras on the back is basically the recipe for a run-of-the-mill Android midranger right now.      Two major questions remain to be answered: price and availability. Pricing the phone aggressively could ensure that the phone will see some success, but Samsung has already occupied the midrange space with Galaxy A-series phones that are priced very competitively. It will be hard to convince people to buy a phone from a company that may or may not make another one.      Availability will likely be limited as well. It’s doubtful if the phone will reach European markets and the US is almost out of the question at this point. Rumors suggest HTC will also release a 5G phone later this year, so perhaps it will be the one making the rounds in the west.      Either way, HTC is back on our radar and we’re eager to see what’s coming next.

All things considered, a Galaxy Tab S20 label was clearly not outside the realm of possibility for the company's next premium Android slate, although several sources pointed instead to a less drastic Tab S7 moniker in recent weeks. That latter theory is supported by a brand-new Bluetooth SIG certification (via MySmartPrice), which also suggests the formal announcement and commercial release of the Galaxy Tab S7+ might be right around the corner.
   
 These regulatory documents rarely reveal actual specs and features of unannounced devices, of course, and unfortunately, that appears to be the case today as well. Fortunately, we already have the 12.4-inch screen size on pretty good authority, and naturally, where there's a Galaxy Tab S7+, there should also be a "regular-sized" Tab S7 with a display rumored to circle the 11-inch mark.
   
 That would obviously make both new high-end models significantly larger than last year's 10.5-inch Galaxy Tab S6, which may have been enough to justify a leap to a Tab S20 name making Samsung's overall branding strategy feel more coherent and cohesive. But perhaps the rest of the upgrades are simply not as meaningful.
