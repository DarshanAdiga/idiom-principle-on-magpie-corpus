It is paramount that I stress this fact, because it's foundational to everything I have to say on this subject moving forward.

Home sales may be searing hot in Santa Fe and across the country, but the planned Oct. 14 auction of the 3,250-acre Saddleback Ranch in Galisteo was delayed because several bidders asked for more clarity on property details, an auction official said.
 Saddleback is still the highest-priced home sale in Santa Fe County in the 21st century. The property, with two luxury homes, last sold in 2008 for $17.45 million, according to the Santa Fe Association of Realtors.
 Bidders asked for “some additional time for due diligence … to give them more of a comfort level with bidding,” Miami-based Platinum Luxury Auctions President Trayor Lesnock said in an email. “In light of that, we decided to reschedule the auction for a date-to-be-determined in order to give prospects that time.”
 The ranch comes with 30,000 square feet of structural improvements, including the six-bedroom, 7,264-square-foot Drogheda Estate and the four-bedroom, 6,103-square-foot Windland Estate. The property also has an eight-car garage and 10-stall barn.
 Five registered bidders were invited to submit offers before the rescheduled auction, and Platinum is in negotiations with parties that have presented offers, Lesnock said.
 A sale may be negotiated before the auction is scheduled again, likely in the first quarter of 2021, Lesnock said in an interview.

I began noticing that the women were making moves to ink deals with talent agencies beginning last summer. The irony of their goal of tearing down our capitalist society and replacing it with a Marxist society has been a part of the story all along. The three women, Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza, and Opal Tometi, have all signed on to Hollywood agencies. Over the weekend, Patrisse Cullors made news for signing a deal with Warner Brothers Television Group (WBTVG). It is a multi-year, wide-ranging deal. Generally speaking, Cullors will develop and produce original programming across “all platforms, including broadcast, cable, and streaming.” More specifically, her deal includes “scripted and unscripted series, longform series, animated and kids programming, as well as digital content.” In other words, she’s been given carte blanche by Warner Brothers. Details of the deal were not announced. The Marxist doesn’t want you to know exactly how big she is cashing in with capitalism, you see.

Examining the parable of the Good Samaritan, I find no proof that the pagans seems totally good or the Jews are totally bad. This concept can only be found by a person who is incapable of understanding the human soul. We find good and bad (according to our own social codes) in all cultures, societies and families. Even among executioners there may be one who tries to lessen the suffering, whilst another does not care how the axe falls. Therefore, to believe that all believers are good and all atheists bad, or visa versa, is pure idiocy. Good and evil have no homeland, skin colour, sex or religion. For both society and the individual, Christian doctrine indicates the best way not to derail. Represents the moral codes of life, not the character trends of an individual.

As international travel is expected to ramp up next year, some say they'd consider turning to the private sector for a COVID-19 test to fulfil requirements of their destination.
 A new survey from Angus Reid commissioned by travel company Sunwing found 56 per cent of Canadians are considering going on vacation in the near future. Over 70 per cent of regular vacationgoers said they are considering an upcoming getaway.
 Allison Wallace with Flight Centre Canada says the travel agency is also seeing an increase in inquiries for destinations abroad, with sunny places like Mexico showing the most interest.
 "The general sentiment seems to be that people aren't planning anything outside of Canada until 2021," Wallace said.
 Getting tested, insurance and quarantine requirements are the top questions Canadians are asking.
 For testing, the majority of destinations allowing travellers require negative tests within 72 hours before getting on a plane, Wallace said.
 But access to tests varies by province and some clinics won't do a test if the reason for one is non-essential travel.
 "As a result, we are advising travellers that require proof of a negative test to check with their local clinics to ensure they can get one and that they can get the result within the required period of time," Wallace said.
 Private testing for COVID-19 could offer would-be travellers a certain degree of security.
 Ichor Blood Services is one company in Alberta offering private COVID-19 testing. For a fee of $120, the company will come to an individual's home to conduct the test, which has a targeted turnaround time between 48 and 72 hours.
 The company also offers a serology test for $80 that detects virus antibodies, which tells someone whether they have been infected with COVID-19 in the past.
 Ichor Blood Services declined an interview with Postmedia.
 Currently, in preparation for the winter cold and flu season, COVID-19 testing in Alberta prioritizes those with symptoms and vulnerable groups who are more at risk of contracting or spreading COVID-19. Tests also prioritize close contacts of confirmed cases and workers or residents at outbreak sites.
 However, asymptomatic testing is available for teachers and school staff, health-care workers, and staff and residents at congregate living facilities like long-term care. People experiencing homelessness and travellers who need a test before leaving also qualify for asymptomatic testing.
 Postmedia posed the question of when and why someone would pay for a private test on Facebook, where responses were divided over the role of for-profit private testing.
 Some commented that private testing could edge out the public system, or that it was unfair to people who couldn't afford to pay.
 Others were more open to private testing.
 Lori Blatz believes private tests could be used to fill a gap in the health- care system.
 "For example, you have a coworker that becomes ill and gets sent home. And maybe that coworker is insisting, 'No, I'm fine, it's fine,' " Blatz said. "You could maybe as a company, have that coworker go for private testing, and get results possibly sooner than what you would through the province."
 What would be more enticing, Blatz said, is if private companies could deliver results within a day.
 "The biggest stumbling block for me isn't necessarily just private, it's if you're paying that, I would expect my results under 24 hours," Blatz said.
 "Because you actually need to go from the testing site into immediate self- isolation, otherwise you run the risk of contaminating yourself between the two … that's why that 24-hour window would be really important if you're needing the results in order to be able to go somewhere."

The Panthers have two of the top five ranked runners in the state for 3A in Keegan McCaw and Lincoln High. When you have that kind of clout, you would expect to win.
 It gets even tougher for anyone else to get in the hunt, when you narrow things down to just the District 5 runners and four of the top five times in the district belong to Snake River. It should be just a workout for the Panthers to claim another district title and qualify their team for the state meet next week.
 For the girls, they will win, hands down. They have dominated this district and conference for a number of years and this year is no different. They will have the only full team, so this meet is all about qualifying as many runners as possible to continue the experience gathering for a young team and keep building towards a state title as well.
 The top five times in this district belong to Snake River runners, led by freshman Hailey Raymond and sophomore Kylee Morgan. When you add in another freshman in Allister Dillow, three of the top five runners are still learning how to run and will rely on the two seniors, Kierra Jensen and Morgan Sensenbach, to lead them around the course this week on their way to another title and trip to the state meet.

The 4A, High Country Conference/District 6 meet will be held at Freeman Park in Idaho Falls and looks to be Blackfoot boys’ chance to pick up a district title and make a run at a state title as well.
 With four of the top runners in the High Country Conference, led by Eli Gregory, Matt Thomas, Paden Parmenter and JT Morgan; the Broncos should have little trouble holding off Skyline for the district title and advancing the entire team to the state meet. This team is very young and the future is very bright for this group of runners who have their best days in front of them.
 For the girls, their best days may be in front of them as it looks like Skyline is the team to beat. They have a solid group of runners ranked in the top five of the district and are definitely the team to beat. The Lady Broncos are improving, but are still learning and will continue to add the pieces they need to get to the top.
 In 2A, Nuclear Conference/District 6 meet, which will be hosted by Firth this year, it looks like a walk in the park for Salmon. They have dominated several of the local cross country meets this year, even taking down a lot of the 4A and 5A programs in the process. In the recent meet in Firth, Johnathon Simmons beat the field which included teams like Rigby, Blackfoot and Snake River and the senior has a younger brother who is only a freshman that has put pressure on him for the top spot on the team. There is depth and quality on the Salmon team who should be the winner. That is too bad for North Fremont, Ririe, West Jefferson and Firth, because three of the top teams in the state reside in this conference and there are only two automatic team berths to state. Someone will have to get lucky and get a wild card berth to advance.
 For the girls, West Jefferson and Salmon will battle it out for the top spot and it should be a great battle to watch. Firth’s top runner is Cassi Robbins and the multiple state champion in track has improved all season long and deserves a chance to qualify in here as well. If it comes down to a sprint, the 400 meter champion in track from 2019 may be tough down the stretch for sure.
 The 1A, District 5 meet will be held at Bear Lake and there will be a handful of individuals representing Sho-Ban in the meet. They don’t have enough runners to field a team for either boys or girls, but their individuals have shown up for every meet and they will be there this week, trying to grab one of the individual spots at the State of Idaho Cross Country meet next week.
 Well that wraps up the quick preview of the local teams with Blackfoot and Snake River looking like they will be bringing home the hardware this week and there will be a recap of their district results as well as a preview of their chances at a state title next week in Pocatello.

Nearly 800,000 Pennsylvania voters already have mailed or personally delivered their ballots for the Nov. 3 general election, but they’re not the only ones mailing it in.
 All House seats and half of the state’s 50 Senate seats are on the ballot. By delaying resolution of the state budget until after the Nov. 3 election, legislators not only have escaped judgment by the nearly 800,000 Pennsylvanians who already have voted, but by millions more voters who will do so by the time the polls close.
 The lawmakers and Gov. Tom Wolf passed a partial, $25 billion-plus budget in May, well ahead of the July 1 start to the new fiscal year — the traditional date for implementing a new budget.
 According to legislative leaders, uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic’s economic impact made it impossible to pass a full-year budget. That’s a fair assessment. The loss in sales tax, and corporate and personal income tax revenue now is expected to create a deficit of up to $5.5 billion.
 That does not explain, however, why the legislators chose to enact the rest of the budget as lame ducks rather than as lawmakers who are accountable to the public on the eve of an impending election. They could have chosen the end of October as the deadline for a complete budget but chose Nov. 30. That put them beyond the reach of voters for nearly two full years until the next legislative elections.
 Republican majorities in both houses have been highly critical of Wolf’s handling of the pandemic, especially regarding transparency. Refusing to tackle the budget prior to the election just proves that such talk is cheap.
 Declining to share with voters their ideas for handling the economic crisis until after the election is the opposite of transparency that should, by itself, offer instruction to the rapidly declining number of voters who have not yet cast their ballots.

"I hope we're not too much of a surprise, but we've had some success here and feel like we're where we should be," Neander said. "We spend a lot of time trying to make sure we talk about activating our work force, making sure that the people that we have working here develop enough comfort and a feeling of security that they'll speak up, that they'll share their thoughts, that they'll be willing to put themselves out there without fear of the consequences of being wrong or being off the mark. And I think from a cultural standpoint, giving them a place especially in sports where it's so cutthroat, there's so much turnover, that only lends itself to people not speaking up and sometimes they feel the best way to advance is they say nothing."

And it was something that was really important to us when I was with the Rays. And it's something it's really important to us now. I think when guys are more comfortable, they perform better.

All the more disappointing was the race result with ninth and tenth for Newey and Habsburg. After his initial lead, the Austrian’s pace became slower and slower due to a tire problem and he had to come into the pits for a second tire change.

Commissioner Whitney Manwaring from Bingham County asked about those who see adverse effects from flu shots and what they should do if they are concerned about it. Dr. Snell and SIPH Director Maggie Mann explained that because a flu vaccination does not carry a live virus, they should not be concerned about receiving one. However, there are documented cases where people find themselves feeling ill for a short period of time.
 These outliers are normal, according to the doctor, who explained that he himself has experienced those side effects, but still believes it is the best option to help prevent any unnecessary stress on the hospital system.
 Snell explained that the hospitals along the I-15 corridor are in constant communication among themselves, and they are all feeling the pressure from the pandemic. They have not had to eliminate or lessen elective surgeries at this point, but the concern is that if something does not change, that would be the next step to ensure the best possible results for the safety and well-being of their patients.
 He added that they are hiring 27 new nurses at PRMC, and will continue to utilize the nursing students from Idaho State University even as other hospitals go away from using nursing students during the pandemic. Snell explained that their reasoning for continuing the utilization of this outlet will benefit them in the long run because they will already know and understand the computer systems being used at PRMC and will be easier to train.
 The last question asked to Snell came from Vaughn Rassmussen, who asked if people can contract COVID-19 through other fluids such as sweat. Snell responded that at this point, it is known to be a respiratory virus and transmitted through vapor from the nose and mouth; the only way it would be contracted through sweat would be if someone had sneezed, coughed, or saliva on someone’s sweat and then it was transmitted through it.
 It was also noted that when large numbers of new cases are reported by the health district, if it is coming from a weekend or holiday weekend such as last Tuesday’s report, it is for multiple days they are added together.

Right around the time Cody Bellinger’s blast found the outfield seats in Game 7 of the National League Championship Series on Sunday night, one of Santa Fe’s own was deep in the bowels of Globe Life Park going nuts as if he were standing at home plate waiting to high-five the Dodgers’ slugger as he crossed the dish.
 “You know, moments like that never get old,” said Ron Porterfield, who grew up with Dodger blue in his veins and now has a front office spot with the organization he has loved for a lifetime.
 Hired as the team’s director of player health in 2017, the 1983 St. Michael’s graduate will be part of the World Series for the fourth time in a career that dates back to the late 1980s when he and a handful of other New Mexico State graduates broke into professional baseball as athletic trainers.
 Porterfield’s stops include more minor league parks than he can count, but also two decades with the team the Dodgers will face in Game 1 on Tuesday night in Arlington, Texas. For a dozen years he was Tampa Bay’s head trainer. Before that he had eight additional years with the Rays and nine with the Houston Astros.
 It’s overstating the obvious, but the biggest part of Porterfield’s job this year has been dealing with COVID-19 protocols.
 “I’m tired of hearing podcasts about putting an asterisk by this season because it’s only 60 games,” he said Monday after a conference call with MLB officials about medical procedures for the final week of the wild and wacky 2020 season. “They need to put a star by it. To get this season off the ground, the people that are talking about putting an asterisk by this have no idea what it took just to get this season going. Zero.”
 To actually get to this point without a major incident is a testimony to the work done by hundreds of health officials who work for MLB, he said.
 “In May, when they first started talking about this I thought, ‘no way we’re playing this year, there’s no chance,’ ” Porterfield said. “We couldn’t do a bubble like the NBA did because you can’t put, what, 18 stadiums together in one area. That would be impossible, but the protocols that had to go into place, the talks between the players’ association and Major League Baseball, getting everyone to agree, getting the players to comply, then staff coming in, and ownership, then state-by-state county regulations — we had to jump through some serious hoops. So an asterisk on this season? Please.”
 Each team has specific personnel assigned to administer and collect testing kits from players, but Porterfield’s job with the Dodgers was to set up the scheduling. It’s a daily task that can be tough, particularly on the pitching staff. Starters have a different routine as position players, so coordinating a time, place and method for conducting tests for each one can be a challenge.
 For most of his time with the Rays, Porterfield was as much of a fixture in the dugout as Joe Maddon or Evan Longoria. As head trainer, he had the best seat in the house, mingling with the players every night, home or road. With Los Angeles in the time of COVID-19, protocols prohibit him from sitting in the dugout.
 As fun as it would have been to have Bellinger slam his dislocated shoulder against Porterfield on the top step, he had his own moment with the rest of the training staff back in the clubhouse — and that’s just fine with the man many in Santa Fe still refer to as Ron John.
 “I’ve already had my time in the sun, so it’s some other guys’ chance to do that,” he said.
 Regardless of what happens in the next few days, New Mexico will have a world champion. One of Tampa Bay’s assistant trainers is Mike Sandoval, a native of Raton who graduated the same semester as Porterfield from NMSU in December 1988. The pair broke into pro ball at the same time and it was through Porterfield’s recommendation that Tampa Bay hire Sandoval to work with the organization’s Triple-A affiliate in Durham, N.C., a decade ago.
 “I love the guy and I still have a lot of friends on that side, but when the Series starts I’m all about us beating them because, you know, I want that ring,” Porterfield said. “Anyone but us and I’m rooting for Mike and those guys. I want my Champagne bath.”
 Sandoval spent six years in Durham, then joined the big league club in 2017 when Porterfield left Tampa Bay for the job with the Dodgers. For Porterfield, this is his fourth foray into the Fall Classic, having done so in 2008 when the Rays lost to the Phillies, and again for L.A.’s losses to Houston (2017) and Boston (2018).
 He said he got to feeling a little nostalgic one morning this summer when he was out for a run in the Chavez Ravine area. With a clear view of Dodger Stadium’s upper entrance on one side and Griffith Park and its famed Hollywood sign on the other, he had a flashback to his youth when his parents took the entire family from Santa Fe to SoCal for tourist-friendly stops at Disneyland, Knott’s Berry Farm and, of course, Dodger Stadium.
 He pulled out his smartphone, gave a panoramic sweep of the entire area and sent a video message to his siblings about the summer of ’78 when he saw the boys in blue during their run to the World Series against the Yankees.
 “I can still point to every seat we sat in that night,” he said. “To come here as a kid and then come back like this, it’s amazing.”
 Now a mere four wins away from the celebration of a lifetime, one that would cap a bizarre year that seemed so impossible just a few short months ago, Porterfield is all about sharing it with the people back home. He still visits his parents and extended family a few times a year, a trip made that much easier with the job in Los Angeles and a full-time home in Arizona.
 “I’ve got a few more years in this business but, yeah, getting a ring right now after all this — that would be a lot of fun,” he said.
