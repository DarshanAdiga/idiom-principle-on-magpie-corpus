 Dear Barbara,
 It’s true if these cats are removed, the rodent population may increase. But let me stress to others to please not abandon your cats on the streets. When people abandon their cats, they are creating a community of cats that must rely on the kindness and resources of other people for their food, vaccinations, sterilizations and general pet care should they get ill or injured while living on the street.
 As you saw from the letter, people wanted to harm them and kill them. Street life is rough for a cat. Feral/community cats usually only live one-fourth to one-half of their average lifespans of 14 years.
