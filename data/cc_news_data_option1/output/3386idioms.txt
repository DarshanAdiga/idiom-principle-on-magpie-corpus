Carter gets a lot of referrals, so he seldom has time for walk-ins. Lately, he's been giving a lot of pixie cuts.
 “I've always specialized in short hair. My ability is to make short hair look good on a woman,” said Carter.
 A couple of chairs down is another award-winner. Tyron Knight goes by TK, and while he’s been a professional barber since 2016, he started cutting his brother’s and his own hair in the sixth grade.
 “It’s something I always did for free until college. Then I started charging $10 for a cut,” said Knight, 30. “It’s a second nature of mine. It’s a way to do art. I started out doing painting and drawing, but that didn’t work.”
 Knight likes to spend quality time on the haircut and with the client. He credits that to his being named Best Barber in the Best of Cherokee County Readers’ Choice Awards.
 “I book appointments for 30 minutes per person. Most do about 15-minute appointments,” said Knight. “Some people like that's fast money, but I don’t like to push people out of the seat.”
 Since he makes time for his clients, taking the extra minutes to do additional cleaning has been one of Knight’s biggest challenges during the pandemic. That and the four weeks the salon was closed.
 “I had some money saved up, so that wasn’t an issue. Emotionally, it did kind of affect me because I wasn’t able to cut hair or see people,” he said.
 After having 15 jobs since he was 15 years old, Knight is happy he ended up working at Vivid Salon.
 “This has been my best work place. The team is just amazing. I couldn’t feel more at home,” he said.
 Men’s hairstyles don’t tend to be as trendy as women’s, but Knight finds works to make clients happy. One popular style is a hard part with a combover. Another is having lines or designs cut in.
 “A lot of kids who come in ask for football numbers etched into their hair, or footballs or team logos,” said Knight.

ABU DHABI, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / WAM - 27th Aug, 2020) Hub71, a tech ecosystem powered by Mubadala Investment Company, has announced a partnership with Silicon Valley-based TechWadi, a non-profit organisation building meaningful connections and partnerships for entrepreneurs and investors across Silicon Valley and the MENA region.
 "This unique partnership further supports Abu Dhabi’s strategy of becoming a global tech ecosystem that encourages Hub71 startups to flourish", said Hub71 in a statement on Thursday.
 The Hub71 x TechWadi programme will allow for cross-border knowledge sharing, investment deal flow, and market-access for both ecosystems. US startups and Venture Capitals will gain priority access to Hub71’s ecosystem and incentive programme. Hub71 startups, in turn, will benefit by gaining direct access to US-based VCs within the TechWadi network, which includes the likes of Google Venture, 500Startups, Silicon Valley Bank as well as TechWadi network mentors from companies like Apple, Facebook, Google, Palantir, Salesforce, and others.
 Commenting on the partnership, Nader Museitif, Head of Partnerships and business Development of Hub71, said, "Our partnership with TechWadi creates value for both our international communities of founders as well as any US startups looking for growth opportunities in the middle East. Companies on both sides will gain support, access to capital and market opportunities to scale their businesses abroad. In our pursuit of staying ahead of the curve, we are continually assessing and improving our offering and quest to help startups to thrive."
 The programme, which launches today, will see US startups – who have chosen Abu Dhabi as their springboard for global growth – pitch for generous incentives such as free housing, health insurance and office space for up to three years, worth up to AED3 million in non-equity subsidies; as well as to gain access to market, capital, talent and a flexible regulatory framework.

Wellington, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 27th Aug, 2020 ) :Cyber attacks forced New Zealand's stock exchange to halt trading Thursday for the third time in as many days, its operator said Thursday, just as the country's corporate reporting season gets underway.
 The New Zealand Exchange (NZX) said the bourse was placed into a trading halt at about 11.10am local time "as a result of network connectivity issues relating to DDoS cyber security attacks".
 A distributed denial of service attack, commonly known as a "dee-dos" or DDoS, involves disrupting computer networks by flooding them with traffic.
 Temporary trading halts were ordered as a result, he added, with the market down from 3.

I reckon we can shave at least a week to ten days off of the four weeks it takes now to get goods to the US - if we had the deep sea port at Matarbari/Sonadia and could handle Panamax size large container carriers which can dock in that port. Panamax or larger size ships do not need to transship in ports like Singapore and add a week's delay to have containers transferred from ship to ship, These large ships can go straight from CTG to ports like Long Beach. NYC, Seattle or Rotterdam in the EU.
