The New Mexico Environment Department’s rule-making body voted Friday to add the so-called rapid response requirement to the state’s workforce safety regulations.
 The rule requires employers to report coronavirus infections to the state within four hours of being notified that an employee has tested positive for the virus.
 The Environment Department adopted the emergency rule in August and readopted it earlier this month.
 Friday’s vote by the Environmental Improvement Board codifies the requirement, which will replace the emergency rule once it is delivered to the state records administrator.
 “While the arrival of the vaccine is great news, we are not out of the woods yet,” Environment Secretary James Kenney said in a statement. “This amendment allows us to continue our critical work to ensure New Mexico workplaces are as safe as possible.”

Marcus Rashford has thrived under the coaching of a striker specialist, Mason Greenwood enthralled last season, when eight academy graduates debuted, and Bruno Fernandes is so totemic it is not blasphemous to mention him in the same breath as Eric Cantona.
 Signings are not chiselled on to the honours' board, though, and restoring silverware does not necessarily buy a United manager time, as Van Gaal has bitterly attested. Hoisting the Premier League trophy in May still seems fanciful for Solskjaer and there are such a myriad of nuances surrounding his role that mere qualification for the Champions League would not necessarily be reason enough to retain him into the last year of his contract. The (realistic) best case scenario would be a collection of cups whilst regaining Champions League status.

We can even see how it performs in games and some camera samples. The phone is obviously a pre-production device, with some parts covered by tape, and the software is not finished.

Kevin Loso, executive director of the Rutland Housing Authority said the project had been funded by some of the about $33 million of the CARES Act money received by Vermont from the federal government and channeled it through the Vermont Housing Conservation Board. However, Loso said the funding could not be used for certain development costs which was one of the benefits of the Rutland hospital’s fund drive.
 The campaign had some unusual challenges. The Bridge housing project was developed using CARES Act money, which had to be spent by the end of the year. And while fundraisers are not unusual for RRMC, this year because of the pandemic, many of the kinds of event that would bring people together for a charitable cause were not possible.
 Also Housing for Health got started in early October, which Moore said was later than the organizers intended.
 “We couldn’t do a lot of what we typically do when we kick off a campaign, which is to bring people together and create some educational opportunities, create an atmosphere where people understand what the need is and help to rally in support of that need,” Moore said.
 Moore said hospital staff created a grass-roots fundraising plan and worked with the RHA to create a volunteer campaign committee that met every week. Moore said the members reached out to people and businesses in the Rutland County area.
 According to Moore, many of them “stepped up immediately with very generous donations.”
 Housing for Health was the subject of RRMC’s fall appeal, Moore said.
 The committee’s efforts and the mailings were the two primary methods used to meet the goal.
 The Bridges project, has been built at the former Hendy Brothers John Deere dealership on Route 4 East, mostly, Loso said, because there was an opportunity that had to be seized quickly, and there weren’t many other sites that would meet the needs in the area.
 “I think everyone agrees that this was the most ambitious undertaking of any of the projects that are being constructed or developed around the state. Many areas converted motels into housing. But really, no one essentially started from scratch. We had an empty shell,” he said.

 # Insights for us from “The Plague” by Albert Camus
 The McDonough County Voice
 As Americans face the most devastating period of the coronavirus pandemic, I can’t help recalling a famous novel by French writer Albert Camus, which depicts a similar desperate situation—and the public response to it. “The Plague” appeared in 1947, and it has been regarded as a major literary achievement ever since.
 Camus (1913-1960) was born and raised in Algiers and became a journalist, essayist, and playwright as well as a novelist. He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957. Among his world-famous novels is “The Stranger” (1942), an insightful account of alienation in human experience during the 20th century. “The Plague” is thematically related in that it depicts struggle, disconnection, and the need for social concern.
 Camus sets his novel in Oran, a French port of about 200,000 people, on the Algerian coast. The central figure is Dr. Bernard Rieux, who recognizes some evidence of an epidemic when rats start dying throughout the city—and then one of his patients dies from a new infection. It eventually becomes clear that the rats had been infected by fleas, which now were transferring to people. And as the novel says, “in a very few days the number of cases had risen by leaps and bounds,” and every informed observer realizes that “a real epidemic had set in.”
 As the number of deaths rapidly climbs, the local public finds it difficult to cope with their circumstances, in a psychological sense, for they are “wrapped up in themselves” and do not want to recognize “anything like plague, which rules out any future, cancels journeys, and silences the exchange of views.” In other words, they traditionally saw themselves as “free,” living their purpose-filled, socially active lives, and now, “they had to be content to live only for the day, alone under the vast indifference of the sky.”
 Of course, the community leaders act to establish new regulations for public safety. Residents are forbidden to leave Oran, for example, so people cannot just come and go—which tends to isolate the townspeople. Moreover, “the plague forces inactivity upon them, limiting their movements to the same dull round inside the town. . . .”
 As that suggests, the plague slowly fosters social disconnection, for “in this extremity of solitude no one could count on any help from his neighbor, and each had to bear the load of his troubles alone.” Moreover, “people suffered from being deprived of the company of friends.”
 Of course, this circumstance in “The Plague” reminds us of the American situation today, where social disconnection is having an impact, and many people feel lonely and are unhappy about their limited daily routine.
 The famous novel also depicts the rebellion of some people against the new limitations, “as personal interests continue to occupy the foreground of their thoughts.” In other words, selfishness arose, and among such people, “Their first reaction . . . was to abuse the authorities.” They want “the regulations [to] be modified and made less stringent.” So, the greater public good is resisted by some individuals, just as our mask-wearing and social- distancing regulations have met with firm resistance by some Americans and have fostered criticism of mayors, governors, and medical authorities who realize that such regulations are necessary to handle the Covid-19.
 The novel’s central figure, Dr. Rieux, is akin to the highly praised healthcare responders in America who devote themselves to the hard task of saving as many people as they can. Of course, he risks his own life to both save others and mitigate their suffering, yet he doesn’t view himself as a hero. As he tells a friend, “the only means of fighting a plague is common decency,” or in other words, helping others—which for him simply means “doing my job.”
 In the middle of the novel, a Catholic priest named Father Paneloux tries to make religious sense out of the epidemic by proclaiming that “the plague is the flail of God,” somehow expressing divine upset with the depravity and indifference of modern society. But Dr. Rieux disagrees. He has seen people die from the plague, including a child, and he doesn’t see the hand of God behind it all—nor does he find any meaning in the random suffering and death. As he explains to the minister, “We’re working side by side for something that unites us—beyond blasphemy and prayers.” The minister eventually joins his band of workers.
 The doctor’s humanity is expressed in his view of the common purpose that was drawing people together, to continue the great effort to save lives. As he says, “What I hate is death and disease,” and “we’re all allies, facing them and fighting them together.” And the underlying personal quality that motivates him is sympathy for the plague’s victims, for “there was not one of their anxieties which he did not share, and no predicament of theirs that was not his.”
 After experiencing enormous stress and exhaustion, Dr. Rieux also faces two personal tragedies. His close friend, Jean Tarrou, who had created a voluntary group of helpers to assist in caring for the plague victims, comes down with the disease. As Dr. Rieux sees him in a hospital bed, he feels helpless: “This human form [Tarrou] . . . was lacerated by the spear-thrusts of the plague, consumed by searing, superhuman fires,” lying there “in the dark flood of the pestilence,” and the doctor realizes that “he could do nothing to avert the wreck.” Indeed, his friend soon dies. To make things worse, on the following morning, Dr. Rieux’s wife dies as well.
 Late in the novel, the stricken community faces the Christmas season—just as we are doing now—but as the narrator says, “Christmas that year had none of its old-time associations; it smacked of hell rather than of heaven.” There were “empty, unlighted shops,” “cheerless streets,” “streetcars laden with listless, dispirited passengers,” and so on.
 But after many thousands of deaths, and through public effort, the plague eventually declines, and the town recovers.
 The reader learns at the end that Dr. Rieux himself compiled the chronicle of the epidemic in Oran—so he was the narrator of “The Plague,” as well as the central figure. And he did so to ”bear witness in favor of those plague- stricken people.” He had two purposes. One was to reveal “that there are more things to admire in men than to despise.” In other words, people can be selfish and conflictive, but many can also pull together and exert themselves for the common good. And his other purpose was to remind people down through time that “the plague bacillus never dies or disappears for good,” so the public must be prepared for future struggles.
 Of course, those are two great messages that, hopefully, will emerge from the American, and world, struggle against the ravages of Covid-19. Don’t dismiss such health threats as minor and inconsequential; be forever ready to confront them. And when one arises, don’t complain about wearing masks or avoiding social gatherings. Pull together for the common good. The coronavirus is further evidence that our nation is divided between well-informed, committed individuals and many others, who remain self-concerned—and are yet to learn and grow.

 "I have been locked down, both at work and at home," Aucker mused. "I have not been around anyone that had it. I don't know where I picked it up, no idea."
 Aucker shared her story with the Evangelical Community Hospital workforce, in part to encourage those who have battled the virus and to allay the fears of caregivers who think they will get it.
 "It is a virus," she added. "You can do everything right and still get it."
 Aucker returned to work on the day the first vaccines came out. It is a hope for the future, she said, and people needed to consider getting immunized.
 Having tested positive for COVID-19, Aucker said she would wait a recommended 90 days before getting the vaccine.

Corona Regional Medical Center southeast of Los Angeles has converted an old emergency room to help handle nearly double the usual number of ICU patients. It’s using space in two disaster tents to triage ER patients because the emergency room is filled with patients who need to be hospitalized.
 Ambulances can sit for two hours unless they are bringing in patients with critical, life-or-death emergencies.
 “There’s no room at the inn, so to speak,” hospital chief executive Mark Uffer said. “Literally every nook and cranny of the hospital is being used.”
 It’s a scene playing out across California. According to state data Friday, all of Southern California and the 12-county San Joaquin Valley to the north had exhausted their regular intensive care unit capacity and some hospitals have begun using “surge” space.

Depending on one's perception of management, Solskjaer has handled Paul Pogba more tactfully than Jose Mourinho and not backed himself into a corner, or weakened his standing in the eyes of supporters wistfully longing for Ferguson's ruthlessness. Pogba is approaching the endgame at United and, whether he is feckless or phenomenal in matches, will have a bearing on whether Solskjaer stays beyond the summer.
 The imminence of the January window and United's flattering position in the league suggest Solskjaer is certain of seeing out the season, or at least the majority of it, depending on whether the Moyes precedent still stands. His popularity within the club is at least equal to the crowdpleasing Van Gaal's and Solskjaer's transfer hit-rate is arguably unrivalled at the two-year stint.

 "We have gone through structural changes all across the club that obviously has shaken the club big time. I would say the highlights of that year is the two trophies that we won together.

As a way of getting "our system implemented," Los Angeles Lakers coach Frank Vogel said before his team played the Phoenix Suns on Friday night, he has made sure that "we really dove deep into the film" after all their exhibition games.
 It worked for the Lakers last season, leading them to the NBA championship under tough circumstances of having to play games in the NBA bubble in Florida after the league restarted the season that was halted because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 So with the coronavirus still raging and testing protocols still in place, Vogel returned to film to teach while the Lakers were in Phoenix for the last three days.
 "This is a unique situation with the point-of-care testing. It's tough to deal with that in the morning and still get guys over to the arena for practice," Vogel said on a pregame videoconference. "We haven't had a shootaround or a practice on this trip, so it has been really important for us to learn in the film room and getting everybody connected and we've had some success with carryover. What we talk about in our film is carrying out onto the court and hopefully that continues tonight."
 The plan was for LeBron James and Anthony Davis to play in their second straight exhibition game and for their time to increase as they ramp it up before the season starts Tuesday against the Los Angeles Clippers at Staples Center.

“There’s no room at the inn, so to speak,” hospital chief executive Mark Uffer said. “Literally every nook and cranny of the hospital is being used.”
 It’s a scene playing out across California. According to state data Friday, all of Southern California and the 12-county San Joaquin Valley to the north had exhausted their regular intensive care unit capacity and some hospitals have begun using “surge” space.
 In hard-hit Fresno County in Central California, a new 50-bed alternate care site opened Friday near the community Regional Medical Center. The beds for COVID-19-negtive patients will free up space in area hospitals, where just 13 of some 150 ICU beds were available Friday, said Dan Lynch, the county’s emergency medical services director.
 Lynch said he expects they will have to use the Fresno Convention Center, which can accommodate up to 250 patients, given current demand.
 Fresno and three neighboring counties also have taken the unprecedented step of sending paramedics on emergency calls to evaluate people. They won’t be taken to the emergency room if they could go to an urgent care facility or wait a few days to talk to their doctors, Lynch said.
 Some hospitals have cancelled non-essential elective surgeries, such as hip replacements, that might require beds which may soon be needed for COVID-19 patients. Others are increasing staff hours or moving patients to free up space.

 The race was decided when American Magic put in a bad tack near the first gate at the top of the course and plunged off the foils, losing all speed.
