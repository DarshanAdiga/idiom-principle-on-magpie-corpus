When a coaching staff and key players don’t know each other well—quarterback Teddy Bridgewater, for instance, has never met the assistant he’ll be joined at the hip with this year, QB coach Jake Peetz—the communication via videoconference is vital. NFL rules mandate that teams and veterans can meet virtually for only two hours per day, four days per week. So those eight hours a week are gold. With the Panthers, offensive coordinator Joe Brady, 30, and Peetz 37, are spending about three more hours per day by videoconference going over scheme and plays and the minutiae that guys coaching together for the first time just have to get right. On Friday, Rhule jumped into their Microsoft Teams videoconference three times as they try to design a new offense with a new quarterback.

DELAND, Fla. (AP) — Deputies in Florida said they were hit with cups of alcohol, bottles and bar stools after they made arrests at a weekend block party involving thousands of party-goers, officials reported Monday. The Volusia County Sheriff's Office estimated 3,000 people were at the outdoor party spanning several locations in DeLand that started Saturday afternoon and lasted until early Sunday. Two men were arrested for possession of a weapon by a convicted felon, tampering with evidence, inciting a riot and resisting an officer without violence. During the arrests, two deputies were hit with a cup of alcohol, another deputy was sucker-punched by a man who fled and another deputy and a DeLand police officer were hit with a bar stool and Mason jar, according to the sheriff's office. Glass bottles were thrown at patrol vehicles while the arrests were made. A deputy injured his knee, and an police officer who was hit by a jar had a minor head injury, the sheriff's office said. A passenger in a vehicle pointed a rifle or shotgun in the direction of a deputy and pedestrians gathered at a gas station, according to the sheriff's office. Some party-goers said they were targeted because the crowd was largely African American, but Sheriff Mike Chitwood said in a news release that the actions by deputies were aimed at keeping the public safe. Deputies were at the block party for crowd control and to keep cars from blocking traffic, not for enforcing social distancing as a result of the coronavirus, the sheriff's office said. “How are we supposed to turn a blind eye to someone pointing a gun at a crowd, or two convicted felons exchanging a loaded gun right in front of our face?\" Chitwood said.

"Our young group of core players are excited about him being our manager," Royals outfielder Bubba Starling said. "We can't wait to see what he has to offer to us and we can't wait to play behind him."
 ROOKIES TO WATCH
 There are a handful of position players worth monitoring in the minors, but the arms will capture most of the attention. The quartet of Brady Singer, Jackson Kowar, Daniel Lynch and Kris Bubic are the future of the Royals rotation.
 " They're all they're made up to be. We're ready for them, ready to see what they can do," Royals outfielder Whit Merrifield said. "I hope they're preparing to come to spring and fight for a job."
 THEY'RE SET
 Just about every position is set heading into spring training. Alex Gordon will join Merrifield and Dozier in the outfield with Starling providing depth. Jorge Soler will be back as an outfielder and designated hitter. Maikel Franco takes over at third base with Mondesi, Lopez and first baseman Ryan O'Hearn finishing off the infield. Salvador Perez will be back behind the plate after missing all of last season due to Tommy John surgery.
 THEY'RE NOT
 Four spots in the starting rotation are likely set with Brad Keller and Danny Duffy joining Jakob Junis and Mike Montgomery, but the fifth spot is up for grabs. The Royals also need some bullpen arms to lock down jobs after the entire relief corps — except closer Ian Kennedy — struggling last season.
 ON DECK
 What fans can look forward to in spring training? How about sunshine and warmth after a cold, snowy winter in Kansas City. The Royals fully realize that this is likely going to be another year of growth, and that makes taking a lot of lumps. So fans are best off enjoying the weather, the scenery and the games rather than fretting too much over wins and losses.

For that reason, Sanchez would be required to reduce Pawlowski’s sentence to 19 months, the time he has served since he was sentenced in October 2018. Sanchez said such a reduction would be inappropriate.


  “In imposing sentence, the court found a significant period of incarceration was required not only in light of the seriousness of the public corruption offenses in this case but also to promote respect for the law and send a strong message of deterrence,” Sanches said. “Reducing the 180-month sentence imposed to 19 months would undermine these goals.”


  He also noted that it would mean Pawlowski would serve less time behind bars than his campaign manager, Mike Fleck, who pleaded guilty to bribery and tax offenses. Fleck was sentenced to five years, which he is serving in a federal prison in West Virginia.


  Sanchez said the federal Bureau of Prisons has authority to furlough prisoners, adding that nothing in his opinion is intended to preclude or discourage the bureau from doing so for Pawlowski.


  Pawlowski’s wife, Lisa, responded Monday saying that she was not surprised by Sanchez’s decision and that her husband would pursue other avenues for release, including an appeal.


  “Judge Sanchez could have saved a life today. After witnessing his original sentence, I had no confidence that he would have a change of mind or heart,” Lisa Pawlowski said in a written statement.


  She noted a federal judge in Connecticut last week ruled in favor of prisoners in a class action lawsuit directing the warden of the federal prison in Danbury to speed up the process of evaluating prisoners for home confinement.


  Pawlowski, who is appealing his conviction and sentence, asked the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to grant him bail during the coronavirus outbreak. The appeals court denied his request March 31, allowing him to renew it if conditions changed. He refiled the motion April 2, but the appeals court again denied it May 4 on grounds that Pawlowski does not meet the conditions for bail pending appeal.

Rhule has a seven-year contract, and so he’s concentrating on building a strong foundation.

Meanwhile, McGeachin is isolating herself politically by aligning with a vocal minority of Idahoans, many of them alt-right transplants from California, who are more interested in fomenting rage and racism than solving the real problems Idahoans care about. A statewide poll commissioned by the Idaho Association of Commerce & Industry found more than 75% of Idahoans approve of Little’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly 80% support the governor’s four-stage “Idaho Rebounds” plan for reopening our economy, and the poll found particularly strong support among Republicans.
 Idahoans are not yet in the clear from this invisible enemy, and taking personal responsibility for social distancing will be required until there is a vaccine. That may take years. As I write, there are nearly 4.5 million infected people globally, and more than 85,000 deaths in the United States - more than the Vietnam War. COVID-19 spreads through respiratory droplets, in highest concentrations when people cough or sneeze, but it can also be transmitted through breathing while talking, or when saliva touches a surface or the air. Because people with no symptoms can carry and spread the virus, until there is a vaccine, no one is safe. We must mitigate our risk by following public health guidelines and working together as communities and as a state. In the meantime, businesses of all sizes should take advantage of the state and federal resources available to them at commerce.idaho.gov/covid-19/.

We should never encourage prosecutors to get creative. It is a bedrock constitutional requirement that criminal statutes be phrased in wording clear enough to put a person of average intelligence on notice of what is prohibited. When prosecutors push the envelope, they flout this principle. When they target for prosecution behavior that is not really within the ambit of what the cited penal statute was meant to proscribe, they usurp Congress’s authority to write the laws. I was vocally critical of this shoddy practice during the Mueller investigation, in which aggressive prosecutors stretched the concept of “conspiracy against the United States” (purportedly derived from a statute criminalizing conspiracy _to defraud_ the United States) in order to prosecute conduct Congress had not actually criminalized.

In the Trump–Russia probe, Trump officials were charged with felony false-statements for trivial alleged misrepresentations that in no way impeded the ability of investigators to seek the truth. If the Justice Department is going to endorse the prosecutions brought by the special counsel, then it cannot turn a blind eye to misrepresentations by law- enforcement officials.

For example, the Community Expo that usually takes place in April was moved to September. Still up in the air, according to Compe, is DeForest’s annual 4th of July celebration. Compe said a Community Freedom Celebration could be held later.
 “We’re crossing our fingers that we can still hold events,” said Compe.
 Compe’s been spending a lot of time on social media, getting COVID-19 information out through as many avenues as possible, such as Linked-In and Facebook. The chamber has even started an Instagram page.
 “My daughters are teaching me,” said Compe, with a laugh. She explained that one of the chamber’s board members put together a Linked-In page for the chamber.
 “I appreciate all the help,” said Compe.
 She also is impressed by the creativity of local businesses. The Supporting Hands Poker Game is currently up and running. It is planned to go from May 1-29. Eight participating businesses are handing out a playing card with every receipt. At the end of every week, participants are asked to show their hands, and the winner gets $25 in Chamber Bucks to be spent at participating businesses.
 Compe also talked about the Village of DeForest’s virtual bingo, which encourages residents to get out on local trails and do different activities to match with squares on the village’s website. To complete a square, participants have to take a picture of themselves or their families completing the tasks. Score sheets are submitted by a certain date and then winners are drawn for prizes.
 Compe has marveled at the resiliency of the community and its ability to adjust to changes throughout the COVID-19 ordeal. An example she cited is the school district’s quick transition to virtual learning and the plans its making for graduation.
 “It’s all about making the best of the situation,” said Compe.

Not only did Tesla pull a profit in the first quarter of 2020, but its battery partner Panasonic said on Monday its battery business recorded earnings in the black, too, for the second time. Now, Gigafactory 1, based in Nevada, could see an expansion.
 Reuters first reported on the possible capacity expansion at the plant during its first-quarter earnings call. Panasonic Chief Financial Officer Hirokazu Umeda specifically said the company was "in discussions right now" to expand work at the facility. Although the company is no longer Tesla's exclusive battery provider (the company works with LG Chem in China), the partnership has blossomed in recent years and recorded two profitable quarters.
 Overall demand for Tesla's cars likely helped push the battery business into profitable territory. Umeda mentioned demand is beyond the current capacity of 35 gigawatts per year.

“And he has jokes on (the iPad) and he loves to do those,” Stodola said. “If you get to know him, he’s very hilarious.”


  Joey grew up in Waterloo and attended the local schools. With his familiarity with Waterloo, and the fact people in the community know who he is, Stodola said it was important for him to work locally.


  “We’ll even be going for walks and people who are complete strangers to me will say, ‘Hey, Joey,’ and I’ll have no idea who they are, but they know him,” she said.


  The path to opening Traveling Joe started six years ago “before there was Instacart and curbside pick-up,” Stodola said. The business needed to get through some red tape before it could open. Despite the delay, she said it was worth the wait as the state provided 90% of the start-up costs and paid to hire a consultant to assist with launching the business.


  “We had an amazing team and it just took longer than I wanted it to,” she said, noting there were multiple people involved with creating Traveling Joe.


  Another slight roadblock was that when the idea for the business was approached, Joey was still in high school. Under Wisconsin law, people with disabilities are allowed to attend public school until the age of 21. Stodola said her son’s teacher was on-board with allowing Joey – who was classified as a junior six years ago – to leave school to operate his business.


  “When she heard that idea … (Joey) would start taking orders from his teachers,” she said.


  Traveling Joe’s first customers were residents of Hawthorne Senior Apartments in Waterloo, where his grandfather lives. The timing was impeccable as many of the seniors at that time were being advised against going to the store due to coronavirus.


  In the past two months, word of mouth has helped the business grow. Now people can contact Joey for his services by visiting his website, www.traveling-joe.com or by calling 608-577-9377. There is a $10 flat fee for orders less than $100 and a 10% charge for orders over $100 based on the total; for example, a $120 order would have a $12 fee.


  Mary Stodola said typically, once orders are placed by customers, the pair goes shopping (for now, Joey does not go shopping due to COVID-19). Joey then separates the items into bins and then bags the items for customers. On delivery day, the groceries are delivered by the business owner, who uses a big red wagon to bring the items to the customer’s door. The customer is then presented an invoice and the receipt for the groceries.


  She is excited to see her son have his own business and knows it makes him feel important to contribute to the community.


  “I say I’m proud of him, but I’m always proud of Joey and this gives him a nice routine” Stodola said. “And if he were to ever move out, he can take this business with him.”

Discussions will continue Tuesday on the Crossville city budget for 2020-’21.
 City Council members hope to have a better picture on health insurance costs than was portrayed during the initial May 14 teleconferencing session.
 “It’s looking like this whole insurance deal needs to be relooked at,” noted Mayor James Mayberry as officials looked over the initial projections.
 An estimate of 10% over present costs was plugged in to account for anticipated premium increases. City Manager Greg Wood explained this is done because the actual amount will not be known until after the budget is enacted.
 “Since we don’t know the number, we err on the side of caution,” he said. “We did very good this year. Hopefully, it’ll repeat next year.”
 Elective medical procedures were put on hold for a few weeks due to the COVID-19 crisis. That move by Gov. Bill Lee is reflected in the city’s health insurance.
 “Unless we had some patients with the coronavirus, our costs have gone down significantly,” Wood said.
 The council was discussing the $46,000 amount for the legislative board — the mayor and the four-member council — when concerns about health insurance costs arose.
 “Don’t you think that employee health insurance number could drop $10,000 pretty easy?” Mayberry asked.
 Wood agreed to plug in $37,400 to allow room for an increase. The actual cost for 2018-’19 was $34,090.
 The next line item was for city court, where council member J.H. Graham III suggested decreasing the Wood’s $7,500 projection health insurance by $1,000.
 “I think, based on what has happened, I think ever if there was a year of no increase, I think it would be this year,” said council member Scot Shanks.
 Added council member Art Gernt, who works in the insurance field, “That’s assuming the health care costs stay the same. With everything that’s been going on, I have no idea which direction that could go.”
 Central staff insurance, however, was projected to be $100 lower than this year. Then the council moved on to the IT Department.
 “They god almighty,” Graham proclaimed. “How many people are in the IT Department?”
 When Wood replied that it was a staff of two, Graham responded, “And their employee health insurance is $33,000? Yeah, we’re going to have to take a look at that health insurance, aren’t we?”
 Tuesday's teleconference meeting will start at 4:30 p.m. Visit crossvilletn.legistar.com to view the meeting online.

Former Barcelona midfielder Alex Song has revealed he knew he would not play first-team football for the club but he signed because “I would be a millionaire.”
 The Cameroon international joined the Catalan giants from Arsenal in the summer of 2012 for a transfer fee reported to be £15m.
 Song has clocked up 215 appearances across six years at the Gunners and had become an increasingly prominent player for Arsene Wenger’s team in a deep- lying midfield role.
 He penned a five-year contract at the Camp Nou and while he made 65 appearances for the Blaugrana, it was condensed into two seasons and he joined West Ham in the summer of 2014.
 Song subsequently had brief stints at Rubin Kazan in Russia and Swiss side Sion, but he had his contract terminated last year after refusing to lower his salary.
 Now aged 32, Song is a free agent and reflected back at his time at the Blaugrana where he won the league title in 2012-13 campaign.
 “When Barcelona offered me a contract and I saw how much I would earn, I did not think twice,” Song said on Instagram Live, as cited by Diario Sport. “I felt that my wife and children should have a comfortable life once I retire.

"We like our team. It's a fun team and a good group," general manager Dayton Moore said. "There's a lot to be excited about. The new ownership, as we've talked about, is very encouraging and exciting. We can't wait. I'm heading down to spring training two weeks earlier than I ever have before."
 The Royals went through significant growing pains last season, but part of that was because so many young position players were getting hard-fought experience. Among them were third baseman-turned-outfielder Hunter Dozier, slick-fielding second baseman Nicky Lopez and shortstop Adalberto Mondesi, one of the best talents to come through in years.
 What was missing was the pitching, and it still won't be there most of this season. But with a full rotation worth of young arms in the pipeline, some of whom could arrive by September, there is optimism even in that department.
 "I heard it early on that these guys are hungry. They want to be pushed," Matheny said. "I think they're very grateful for how well Ned protected this group. But I think they're ready for another expectation. Be careful what you wish for. Let's put it out there. Let's go. Let's chase excellence."

 Matheny was the other big change. His managerial career spiraled downhill with the St. Louis Cardinals. He spent time on self-betterment during a year working as an adviser to the Royals, and one of his first orders of business was to meet with every player on the team before the season.

When Eric Kiesau was promoted from wide receivers coach to offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach in January, he sat down with quarterback Hank Bachmeier to watch video together of a game last season.
 Kiesau was focused on Bachmeier’s demeanor, footwork and mechanics in what amounted to an introductory meeting between the two as they got to know each other better as a player and coach.
 One play in particular brought a question from his new position coach.
 “I said ‘what were you thinking here?’” Kiesau said. “He said ‘coach, I had so many things on my mind that I couldn’t really think.’”
 Bachmeier went 7-1 as the starter as a true freshman, passing for 1,879 yards and nine touchdowns to six interceptions. His 407 passing yards in the season opener at Florida State were the most by a Boise State quarterback in his first start since the program joined the FBS level in 1996.
 The talent, instincts and play-making ability were all clearly there. His decision-making, at times, wasn’t — which would result in big hits due to staying in the pocket too long or refusing to slide while scrambling.
 Bachmeier won his first six starts to help the Broncos start 6-0 and climb in the top 25 rankings, but suffered an injury that forced him to miss a loss to BYU. He returned to start in a win against San Jose State, but left with a different injury and missed the final four games of the regular season and the Mountain West title game.
 He returned somewhat controversially to start the Las Vegas Bowl against Washington despite not taking a snap in seven weeks. And he predictably struggled, passing for just 119 yards and tossing two crucial interceptions in a 38-7 loss.
 With the whirlwind debut season behind him – the Las Vegas Bowl was barely eight months from his senior prom — the Broncos are hoping Bachmeier can take what he learned on the fly and apply it to his second year this fall.
 “Now he has eight games where he can go back and reflect and watch himself and really correct what needs to be corrected,” Kiesau said. “He can take a deep breath and evaluate what he did and correct some things he wants to get better at."
 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has made things a bit tougher for Kiesau and Bachmeier to work together this spring, but they’ve done what they can through video conferencing, text messages and phone calls. The two worked together previously, but the quarterback-offensive coordinator relationship is one that must work for an offense to be successful.
 And that’s why Kiesau emailed Bachmeier with a homework assignment.
 “I wanted him to kind of prioritize some things offensively on what he likes and what he enjoys and the plays he likes to get to and, conversely, the plays he doesn’t like,” Kiesau said. “I said ‘hey just because you don’t like them it doesn’t mean we’re not going to call them,' but it’s good to know the guy running the offense, the plays he likes and feels comfortable with.”
 While Bachmeier is the presumed starter, Chase Cord likely will push for playing time and have a role with the offense. Cord made two starts last season but appeared in eight games, mostly with a package of plays as a dual- threat option. He passed for 670 yards and nine touchdowns while tossing three interceptions.

Panasonic did not immediately return a request for comment on expanded capacity at the Gigafactory, nor did Tesla.
 The executive also appeared to suggest new batteries in the pipeline for Tesla vehicles, which has become a hot topic as of recent. Last week, reports surfaced suggesting Tesla's rumored "million-mile battery" could debut soon before it rolls out in China. The longer-life battery would nix cobalt usage and be more affordable to produce, perhaps bringing EVs to cost parity with gasoline-powered vehicles. A version for North America was also mentioned.
 However, work on this battery supposedly took place with China's CATL, not Panasonic. But, there's always the possibility for more battery breakthroughs.

Both Quincy High soccer programs will have new leaders in the fall.
 Daniel Mongo replaces 10-year coach Mark Spendlove on the boys' side, and Bridget Coleman replaces six-year coach Seth Harmon on the girls' side.
 Quincy High Athletic Director Kevin Mahoney is excited for the new varsity duo.
 "On the boys side, they graduated 17 seniors last year," said Mahoney. "So it's going to be a bit of a rebuild, and Dan, we felt, is someone who is going to bring in a lot of energy to build up that program.
 "For Bridget, she has a ton of experience coaching, working at both North Quincy's program and our program for (junior varsity). She knows the girls, the girls connect well with her. She has the ability to connect with the kids and continue to grow the program on the girls' side."
 Both Spendlove and Harmon decided to step down after last season. Spendlove's boys team qualified for the postseason five times since 2011, although they were never able to advance. The girls program is in a long playoff drought.
 Players won't have to say goodbye to their former coaches completely, though. Spendlove still works as a security guard at Quincy High, and Harmon is a teacher.
 While there's nothing but admiration and respect between Mahoney and the former coaches, there is plenty of newfound confidence and energy heading into the 2020 fall season.
 "It will certainly be new, but I think they'll both be up to the challenge," Mahoney said of Coleman and Mongo. "I'm excited to see where the programs are headed. They're two programs that have a ton of skill and a ton of promise and with both of them we can make some things happen in the Patriot League."
 Both Mongo and Coleman are no strangers to city soccer. Mongo played for Quincy under Spendlove, graduating in 2012. Coleman played for North Quincy, graduating in 2007.
 Mongo, a UMass graduate, will be in his first full year of teaching technology and engineering at Quincy after previously working as a substitute.
 "I'm most excited about the opportunity to continue building the success and reputation of Quincy High soccer," Mongo said of continuing Spendlove's work. "Because when I first started playing soccer for Quincy, we were somewhat of a joke to some, but now that's no longer the case."
 Although the Quincy boys missed the playoffs this past season, the Presidents were 13-4-2 in 2018, finishing runner-up in the Patriot League Fisher Division with All-State forward Edson Fernandes.
 The boys will sport a fairly young roster, but Mongo is hoping that will give him more time to build chemistry with the team after working as a volunteer assistant under Spendlove for the past three years. Mongo was working a desk job while volunteering for the team, but he soon realized that his passion was on the field with the players and not in the office. Spendlove gave Mongo his first official coaching gig in 2017, when he took over as the freshman coach.
 "It was at that moment that I realized after spending all this time and energy thinking about my team, it was clear to me that this is where my focus needs to be," said Mongo. "I'm ready to get to work, and I know they feel the same way."
 Like Mongo, Coleman is also very familiar with Quincy High. Although she attended rival North Quincy and was a Raiders assistant coach for two years after college, she began coaching JV soccer at Quincy High three years ago and has since rooted herself in the QHS culture.
 Last year the Presidents went 5-12-1, but Coleman is confident in the future of the girls team.
 "I'm looking forward to building up the program with the ninth grade coming in," said Coleman, who played Division III soccer at DePauw University in Indiana. "I want to build it up and keep the girls engaged and excited about soccer.
 "I think there's a ton of talent (here), and more importantly a lot of heart. I'm just always excited to be a part of a team, no matter what level, and I think it's a really special program I get to be a part of."

Having watched the hardball investigators played against Trump associates, Trump partisans want comeuppance. It is natural, especially for the non- lawyers among them, to maintain that there is no satisfactory form of accountability other than criminal prosecution. Nevertheless, we must bear in mind, no matter how difficult doing so may be, that we react so negatively to the use of investigative processes as a political weapon because _it is wrong_.
