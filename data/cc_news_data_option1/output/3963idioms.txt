Rick Moranis is recovering following a street attack in New York City.      The Honey, I Shrunk the Kids star was shaken up after he was punched in the head in an unprovoked assault on the Upper West Side on Thursday morning.      Police officials are reviewing surveillance video that captured the moment a stranger approached Moranis, as he was leaving his Central Park West apartment building, lashed out, and knocked the reclusive star to the ground.      Moranis was hospitalised after complaining of pain in his head, back and right hip. He has since filed a police report.      The suspect, who was caught on camera running away from the scene, has not been identified or apprehended.      Moranis is making his long-awaited return to acting with the follow-up to his beloved 1989 family film Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.      The actor, who also starred in such classics as Ghostbusters, The Flintstones, and Spaceballs, has reportedly joined forces with bosses at Disney for the venture. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the film's original director, Joe Johnston, and actor Josh Gad are also on board.      Moranis stepped away from the spotlight in 1997 to raise his children.      His famous fans were quick to respond to the news of his beatdown on Friday, with Chris Evans and Ryan Reynolds taking to social media to comment.      "My blood is boiling," Evans wrote. "Find this man. You don't touch Rick Moranis."      And Reynolds added: "Should have known not to subject Rick to the year 2020. Glad to hear he's okay."

NATICK -- An effort to bring the first affordable-housing project for military veterans to MetroWest appears to have hit a bit of a snag, but those involved in discussions about the project say the challenge is not insurmountable.
 A land swap is needed to move the $21 million Wilson Gardens development forward, and there are questions about how that's going to happen.
    Natick could become home to the first affordable-housing development for military veterans in MetroWest  
 Supporters want to use about half of the Henry Wilson Memorial Park at the corner of Mill and West Central streets as the site of the four-story housing development. That means a portion of the park's 2.25 acres of open space will be lost. Other parcels in Natick containing open space must then be used to compensate the town for the loss, according to state law.
 The West Natick Fire Station is among the parcels originally targeted for compensation. But it's too small, said Randy Johnson, chairman of the Natick Affordable Housing Trust Fund, the driving force behind the project. The fire station is slated to be torn down to make way for a park, with a new station to be built beside it.
 A second site identified for potential compensation is 69-R Bacon St. However, that half-acre parcel may not be a good fit, said Matthew Gardner, chairman of the Natick Conservation Commission.
 It offers limited open space appeal, Gardner said, especially because it doesn't border properties that could expand recreation and leisure options.
 He said it might be time for the trust to think outside the box to find replacement open space. That could include taking over a property with a delinquent tax bill or signing a long-term lease with a private property owner.
 Johnson welcomes the suggestions.
 "Anything that works strikes our fancy," he said.
 The first step to build momentum for the project, according to Johnson, is to get annual Town Meeting -- set to start Oct. 20 -- to support a trust- sponsored warrant article. It asks the Select Board to petition state lawmakers to craft special legislation to allow construction of affordable housing for veterans on a section of Wilson Park. The park is owned by the town of Natick.
 The second part of the article is the land swap, and those details can eventually be worked out, both Johnson and Gardner said.
 Target date for completion of Wilson Gardens is 2026, according to a team of graduate students at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who developed a preliminary design.
 Johnson thinks that date is possible.
 Gardner, the Conservation Commission chairman, said it could be a "multi-year effort."
 "This is the first shot at this," he said. "It's going to take time to sort out the details."

Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers has urged caution after the Foxes’ fast start.


  They have won their opening three Premier League games ahead of Sunday’s visit of West Ham.


  Leicester beat West Brom and Burnley before last weekend’s stunning 5-2 win at Manchester City, where Jamie Vardy scored a hat-trick.


  They are one of the early pacesetters but Rodgers, who guided the Foxes to fifth last season, knows there is a long way to go.


  “If you come back to me with three games to go and we’re in the same position I’d be a tad more excited but we couldn’t have started any better,” he said.


  “It’s the levels of our performance and the types of performances which is pleasing. Against West Brom we had to be patient and our speed and quality came through, against Burnley you have to be physical and we came through that.


  “We went to Man City and played a slightly different way to how we wanted to. People look at it as a counter-attacking performance but none of our goals were counter-attacking. They came from pressing and playing through Man City’s press.

He’d been posting his songs to YouTube, but, unknown to him, someone else had edited “Laxed” down to a catchy snippet, and TikTok lit the match. Not long after, Jason Derulo recorded a version with lyrics, and after some behind-the- scenes back and forth, an official version of that song, now titled “Savage Love (Laxed — Siren Beat),” went on to become a global smash, topping charts in New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Britain and more. Currently, it sits at No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100.


  “Laxed” is both modern and traditional — the pacing and melody are indebted to Polynesian music, and also classic reggae. (Laxed is short for relaxed.) But its texture is specifically of the moment — each note sounds as if it had been sucked through a glitchy vortex and spit back out.


  Which in a way, they had been. “Laxed” was also an arrival on the world stage for siren jams — an emergent scene filled with producers specializing in music suited for blasting through sirens attached to the front of cars and bicycles. It’s a recent youth culture phenomenon in Pacific Islander, or Pasifika, communities in New Zealand and surrounding areas.


  “My siren jam is somehow the most known ever now,” Jawsh said, incredulously. And “Savage Love” has become perhaps the biggest global hit to emerge from a Pasifika act since OMC’s wry 1995 lounge-rock smash “How Bizarre.”


  Jawsh’s music is “an authentic snapshot of youth music culture out here,” said Faiumu Matthew Salapu, an Auckland music producer who records as Anonymouz. “Back in the ’90s the dominant frequency was subs, subwoofers in cars. It’s just fascinating that in this day and age that frequency has shifted over to treble. It’s all about like the most piercing frequencies. And it’s massive. You can’t really go anywhere in South Auckland without people just jamming these sounds.”


  On YouTube, you can find clips of young people wiring up sirens to their cars and bicycles as a meta-speaker system.

Maggie Walker, one of the first Black American women to run a bank, is buried at Evergreen Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia. So is John Mitchell Jr., editor of The Richmond Planet, a crusading newspaper founded by former slaves. Benjamin Franklin Randolph, a South Carolina state senator gunned down amid the white backlash against Reconstruction in 1868, lies in the Black cemetery named for him in Columbia.


  In the late 19th century, as statues, monuments and government buildings were being dedicated to Robert E. Lee and other leaders of the Confederacy, a powerful and countervailing force of memory was unfolding, in many cases right across town: Black communities were building cemeteries to honor a first wave of soldiers, politicians and business leaders after the end of slavery.

THE North Mackay Saints have retained the AFL Mackay A-Grade premiership with a comprehensive 47-point win over the Eastern Swans at Harrup Park tonight.
 The Saints led at every change to run out 9.13-67 to 3.2-20 victors under lights.
 Joel Campbell and Cody Filewood kicked two goals each, but for the minor premiers there was no true standout on a night of pure elation for the red, white and black.
 MJ Miller medal runner-up Luke Slater reprised his incredible form over the regular season to be named best on ground in the decider.
 For the Saints, who will now extend their unbeaten run into a third calendar year, it was a fitting way to send out retiring club great James Gallagher.
 The four-time premiership-winning midfielder declared he would hang up the boots after winning a flag in his 200th senior game for the club.
 After the drought-breaking success of last season, coach Craig Jenkins said winning the 2020 flag was “a bit of a load off”.
 “I think the pressure was there internally (to go back-to-back). But after last year, I think we handled it a lot better this time. We knew what we were in for and the boys were on top of it,” he said.

He’d been posting his songs to YouTube, but, unknown to him, someone else had edited “Laxed” down to a catchy snippet, and TikTok lit the match. Not long after, Jason Derulo recorded a version with lyrics, and after some behind-the- scenes back and forth, an official version of that song, now titled “Savage Love (Laxed — Siren Beat),” went on to become a global smash, topping charts in New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Britain and more. Currently, it sits at No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100.


  “Laxed” is both modern and traditional — the pacing and melody are indebted to Polynesian music, and also classic reggae. (Laxed is short for relaxed.) But its texture is specifically of the moment — each note sounds as if it had been sucked through a glitchy vortex and spit back out.


  Which in a way, they had been. “Laxed” was also an arrival on the world stage for siren jams — an emergent scene filled with producers specializing in music suited for blasting through sirens attached to the front of cars and bicycles. It’s a recent youth culture phenomenon in Pacific Islander, or Pasifika, communities in New Zealand and surrounding areas.


  “My siren jam is somehow the most known ever now,” Jawsh said, incredulously. And “Savage Love” has become perhaps the biggest global hit to emerge from a Pasifika act since OMC’s wry 1995 lounge-rock smash “How Bizarre.”


  Jawsh’s music is “an authentic snapshot of youth music culture out here,” said Faiumu Matthew Salapu, an Auckland music producer who records as Anonymouz. “Back in the ’90s the dominant frequency was subs, subwoofers in cars. It’s just fascinating that in this day and age that frequency has shifted over to treble. It’s all about like the most piercing frequencies. And it’s massive. You can’t really go anywhere in South Auckland without people just jamming these sounds.”


  On YouTube, you can find clips of young people wiring up sirens to their cars and bicycles as a meta-speaker system. It’s the sort of phenomenon that triggered the usual skepticism from older generations and at least a handful of moral-panic local news reports lamenting that young people were stealing sirens from schools for the purpose.


  But while Salapu noted that siren culture is “anti-establishment, rebellious,” he also pointed out that much of the music emerging from that scene has strong connections to the sounds of earlier generations. “That frequency range and that style of melody is prevalent in a lot of Pacific music out here,” he said. “We hear these progressions in our church music.”


  Graham Reid, a former journalist who teaches New Zealand pop music history at the University of Auckland, noted the connections between Jawsh’s music and reggae, adding that “the reggae beat is just a shift from what we call the ‘Maori strum,’” pointing out the way “Laxed” sits “just behind the beat — that’s a kick back, Pasifika thing.”


  Jawsh 685 — born Joshua Nanai — is the third oldest of four children born to a father from Samoa and a mother from the Cook Islands, who met in New Zealand. (685 is the country code for Samoa, though Jawsh has never been there.) Manurewa, in South Auckland, has been a magnet for Pasifika communities for decades. “A lot of people like to talk down on where I’m from,” Jawsh said. “It’s not as bad as what people say.”


  His parents listened to “old island music,” Elvis Presley, and also Britney Spears and Mariah Carey. But he listened primarily to siren jams on YouTube, where a few channels specialize in posting the latest ones, all produced and released independently.


  When he decided he wanted to make them himself, he reached out to the one producer he was acquainted with, who wouldn’t give up all the secrets. So Jawsh set out to teach himself. As with many production styles, there are sample packs passed around that contain loads of foundational sounds to build songs around.


  Working on a broken laptop and using the ubiquitous production program FL Studio, Jawsh said he made the original “Laxed” beat in around four hours. Unlike many traditional pop or hip-hop producers who might primarily focus on the beat and leave the songwriting to others, Jawsh included melodic top lines in his production.

Already before the latest evictions, about 2,500 people - roughly one third of those currently stuck in Bosnia - were forced to sleep rough in the woods or in abandoned buildings. In a forest close to Velika Kladuša, 300 people who had been expelled from the city have built tents using plastic tarps and sticks, to establish a makeshift camp. “What is the sad part of this is that this is absolutely unnecessary in the sense that we have financial resources, provided mostly by the European Union, to provide (for) and take care of all those people,” commented IOM-official Peter Van der Auweraert the situation. So far, Bosnia has received 60 million euros in emergency funding, mainly for running the seven reception centres which are equipped to accommodate more than 7,000 people in total.

The syringes used to inject inoculations are also running low. The United States needs an estimated 850 million more syringes to distribute both coronavirus and seasonal influenza vaccines. As of May, it only had 15 million stockpiled. Though the Department of Health and Human Services has contracted with several companies to manufacture 820 million more syringes, only 420 million will be available by the end of the year.
 There are also shortcomings within the "cold chain" for vaccines. Vaccines have to be kept at a constant, cool temperature, typically between 35 and 46 degrees Fahrenheit, even when transported across the country. Outside of this range, they lose their potency and must be thrown away. It only takes one trucking leg that isn't temperature-controlled to spoil an entire batch.
 If there's any hope in preventing vaccine shortages, these issues must be addressed.
 The U.S. government has entered into contracts with multiple companies, allowing them to expand their manufacturing capacities and make more vials. Fostering more of these partnerships between government and private enterprises would help alleviate roadblocks in the vaccine supply chain.
 The government could also rethink how it allocates vaccines. Flu vaccines are distributed based on cities' and states' populations. But this approach doesn't reflect the share of the population that is willing to actually get the vaccine. When the uptake rate in a population is low, unused vaccines accumulate. Officials should take uptake rates into account to prevent surpluses in some regions and shortages in others.
 These changes won't help without a more streamlined cold chain transportation process. Simple changes -- like limiting handoff points, consolidating shipments, and monitoring the temperature of shipments in real-time -- can mitigate damages to scarce vaccine supplies.
 Developing a COVID-19 vaccine is merely the beginning of the end of this pandemic. To wipe out the virus, lawmakers need to address shortfalls in the supply chain.

 They added: “Will was a much-loved dad, son, brother, uncle, partner and friend. He was loving and caring and always thought of others before himself. He was the light of our lives, his death has left a huge void in our lives.

Elijah Pierce’s America’ Review: Working Against the Grain - WSJ

“They’re up for grabs,” says Laurie Watkins, the House Democrats' top strategist, who has Broward ties. “Voters want choices.”


  Can Democrats do better? If they can’t gain ground this year, it’s probably impossible. There’s the leveling effects of a pandemic, a Republican governor whose popularity has nosedived, an expected huge voter turnout and a self- destructive and increasingly dangerous Donald J. Trump as a potential huge drag on the Republican ticket.


  “I do not think this is a good year for Republicans,” says Rep. Joe Geller, D-Aventura.


  Legislative races are often decided by purely local factors such as a winning candidate’s messaging or the “ground game” of targeting voters. But this year, turnout on both sides will be driven largely by Trump, and in the back of their minds, Republicans realize a collapse of epic proportions is possible.


  Under this scenario, many dispirited Republicans lose hope and don’t bother to vote and GOP candidates are buried under an avalanche of Democratic ballots. Under this far-fetched scenario, Democrats incredibly net 14 seats and reclaim the House after 24 years in a lonely and dispiriting exile. Democrats claim they won’t even consider that possibility, Rep. Evan Jenne, D-Dania Beach, told me.


  Hardly anybody in today’s Tallahassee can recall the days of the “Broward Mafia,” when Democrats ran the House (at times with even more arrogance than today’s Republicans) and Broward controlled most of the levers of power. After years of slow, steady Democratic losses, it finally came crashing down on Nov. 5, 1996, when Republicans pulled off a couple of upsets and achieved a majority.


  Today, Republicans hold 72 House seats and Democrats 46 with two seats vacant in Broward and Tampa. Democrats hope to pick up enough seats to get to the low to mid-50′s, which would create a sense of momentum entering the next reapportionment cycle in 2022. But it can’t happen unless they “flip” Republican seats.


  They could start by winning the so-called “Gillum 7,” seven seats where Gillum beat Ron DeSantis in the race for governor, but the Democratic House candidate lost (four of them are the ones cited above). Other battlegrounds are in Hillsborough, Orange and Seminole counties, areas trending blue, and a definite “flip” target is coastal Broward’s District 93, where Republican Chip LaMarca tries to fend off a challenge from Linda Thompson Gonzalez.

They’ve been by your side from the proposal through the big day, and now it’s your turn to say thank you with a thoughtful bridesmaid gift.      While some brides choose to present their bridesmaids with something special when they ask them to join their party (though it’s not necessary, according to the author of Modern Etiquette for a Better Life and founder of The Protocol School of Texas, Diane Gottsman), a token of your appreciation closer to your wedding date is something every bride should plan for. “They have gone through the journey with you and given you a shower, and put in a lot of time and effort in making all of your plans come to fruition. You would give them something nice and something substantial,” Diane tells Real Simple.      And while there’s no set price point you should abide by, Diane recommends gifting something that feels personal in the $45–$75 range, or more if your budget allows. “They’re showing you effort, so you want to follow suit,” she says. “There is no set fee, however it has to be something that they like. And you should make it personal with a handwritten note for each of them.”      Ahead, you’ll find bridesmaid gift ideas that you simply can’t go wrong with. Happy gifting!

Anyone who has put off signing up to vote in the Nov. 3 elections has until close of business on Monday to get registered.
 Early voting will run from Monday, Oct. 12, until Friday, Oct. 30. Gordon County will host Saturday voting during that time on Oct. 24 from 9 a.m. until 4 p.m.
 Absentee ballots may be dropped off in a slot to the left of the doors at the Gordon County Board of Elections and Voter Registration Office, located in the Gordon County Annex Building on South Piedmont Street in Downtown Calhoun.
 So far, more than 1.2 million Georgians have requested absentee ballots for the Nov. 3 election, according to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.
 State election officials expect to see record turnout for the coronavirus- troubled election.
 Many of those asking for absentee ballots were voters who voted by mail for the primaries in June and opted to automatically receive an absentee ballot for November. Others have used the state’s new online portal to request a mail-in ballot.
 The drop-box option has been pitched as a way to motivate more Georgians to vote early in the general election rather than flood polling places on Election Day. Officials expect long lines even with a large vote-by-mail and early voting campaign.
 The drop boxes are anchored to the ground, monitored by constant surveillance video and can only be opened by a team of two poll workers. They will be emptied at least once every 72 hours until Oct. 26, after which they will be emptied every 24 hours.
 Beyond the drop boxes, county election officials will be able to scan absentee ballots starting two weeks before Election Day to help tabulate huge numbers of ballots more easily.
 Additionally, Raffensperger’s office has launched a new online tracking system called BallotTrax that lets voters sign up for text or email alerts on their ballot status.
 “Creating this new absentee ballot tracking and notification system will provide Georgia voters with greater clarity and increased confidence that their votes are accepted,” Raffensperger said in a statement.
 With the tracking system, voters will receive a message when their absentee- ballot application is accepted, when the ballot itself is sent to a voter and whether the cast ballot is accepted or rejected, according to Raffensperger’s office.
 Anyone whose mail-in ballot is rejected will be given instructions on how to correct the issue and make sure their vote is counted, Raffensperger’s office said.
 Georgia is poised for record voter turnout in the Nov. 3 general election with a presidential contest, two U.S. Senate seats, congressional, state and local offices all on the ballot.

Half Moon Bay officials are putting the finishing touches on an update of an expansive planning document that will guide growth in town over the next 20 years.
 The updated local coastal land use plan, what’s referred to as the LUP, comprises the city’s policy approach for carrying out the Coastal Act and guiding review of coastal development projects through 2040.
 The LUP includes updated requirements to protect wetlands, riparian corridors and other sensitive habitat areas; protect and maximize public access to and along the shoreline; concentrate new development in existing developed areas; and provide for certain priority land uses such as recreational facilities, visitor-serving uses and affordable housing, according to a staff report.
 During a meeting Wednesday, councilmembers noted the updated LUP has been in the works for seven years and said they’re poised to adopt it at a meeting sometime in October.
 “I think we’re there except for some tweaks,” said Councilwoman Debbie Ruddock during the meeting. “[The plan] lays the foundation for everything built on top so it’s very very critically important.”
 According to the staff report, facilitating “a diverse range of housing that is more sustainable, affordable and appropriate for the needs of the local community is a cornerstone of the LUP update.”
 To achieve that, the LUP increases the development capacity in the town center, includes a workforce housing overlay that creates affordable housing sites for agriculture, expands affordable mobile home park areas and encourages multi-family development in planned development land use designations.
 Ruddock said the plan includes a “very strong vision and the town center is the focus of that.”
 “If we want to protect our open spaces, if we want a more sustainable community, if we want to deal with wildfires and climate change and food supply then you have to concentrate development where it’s least impactful,” she said.
 “[In the town center concept in the plan] we can serve diverse incomes, we can serve diverse commercial pursuits. It can all happen there and be close to transit and generate transit because of the footprint. And it gives us a chance to protect the open spaces we have,” Ruddock said.
 Many residents during the public comment portion of the meeting expressed deep concerns about overdevelopment, traffic congestion and erosion in and around town. They feel the LUP fails to address those concerns.
 “The concern is in the end of the process it’s going to end up we’re overdeveloping the coastside and the quality of life is going to suffer and we’ll be further burdened by traffic and basically the area is going to be ruined because we’re in a rush to develop,” said resident Brent Turner.
 Many other residents echoed the sentiment and some blamed the council for the above problems. Councilmembers took issue with those accusations.
 “Comments saying this council is only interested in development and maximizing income — I think that’s about as far from the truth as I could possibly imagine,” said Councilman Harvey Rarback. “We’re all interested in what’s in the first chapter of the LUP and that is preserving the small town character, the coastal nature, open space — that’s on all of our minds.”
 The LUP includes a “maximum theoretical buildout potential” of 7,051 dwelling units by 2040, which is actually about 1,300 units fewer than the LUP adopted 20 years ago.
 “So as people keep talking about the exponential growth in Half Moon Bay you’re actually saying this new plan is doing less for growth,” Mayor Adam Eisen asked one of the city’s planners. The answer was “yes.”
 The plan also notes buildout projections “are theoretical as they represent an extreme scenario of development that is unlikely to ever occur.”
 Residents of the Casa Mira neighborhood also raised concerns about restrictions in the LUP that fail to protect homes and a segment of the coastal trail from erosion.
 “[These residents] are concerned that because the LUP update does not allow riprap or seawall to be placed to protect a collapsing bluff in front of their homes that they will lose their homes,” said Tom Roth, an attorney representing the Casa Mira Homeowners Association. “Second they’re concerned about the loss of one of the most scenic stretches of the coastal trail in the entire state of California — that’s going to collapse when that bluff collapses.”
 He said the trail that would replace, as outlined in the updated LUP, “is simply not a coastal trail and doesn’t have views of the ocean.”
 City Attorney Catherine Engberg said the updated LUP sought to provide those residents options as well as balance their interests with the protection of coastal resources.
 “We believe the policies before you are designed to strike a balance between private property planning and at the same time protecting coastal resources,” she said. “Overall the changes staff has proposed here are intended to provide flexibility to the residents of Casa Mira and citywide.”
 But Rod Young, a Casa Mira resident, said the LUP leaves him few options to protect his home and all are less than ideal.
 “The proposed plan appears to allow us only three alternatives for protecting our homes,” Young said. “[Those options are] reinforce the homes, which doesn’t solve a problem with erosion of the bluff; relocate the homes, which is likely not possible; or remove the homes. ... We’ll either have to absorb the very considerable financial loss or file suit against the city of Half Moon Bay for illegal taking under the California/U.S. constitutions.”

The Delhi High Court has sought a response from the police on the bail plea of former Fortis Healthcare promoter Shivinder Mohan Singh in a case related to alleged misappropriation of funds at Religare Finvest Ltd (RFL).
 Justice Suresh Kumar Kait issued the notice on Shivinder Mohan Singh's plea and sought a response from the Delhi Police and RFL, the complainant in the case.
 "The Additional Public Prosecutor accepts notice and seeks time to file a status report. Let needful be done within one week with an advance copy to the other side," the court said and listed the matter for further hearing on October 12. Singh has challenged a trial court's September 25 order dismissing his bail plea.
 Senior advocate Mohit Mathur, appearing for complainant RFL, said he will file a reply to the contention raised in the petition by Singh. He had opposed the bail plea in the trial court saying RFL did not get back its money and suffered losses because of the acts and omissions of Singh and others.
 The trial court had observed economic offences having deep-rooted conspiracies needed to be considered as grave offences affecting the economy of the country.
 It had said the possibility of the witnesses being influenced by Shivinder cannot be ruled out as during investigation statements of directors of the companies to which loans were extended by RFL were recorded and they were found to be associated with him.
 The trial court had also said it was prima facie established from the investigation that Singh in conspiracy with others caused wrongful gain to RFL to the tune of Rs 2,397 crore.
 Shivinder Mohan Singh's brother Malvinder Singh(46), also a former Fortis Healthcare promoter, former CMD of Religare Enterprises Ltd (REL) Sunil Godhwani (58), Kavi Arora (48) and Anil Saxena were arrested by the Economic Offences Wing of Delhi Police last year, for allegedly diverting RFL's money and investing in other companies.
 His counsel had submitted that the entire evidence was documentary in nature and has been seized and thus there was no possibility of evidence being tampered with by him.
 The police had opposed the bail plea saying huge financial fraud has been committed in the case and hence, Shivinder Mohan Singh was not entitled to bail. RFL's counsel had alleged it was the public money which was swindled by Shivinder Mohan Singh.
 The EOW registered an FIR in March last year after it received a complaint from RFL's Manpreet Suri against Shivinder, Godhwani and others, alleging that loans were taken by them while managing the firm but the money was invested in other companies. The Enforcement Directorate lodged a money laundering case based on this.
 RFL is a group firm of REL, which was earlier promoted by Malvinder and his brother Shivinder.

He’d been posting his songs to YouTube, but, unknown to him, someone else had edited “Laxed” down to a catchy snippet, and TikTok lit the match. Not long after, Jason Derulo recorded a version with lyrics, and after some behind-the- scenes back and forth, an official version of that song, now titled “Savage Love (Laxed — Siren Beat),” went on to become a global smash, topping charts in New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Britain and more. Currently, it sits at No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100.
 “Laxed” is both modern and traditional — the pacing and melody are indebted to Polynesian music, and also classic reggae. (Laxed is short for relaxed.) But its texture is specifically of the moment — each note sounds as if it had been sucked through a glitchy vortex and spit back out.
 Which in a way, they had been. “Laxed” was also an arrival on the world stage for siren jams — an emergent scene filled with producers specializing in music suited for blasting through sirens attached to the front of cars and bicycles. It’s a recent youth culture phenomenon in Pacific Islander, or Pasifika, communities in New Zealand and surrounding areas.
 “My siren jam is somehow the most known ever now,” Jawsh said, incredulously. And “Savage Love” has become perhaps the biggest global hit to emerge from a Pasifika act since OMC’s wry 1995 lounge-rock smash “How Bizarre.”
 Jawsh’s music is “an authentic snapshot of youth music culture out here,” said Faiumu Matthew Salapu, an Auckland music producer who records as Anonymouz. “Back in the ’90s the dominant frequency was subs, subwoofers in cars. It’s just fascinating that in this day and age that frequency has shifted over to treble. It’s all about like the most piercing frequencies. And it’s massive. You can’t really go anywhere in South Auckland without people just jamming these sounds.”
 On YouTube, you can find clips of young people wiring up sirens to their cars and bicycles as a meta-speaker system. It’s the sort of phenomenon that triggered the usual skepticism from older generations and at least a handful of moral-panic local news reports lamenting that young people were stealing sirens from schools for the purpose.
 But while Salapu noted that siren culture is “anti-establishment, rebellious,” he also pointed out that much of the music emerging from that scene has strong connections to the sounds of earlier generations. “That frequency range and that style of melody is prevalent in a lot of Pacific music out here,” he said. “We hear these progressions in our church music.”
 Graham Reid, a former journalist who teaches New Zealand pop music history at the University of Auckland, noted the connections between Jawsh’s music and reggae, adding that “the reggae beat is just a shift from what we call the ‘Maori strum,’” pointing out the way “Laxed” sits “just behind the beat — that’s a kick back, Pasifika thing.”

Officer Brett Hankison told investigators looking into police actions during the March 13 raid that his fellow officers were positioned “like sitting ducks.” Hankinson said he began shooting, and the lights from gunfire inside the apartment continued, so he opened fire again through a window. He said as soon as he "returned fire through the window, the threat stopped, the gunfire stopped.” Hankison's interview with police investigators was played for a grand jury.

You don't need to spring for a grill with loads of extra bells and whistles, but you do want to make sure you're getting one that won't fizzle out in two years (because constantly replacing sub-par grills is definitely not the best use of your barbecue budget). Browne recommends buying just enough grill for what your family uses--possibly going for a bigger grill surface if you entertain a lot. And you'll want enough space on your grill surface to multi- task (think chicken on one side and corn on the other).      You'll also always want to be on the hunt for sturdy construction, because you don't want the grill to tip over or crash. Both Brown and Raichlen are fans of the classic Weber kettle grill as a dependable, basic option that will get just about every grilling or smoking job done. But Raichlen suggests going to weekend demos at local grill and barbecue shops to get a feel for what exact type of grill will work best for you.

_Napoli, 02 ott 13:03 - (Agenzia Nova)_ \- Il nucleo di Polizia turistica ha effettuato un'attività di controllo nell'ambito del settore del trasporto scolastico a Napoli, mirata non solo alla verifica del rispetto delle norme che lo disciplinano da parte degli operatori, ma anche all'accertamento della esatta osservanza delle specifiche misure di contenimento della diffusione del Covid-19, linee guida fissate dal Dpcm del 7 settembre. I controlli sono stati effettuati nelle strade adiacenti piazza Carlo III, dove sono presenti numerosi plessi scolastici. Un operatore autorizzato è stato multato per 530 euro perché trasportava uno studente sul sedile anteriore, in violazione delle norme di contenimento del contagio da Covid-19. Alla guida di un veicolo regolarmente adibito a trasporto scolastico è stato sorpreso un conducente diverso dal titolare dell'autorizzazione. Il trasgressore è stato multato per 173 euro e il veicolo è stato sottoposto a fermo amministrativo per due mesi. È stato inoltre intercettato un conducente abusivo che utilizzava per il servizio un veicolo immatricolato per uso proprio, che era stato anche modificato con l'aggiunta di sedili per aumentare il numero di posti senza aggiornamento della carta di circolazione. Al trasgressore sono state contestate la violazioni degli articoli 85 e 78 del codice della strada per un totale di 600 euro, mentre il veicolo è stato sottoposto a fermo amministrativo per due mesi ed all'obbligo di ripristino del numero di posti indicato dalla carta di circolazione certificato con l'invio del mezzo ad una revisione speciale.

Perfect for snacking on their own, a simple pear becomes rather sophisticated when sliced and roasted, the edges becoming slightly caramelized. Place slices on a pretty plate and serve with cinnamon ice cream or fresh ricotta cheese mixed with a bit of maple syrup. A smattering of sliced almonds and you have a most elegant ending to an autumn meal. For a savory option, place those same roasted pear slices on a bed of baby kale, arugula or frisee, drizzle with fig balsamic vinegar and shower with shards of gorgonzola or parmesan cheese.
