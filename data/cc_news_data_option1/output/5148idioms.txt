One-and-a-half-meter-society has been voted the Dutch word of the year by a (social) distance.
 Anderhalvemetersamenleving, a compound noun describing life under the Dutch government’s 1.5-meter (5-foot) social distancing requirement, was the runaway winner of a vote held by the Van Dale dictionary company.
 The lengthy new word, which was added to the dictionary in April during the first spike in Dutch coronavirus infections, garnered just under 30% of some 12,000 votes in the annual competition.
 The results were announced Tuesday, the day the Netherlands began a strict five-week lockdown to counter recent sharp rises in new infections.

Defender TNZ appears to be the early pacesetter, dominating practice sessions, following by Luna Rossa, American Magic and Team U.K. Bookmakers have the New Zealanders as short-priced favorites for the overall event, predicting they will retain the trophy in March. But Luna Rossa skipper Max Sirena warned there was a long way to go, saying his crew would match Team NZ for "street- fighter" attitude. "It's too early for anyone to come up with a conclusion. For sure you have an idea, but I think it's too early, anything can happen," he told New Zealand media. Luna Rossa will have Australia's Jimmy Spithill at the helm, who humbled the New Zealanders when he masterminded a dramatic come- from-behind victory to claim the Auld Mug for Oracle Team USA in San Francisco in 2013. The three challengers will compete in the Prada Cup from Jan. 15 to Feb. 22 for the right to race Team NZ for the Cup in March.
