Launching, growing and maintaining a successful business is an almost impossible task at the best of times. If it were easy everyone would do it. The truth is that behind every triumph is 1pc great idea and 99pc blood, sweat and tears. And the last few years have been anything but normal. The business community has been on tenterhooks since 2016. It matters not which way anyone voted in the hugely divisive Brexit referendum now but the uncertainty that it has caused business rumbles on. And yet this region's business community continues to prosper. In January came more unwelcome news as a then little understood outbreak of some strange illness in China began to spread. No one could have predicted the wave of chaos and destructive that engulfed each and every one of us in the intervening months. Yes, there are reasons to be hopeful, there is a faint light at the end of a still very considerable tunnel. But 2020 was as much about survival as growth. And yet, again, this region's business community hunkered down and got to work - even if more often than not it was on a Zoom call from the living room with the cat obscuring the camera. Never before in peacetime has Suffolk's businesses faced such a challenge. I was flabbergasted by the quality of entries to the Suffolk Business Awards this year. In what has been a unremittingly bleak year these awards proved a very bright point. Your stories, your endeavours your sheer hard graft is truly inspiring. So, congratulations - you are the very best of the very best. The winners will be revealed from 8am-1pm tomorrow, so keep your eyes on our social media channels - follow #SBA2020 for all the news and reaction - and the East Anglian Daily Times website on the big day. In this strangest of years we are more grateful then ever to all our category sponsors and the headline sponsors Suffolk Chamber of Commerce and Sizewell C. Without their support we would not have been able to honour so many incredible achievements. In January we will be releasing a series of videos featuring all of our winners. So please do keep an eye out for that across our social media channels and on our website. Things will improve. Life and business will get back to normal. And we will all be even stronger for this struggle. Congratulations to all our nominees and winners.

So patients who have previously tried a migraine treatment, but they failed, or they weren't tolerant of that medication. And that's upwards of 30% to 40% of migraines in Canada that fit into that categories. That's a big part of the market. And so, we've got Phase III clinical data showing that Suvexx is efficacious and safe in those patients. And you don't have many other treatments that have that strong data. And that's the kind of clinical data that's resonating with the physicians that we're speaking with. And it's giving them another treatment option for their patients. So -- and then I guess the other thing to add to this is when you look at why would a polypill or fixed dose combination be perhaps more successful in the migraine space versus the cardiovascular arena, which is where you would have historically seen a lot of fixed dose combinations. And it's really probably comes down to the treatment guidelines, where a combination of a triptan and an NSAID is written in black and white in the treatment guidelines as a second-line treatment option for patients that are inadequately treated on a monotherapy regimen.

Yes. Thanks very much, Jo-Anne. So before we wrap up our presentation today, I wanted to just briefly take stock and highlight that as our work advances and our underground production eventually ramps up, Oyu Tolgoi's progression from a Tier 1 resource to a Tier 1 operating asset becomes more and more evident for everyone to see. Oyu Tolgoi is forecast to be the world's fourth largest copper producer when fully ramped up, trailing only Escondida, Grasberg and Collahuasi. And as Oyu Tolgoi continues to capitalize on its scale, significant resource base and higher grade underground ore, we expect C1 cash costs to decrease to first quartile levels. Quality of this asset, in combination with our continued focus on operational excellence and an exceptional Mongolian workforce, are expected to establish a competitive and profitable producer that is well-positioned to perform even during the lowest points in a commodity cycle.

For these lawmakers to point the finger at Facebook and Google for their party's dismal performance is sheer madness and hypocrisy. Have they forgotten both of these companies (along with the rest of the legacy media) suppressed the bombshell news that former Vice President Joe Biden was allegedly involved and slated to benefit financially from his son's potentially lucrative influence-peddling deal with a Chinese company? That was a huge story which, if widely reported, would have damaged Biden's candidacy. And, if the allegations are true, it would make Biden a national security risk.

Apart from saving the capital spending of enterprises, data center colocation offers several benefits that lure the customers. Uptime reliability is one of the most prominent benefits of adopting colocation services. The colocation centers are built with high specifications for redundancy, and thus they are often up and running as compared to private data centers. Additionally, adoption of colocation data centers translates to lower costs, fewer technical staff, easy scalability, and predictable monthly or yearly expenses. Owing to the above-mentioned benefits, the market is anticipated to witness steady growth in the next few years.

Back To Square One: Hank Paulson Calls For New Round Of US-China Talks "Under Biden Administration"

"One worries that a person like Trump, who's pissed off at the world and sitting there sucking his thumb and feeling sorry for himself, will wake up at three in the morning and tweet something that could be really destabilizing," Bob Deitz, the former general counsel at the National Security Agency, told Insider. "There's also the concern that he might just -- and he's been trying to do this -- declassify information about Russia because of his vendetta over the Mueller investigation."
 Since Trump lost the election, the following officials were fired, stepped down, or resigned in protest: the secretary of defense, the undersecretary of defense for intelligence, the defense secretary's chief of staff, the deputy chief of staff, the National Security Agency's general counsel, the Department of Homeland Security's assistant director for cybersecurity, the Department of Energy's head of National Nuclear Security Administration, the DHS's assistant undersecretary for international affairs, and the head of the Justice Department's Election Crimes division.
 More shoes may drop soon. Trump has been furious for months with FBI Director Christopher Wray and Attorney General William Barr over their refusal to open investigations targeting the Bidens to give Trump a pre-election boost in the polls. The president is also said to be frustrated with CIA Director Gina Haspel after she and other officials strongly opposed his push to broadly declassify intelligence about Russia that could compromise sources and methods.
 And in the last several days, Chris Krebs, the head of the DHS's Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Agency who played a robust role in countering Trump's conspiracy theories about voter and election fraud, told associates he expected to be fired by the White House.

And then the market could easily be in the millions of tests per year, and I think we charge a very similar amount to what we do in the vet space, and a very similar margin. So the addressable market is certainly in the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars a year. What we get of it will depend of course obviously on the results from trial, and the rollout and everything else, but it's by no means a micro market, and it's in a very good space for the company because you don't have to do a large PMA study, like in colorectal, but it's still a very, very large addressable market. So I think if we can show good data it could be an excellent product, and really put us on the map in the U.S., and timing wise, obviously, the first readout we hope to be the end of next year. So, it could well be a 2022 story when we have an FDA approved product that we could expect to be a very large addressable market. So, time will tell, but we're very encouraged with what we've seen so far.

Thanks Scott. I guess in terms of the first couple quarters of revenue as a company in Australia, we’ve obviously only been able to focus in terms of actual transactions to deliver product out to the end of the quarter to companies actually in Australia, and that’s obviously because the aspect of actually having our license here in Australia gives us the opportunity to get the product registered in other countries, like New Zealand, Germany and Europe. That regulatory pathway, even with the GMP license, does take some time, and the good news is we’ve been working on that actually behind the scenes for many months now, so we’re late stage and now evolution of getting approved from the Ministry of Healthy in New Zealand [indiscernible] stage of getting our products approved to be registered with MediPharm in Germany, so we’re looking at the early quarters of next year will be very productive in terms of transacting actual product delivery from Australian facilities to those international markets.

"We have now agreed to send unredacted documents to the Law Clerk, except those that were redacted to protect cabinet confidences and unrelated material as already allowed by the committee motion," Rodriguez said Monday in a Twitter post.
 That proposal differs somewhat from the Conservative motion, which would leave it in the law clerk's hands to black out confidential cabinet communications and irrelevant content.
 Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre says his party is willing to meet the Liberals halfway.
 "If the government insists that it needs to put aside what it claims are cabinet confidences, fine, we’ll do that for now," he said Monday at a news conference.
 The issue of unrelated documents arriving in the law clerk's hands already redacted remains a "sticking point," he added, leaving it up in the air whether the Tories will accept Rodriguez's compromise.

Fauci dialed in with some motivational words
 The episode was released hours after pharmaceutical company Moderna announced that a preliminary analysis showed its experimental coronavirus vaccine was 94.5% effective at preventing COVID-19.
 Last Monday, Pfizer announced its vaccine was found to be more than 90% effective at preventing COVID-19. While neither vaccine has received FDA approval and many questions remain, the two developments are highly encouraging in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.
 While recorded before Moderna's announcement, Jones, Gates, and Fauci discuss what a vaccine rollout could look like, as well as how they envision post- COVID life. They also reiterate that mask-wearing, social distancing, and hand hygiene remain critical in getting the virus under control.
 Until it's eliminated from not just the country, but the world, life can't completely go back to normal, Gates and Fauci agreed. Still, Fauci urged listeners to stay the course, which may be easier now that two promising vaccines suggest an end is in sight.

The Northfield City Council authorized $194,000 in federal COVID-19 relief dollars, with more than a third of it going to the city's hospital for a virtual platform providing self-guided exams
 The $75,000 in Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act funding for Northfield Hospital and Clinics will purchase the platform to provide patients access to self-guided medical exams. Such visits take minutes, allow providers to quickly triage, asses and treat patients, who will be charged $35 to $55 per meet. If an in-person visit is recommended, patients won't face additional costs.
 The council on Nov. 10 also allocated:
 • $50,100 to the Northfield Area Chamber of Commerce and Tourism for staff time to assist and communicate to the local business community during the pandemic on COVID-19 regulations and executive orders, in partnership with the city’s emergency management and economic development partners.
 Councilor Jessica Peterson White noted businesses pay a Chamber membership cost and asked whether the funding could be used for all Northfield businesses. City Administrator Ben Martig noted the Chamber has made resources available for businesses, corresponded with the business community via email and marketed the entire community.
 • $43,532 for Northfield Public Schools for personal protective equipment, cleaning supplies and communication equipment to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Northfield Schools announced Nov. 10 that the school would enter distance learning exclusively within the next two week.
 • $25,000 to the Convention & Visitors Bureau for community marketing work relating to visiting the city during the pandemic.
 Martig noted the council’s vision for the funding to stabilize the local economy and households have a long-term impac, and provide social support.
 “It’s a good way to get the money at least accounted for so if we don’t have all the money out the door we can still transfer it later,” said Councilor Brad Ness of the allocations. “It makes a whole lot of sense.”
 The allocations are part of the $1.53 million the city received in CARES funding following the onset of the pandemic. Early last month, the council agreed to spend nearly $780,000 of the city’s allocation, with $120,000 of that to make police officers’ work stations meet public health standards.
 The city has already allocated $500,000 in federal funding for local businesses and nonprofits. In early September, the council allocated $300,000 in business grants. Of that, up to $10,000 is possible for each project, and $50,000 was reserved for minority owned businesses. The council also approved $200,000 for nonprofit grants, with up to $10,000 for each project and $25,000 reserved for organizations that specifically serve minority and low-income residents. The council in August allocated $145,000 in federal funding to the Community Action Center to support approximately 3,750 families. In addition, councilors in August provided $75,000 to the city for work relating to downtown outdoor furnishings and equipment for added physical distancing during the pandemic.
 An additional city allocation is expected Nov. 17, and a second round of grants to businesses and nonprofits is possible.

Former President Barack Obama said social media companies should be regulated in some capacity as tech firms continue to argue that they shouldn't be treated as publishers.
 In an interview with The Atlantic, the former president said tech companies are still "making editorial choices" despite insisting they do not operate as newspapers and other news outlets do, whether those editorial decisions are made with algorithms or otherwise.
 "The First Amendment doesn't require private companies to provide a platform for any view that is out there," Obama told The Atlantic. "At the end of the day, we're going to have to find a combination of government regulations and corporate practices that address this, because it's going to get worse."
 He also alluded to the danger of deepfake videos, which use artificial intelligence to change someone's face in a video to another's, effectively showing something that didn't happen. The former President himself has appeared in one such video in 2018 when he appeared to call President Donald Trump a "dips---."

To be sure, these commitments will need to be backed by concrete policies. But even words carry power. Neither Chinese President Xi Jinping nor European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is known for hyperbole or making major declarations without prior deliberation. If they set a concrete target, that means they have some sense of how to reach it.
 Moreover, it is not as though it will be easy for the EU’s 27 member states to agree on a more ambitious 2030 target that is in line with its commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. European leaders are well aware of the many vested interests standing ready to oppose the new goal. Nor is it easy for China’s leadership to announce that it will hit peak emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. Reorienting an economy as large as China’s is no small task. Yet both powers recognize that the reality of climate change makes an economic transition inevitable, and that whoever moves first will have a major competitive advantage for decades to come.
 Overhauling an economy at the speed needed to reduce national emissions in line with the 2015 Paris climate agreement has never been done, and will require strong distributed leadership of a kind that is already coming into view. Countries, regions, cities, and major business and financial actors have all started to set net-zero targets of their own. Five years after the Paris accord was signed, these commitments indicate that a critical mass is building. Chinese and European leaders recognize that this is the moment to press ahead with concrete, detailed plans of action.
 There is no “one size fits all” plan. Some plans are about technology changes, but many other transitions will require the ownership of citizens, a stronger emphasis on restoring nature, or a systemic approach. We can all learn from each other’s experiences along the way.
 For its part, China will need to map out a long-term strategy with specific milestones for reaching its 2060 goal. Having such a plan in place is necessary to ensure that short-term decision-making – from the next five-year plan to its Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris agreement – is consistent with China’s longer-term development trajectories. Otherwise, it is all too easy to continue kicking the same can down the road indefinitely.

There's no disincentive to prescribe our product, because the patient isn't going to be out of pocket any more than they would if they were taking a regular branded triptan.

The national average home price also set another October record at $607,250, up 15.2 per cent from the same month last year. Excluding sales in Greater Vancouver and the Greater Toronto Area, two of the most active and expensive housing markets, lowers the national average price by more than $127,000, CREA said.
 The housing market has been playing catch up this summer and fall from COVID-19 shutdowns that dampened the usually busy spring housing market. Shaun Cathcart, CREA’s senior economist, said that realtors may also be seeing a lot of moves, or “churn in the market,” that would not have happened if not for COVID-19.
 “As we’ve moved through the last few months of headline-grabbing data, we’ve seen sales activity for the year-to-date not just catch up with last year, which was surprising enough, but at this point activity in 2020 has a real shot at setting an annual record,” said Cathcart.
 “Many reasons have been suggested for why this is when many traditional drivers of the market, economic growth, employment and confidence in particular, are currently so weak. Something worth considering is how many households are choosing to pull up stakes and move as a result of COVID-19.”

"I assumed she was untouchable," said Deitz, who worked with Haspel at the CIA in the early 2000s. "But I have colleagues more knowledgeable than I am who think she's going to get bounced."
 He added that he was concerned "in a very personal way" about Trump's decision to install Michael Ellis, a former White House official and aide to California congressman Devin Nunes, as the NSA's new general counsel. US intelligence agencies are traditionally meant to be insulated from political forces, and NSA lawyers, in particular, are responsible for ensuring the agency doesn't use its vast electronic and cyber surveillance powers to target Americans.
 "There haven't been that many general counsels at the NSA, and we meet from time to time. I know all of them, and every single one of us is nonpartisan," Deitz said. "There were certainly some Republicans and some Democrats, but by and large, there were no partisans. There weren't any drum beaters, and this guy, Michael Ellis, he's precisely the kind of person you don't want at the agency."
 The Washington Post reported that Ellis' appointment to the most powerful legal role at the nation's premier surveillance agency was made under pressure from the White House. A former Republican political operative, Ellis is a staunch Trump loyalist and played a leading role in the White House's effort to stonewall the publication of former national security adviser John Bolton's book. One former National Security Council official later accused Ellis and others of hijacking the review process for the book and making false claims to stop its publication while Trump attacked Bolton as a traitor and a liar.

Rising adoption of cloud data centers owing to their lower costs is expected to act as an inhibitor to the market growth. Smaller organizations are increasingly adopting cloud services as they offer scalable low costs, there is no need of an IT staff, and have comparatively fewer overheads.

Owing to the aforementioned features, enterprises are still adopting colocation services.

Launching, growing and maintaining a successful business is an almost impossible task at the best of times. If it were easy everyone would do it.
 The truth is that behind every triumph is 1pc great idea and 99pc blood, sweat and tears. And the last few years have been anything but normal.
 The business community has been on tenterhooks since 2016. It matters not which way anyone voted in the hugely divisive Brexit referendum now but the uncertainty that it has caused business rumbles on. And yet this region’s business community continues to prosper.
 In January came more unwelcome news as a then little understood outbreak of some strange illness in China began to spread. No one could have predicted the wave of chaos and destructive that engulfed each and every one of us in the intervening months.
 Yes, there are reasons to be hopeful, there is a faint light at the end of a still very considerable tunnel. But 2020 was as much about survival as growth.
 And yet, again, this region’s business community hunkered down and got to work – even if more often than not it was on a Zoom call from the living room with the cat obscuring the camera.
 Never before in peacetime has Suffolk’s businesses faced such a challenge.
 I was flabbergasted by the quality of entries to the Suffolk Business Awards this year. In what has been a unremittingly bleak year these awards proved a very bright point. Your stories, your endeavours your sheer hard graft is truly inspiring.

Sources acknowledged that these activities have been carried out, primarily, by those unscrupulous elements who have exploited the ease of doing business conveniences in the existing system by getting a GST registration easily and quickly and later take advantage of the liberalised norm for grant of registration in GST.   Sources said that the GST Council's Law Committee would consider the impact of the issuances of fake invoices and strict actions/measures required under the GST law to curb these activities.   The Committee would also do some out of the box thinking on this issue as at present the only way to curb this illegal activity is to identify the chain of entities involved in the issuance of fake invoices and availment of credit and take strict action against them for preventing such fraud, including arresting the masterminds who run the whole network of firms and indulge in passing on fake credit.   The sources said that the Committee would deliberate on measures that are required to plug loopholes in the law which are being exploited by the unscrupulous elements to defraud the exchequer. It is learnt that the Finance Ministry is in the process of plugging these gaps in the GST registration process to ensure that only genuine businesses get a GST registration and those, who have intent to defraud the system, are purged out at the registration stage itself.   Sources explained that the businesses, whose owners or promoters do not have commensurate financial track record, like filing of income tax returns and payment of income tax to the Government, may require detailed physical and financial verification by tax officers, before their companies can be considered for GST registration. The provisions related to deemed registration under GST law may also be tightened to prevent misuse of such provisions by fake dealers.   Besides, the provisions related to the suspension of registration may also be streamlined to make the procedure of suspension and cancellation of registration more efficient and faster, so that such fraud operators can be prevented in time from continuing to pass on fake credit down the chain, added a source.   It is also learnt that data analytics techniques will be used to identify such taxpayers, who are suspected to be indulging in fraudulent activities and coordinated action is likely to be taken against such elements by suspending their registration, followed by detailed physical and financial verification by field officers to check the genuineness of their operations before they are allowed to reuse their registration.

Di Stefano, nell’intervista ad “Agenzia Nova”, affronta poi il tema della Libia. A suo modo di vedere, il Foro di dialogo politico libico concluso ieri a Tunisi senza accordo sul nuovo governo “non è un rallentamento politico”, ma anzi un’accelerazione se si considera la situazione in Libia “soltanto due mesi fa”. “Io non vedo nessun rallentamento politico. Se guardiamo soltanto a due mesi fa qualunque passaggio che si sta facendo è un’accelerazione”, ha detto Di Stefano. “Io credo che oggi la Libia, con tutti gli scongiuri del caso, non tornerà al caos di qualche mese fa.

Hi, good morning, and thanks for the questions. First off from me, just want to come to the Canadian market, particularly on the finished formulations which saw some increase quarter over quarter. Just looking at the vape market overall, you mentioned some highlights with BC and Ontario, you’ll be getting into Quebec. Just wondering what you’re seeing right now in terms of the vape competition - it looks like we’re seeing some pricing pressure within the market, so wanted to know how you feel about the pricing of your own finished formulation products that you have with your white label partners and how you feel like that’s evolving and how it might impact the gross margin profile. Thanks.

Yes. Thanks, Craig. So what I would say is the -- let me sort of back up maybe for a second here. So we've gone to arbitration under a set of agreements. Under those set of agreements, arbitration is the mechanism that governs to resolve the issue. It is a binding process, a binding outcome at the end of the day. I think we said before, it is expected to take between 3 to 4 -- 3 to 5 months, something on those lines. That doesn't mean that, of course, we could never get to that stage if we were to agree anything beforehand. But the process as envisaged is that we go to arbitration, it takes about 3 to 5 months, and ultimately, the result will be binding on both parties.

The evolution should continue to ramp. Obviously the number represented there was the fact that up until domestically we projected 70,000 patients throughout this year in 2020, we hit that number in September, and you look at the doubling month on month of patient acceptance through the prescription process, which is a special access scheme, but next year specifically the big ramp in 2021 is that over-the-counter process, so CBD specifically is going to be de-scheduled and that’s going to be over the counter, so you’ll be able to go into your pharmacy and you’ll be able to talk to your pharmacist and be able to access CBD products.
