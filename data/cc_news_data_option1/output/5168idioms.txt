RIDGWAY — A Bradford man has been jailed on a felony rape charge after an alleged incident that occurred in Ridgway Township Dec. 9.
 Richard Charles Buterbaugh III, 28, of Bradford, is charged with rape by forcible compulsion, a felony in the first degree, simple assault and harassment.
 On Dec. 10, a woman came to the Ridgway State Police station to report that Buterbaugh had forcibly raped her Dec. 9 in the bedroom of her residence in Ridgway Township.
 The woman told police she and Buterbaugh had been together for about seven months. At the time, she was asleep in her bed, when Buterbaugh allegedly woke her up by yelling at her due to a text he saw on her phone, according to the affidavit of probable cause. Buterbaugh reportedly got on the bed with the victim and became physical, to which she allegedly told him she couldn’t breathe.
 Buterbaugh allegedly said, “If you’re not going to have sex with me, I’m going to take it,” to which the victim said “No.” Buterbaugh then allegedly held her down and forced himself on her, as she tried to fight and get away, according to the affidavit of probable cause.
 After the incident, the woman called Buterbaugh a rapist, and he then allegedly punched her, according to the affidavit of probable cause.
 The woman and Buterbaugh engaged in an argument Dec. 10, when she wanted to know why he allegedly raped her the night before. He then grabbed her, threatening to do it once again, according to the affidavit of probable cause.
 Buterbaugh is confined in the Elk County Jail in lieu of $25,000 bail. His preliminary hearing is set for Jan. 20 at Martin’s office.

DuBOIS — Some athletes have the skills and mental fortitude necessary to start from the get-go when they reach the varsity level as a freshman or sophomore, while others must put in extra work to earn playing time.
 DuBois senior Jordin Sommers is someone who fell into that latter category, and thanks to his hard work, saw himself go from battling for time at the junior varsity level as a sophomore to being a varsity starter in a span of two-plus years in the only sport he competes in — basketball.
 “My sophomore year, I was scared to start out on the JV team,” said Sommers. “But, I decided to work my butt off thanks to my coach always helping and pushing me forward all the time. Now because of that I, am sitting at a great starting spot on our varsity team and improving still to this day.”
 Sommers said his drive to work hard came from his father, Jeremiah Sommers.
 “My role model is my father because he never had the greatest life growing up and got into very bad stuff when I was young,” said Sommers. “But, about four or five years ago he decided he needed change, so he moved to Florida. He is now having an amazing life in Miami with a great job. I still talk to him on a daily basis even though we’re thousands of miles apart.”
 Sommers hard work at the JV level as a sophomore eventually earned him enough varsity time that season to earn a letter as part of a Beavers team that went 15-9.
 Last year as a junior, Sommers turned into one of DuBois’ top reserves off the bench and was one of six Beavers to play in all 23 games on a team went 19-4. Those 19 wins were the most for a Beavers squad in 19 years and finished just two two shy of the all-time record (21) in program history since DuBois Area High School was formed as part of a merger in 1965.
 Sommers scored 99 points on the season to go along with 50 rebounds, 35 assists and 14 steals.
 That season also produced Sommers’ favorite game he has played in on the court.
 “We beat undefeated Elk Count Catholic (52-43 at DuBois), and it is my favorite memory because it was my best game all season,” said Sommers. “I had never beaten them since I started playing them in 7th grade, and I had a lot of fans come up to me and tell me how good I did in the game.”

MADISON, Wis. (AP) — State health officials say Wisconsin could receive 100,000 doses of the Moderna coronavirus vaccine as early as next week. That's twice what the state received in its initial shipment from Pfizer. While frontline health care workers started receiving doses of the Pfizer vaccine this week, another priority group is people in long-term care facilities. The state Department of Health Services has activated a federal partnership with pharmacy chains that would distribute vaccines to long-term care facilities. Pharmacy chains CVS and Walgreens will administer vaccines to nursing home residents and workers. State officials hope this could be done by the end of January, Wisconsin Public Radio reported. Once pharmacy chains get the vaccine from the federal government, they will set up inoculation timetables for each facility in Wisconsin. Nursing homes are going over details with the Department of Health Services on when and how this will happen. Consent of long-term care residents or their representatives will be needed before any vaccinations are given, possibly as early as Dec. 28. Health officials say there are approximately 28,000 nursing home residents and at least that many staff in Wisconsin. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to green light the Moderna vaccine, possibly this week. The Moderna vaccine is easier to handle than the one from Pfizer because it does not need to be kept in the deep freeze at minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 70 Celsius).

Weaving comedy and thriller, “Whiskey on the Rocks” is impressed by a infamous incident that very practically escalated right into a full-blown struggle between Sweden and the USSR. In 1981, a Soviet U-137 ‘Whisky’-class submarine ran aground on rocks deep inside Swedish territorial waters — proper in the course of a delicate Swedish naval train. This excessive breach of sovereignty led to a Chilly Struggle stand-off between Sweden and the USSR that took 11 days of high-stakes negotiation to resolve.

The captain would be an unimaginable loss on and off the field but he's 29 and next season will be the last on his contract. It's astounding there hasn't been more interest in the Englishman over the years given his output but this term has seen him develop even further. Steven Gerrard will be desperate to see his captain sign a new long-term deal and put any speculation to bed. Of all the players in the team, he is the one you would regard as irreplaceable.

The Mandalorian season 2 episode 7 saw the eponymous gunslinger take his helmet off for only the second time across the series, which understandably caused a lot of excitement online. Considering Din Djarin follows a strict creed which means he can never show his face, the choice was a surprising one – and a sign of how much he cares about baby Grogu, to the point that he’s willing to break his most important rule to get the Child back.
 A rumour has circulated before that Pedro Pascal is keen to remove his helmet more, though the actor rebuffed the speculation on BBC’s The One Show
 “That is not true, actually,” Pascal said. “It’s a really wonderful way of telling the story, it’s always been a very clear creed for the character and the collaborative process of the whole thing has been– we’ve all been on the same page with this, so I, you know, what I want is for them to make the best show possible however they get that done.”
 Since Din has met Bo-Katan Kryze and her pals, as well as Boba Fett, who all remove their helmets, it does seem likely that Mando will eventually get comfortable showing his face more often. Baby Yoda also seemed curious about catching a glimpse of what was under the helmet when the duo drank soup together, and if there’s one thing we’re sure not even Din Djarin can resist, it’s Grogu’s puppy eyes.
 Pascal also playfully rejected the nickname the internet has lovingly bestowed on Baby Yoda: “I don’t know what you’re talking about. I know Grogu and the Child.”
 Whether the rescue mission surely on its way for Grogu – currently in the clutches of the chilling Moff Gideon – ends with Din removing his helmet or not, we’re all hoping the duo will at least be reunited. Could anyone handle a cliffhanger that leaves the two separated?
 Check out our The Mandalorian season 2 release schedule to make sure you don’t miss the series finale.
