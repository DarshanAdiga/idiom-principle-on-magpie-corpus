The airport has been around since the early days of aviation and before there was a commercial airport in Dane County. Established in 1923, the Lone Rock Airport, as it was called then, was designated in 1927 as an emergency airmail landing field because it was located halfway between Chicago and Minneapolis. At the time, what is now the Dane County Regional Airport was a cabbage patch and Royal Airport was just getting up and running in Monona at what is now South Towne.

“Retrosexual: when you hook up with an ex during Mercury retrograde and blame it on the stars,” read the image Kail, 28, shared. The quote itself was playful, but her complicated relationship with her ex is nothing to laugh about. Kail’s romance with Lux’s father was frequently on and off, and it included cheating allegations and a protective order. The parents also regularly took to social media to throw shade at each other.

She also seemed to hint they were done for good while talking to _Us Weekly_. “It’s hurtful. … When I loved someone so hard, it was devastating to know he was capable of hurting me to the extent that he has,” she said in March. “When someone can lie through their teeth so well … I fell for it, only to find out later my gut was right all along.”

Accra, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 11th Jul, 2020 ) :A small group of visitors waits eagerly at the entrance to a single-storey building in Ghana's capital Accra, looking to explore the literary treasure inside.
 This is the Library of Africa and the African Diaspora -- a passion project launched by Ghanaian-British writer Sylvia Arthur.
 Based around Arthur's personal book collection, the library provides a remarkable opportunity to bring literature from the global black community to a country considered a cradle of African civilization, and which was once a hub of the transatlantic slave trade.
 "Our work has been neglected, it's not been showcased, it's not been respected, it's not been archived and that's the purpose of this library," Arthur said as she guided her visitors around. The library was founded in 2017 when Arthur moved to Ghana after working in Europe.
 It was renamed and relaunched this year, welcoming its first guests again in July as restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus were eased in the west African nation.
 The library boasts around 4,000 books, from almost every country on the African continent.
 Many Names will be familiar to those who have seen the growing international acclaim for African writers such as Wole Soyinka, Chinua Achebe, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Ben Okri, Mariama Ba and Ngugi wa Thiong'o.
 But this collection is a rarity in Africa.
 It not only spans the entire continent, including authors such as Assia Djebar from Algeria and Naguib Mahfouz from Egypt, as well as white authors from southern Africa such Doris Lessing, Nadine Gordimer and J.M. Coetzee -- it also includes black writers from across the world including the US, Caribbean and Europe.
 It also has a special collection of rare and out-of-print books, drawing historical links between the works of African and diaspora writers, and offers residences for authors from abroad.
 "We started off in one room and now we are in a whole house," Arthur said.
 \- Black Lives Matter - The library's aims have been made even more relevant by the Black Lives Matter protests that have swept the globe and sparked renewed debates on history and equality.

The Hague, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 11th Jul, 2020 ) :Twenty-five years after the Srebrenica massacre international courts like those which tried the perpetrators of the slaughter face an uncertain future but are needed more than ever, experts say.
 The now-defunct war crimes tribunal that convicted Bosnian Serb leaders like Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic over the murder of 8,000 Muslim men and boys was hailed at the time as a new era of post-Cold War accountability.
 Yet the numerous courts set up in its wake now face a litany of problems like low conviction rates, attacks by US President Donald Trump and antagonistic governments, and accusations of racism.
 They also need to start giving justice to victims of a new generation of crimes such as the war in Syria, the repression of the Rohingya people in Myanmar and the persecution of the Uighurs in China, experts said.
 The Srebrenica commemoration was a reminder that the need for such tribunals to tackle mass atrocities "has never been greater," said Nancy Combs, law professor at the William and Mary Law school in Virginia.
 \- 'Considerable difficulties' - The Hague in the Netherlands \-- dubbed the "city of peace and justice" -- plays host to many of these tribunals, the biggest of which is the International Criminal Court, set up in 2002 to try the world's worst crimes.
 It is also home to a tribunal for Kosovo which recently handed down war crimes charges against President Hashim Thaci, and a tribunal for the assassination of former Lebanese premier Rafiq Hariri in 2005.
 But the ICC is now under attack by the Trump administration for probing alleged war crimes in Afghanistan, while the wheels of justice have turned slowly and expensively at both the Kosovo and Lebanon courts.
 "Undoubtedly, these tribunals are experiencing considerable difficulties at present," said Combs.
 "At this moment in history, the future of war crimes tribunals is uncertain." The ICC was also "suffering from a crisis of confidence because its successes have been so meagre in the last decade," Combs told AFP.
 The court had to drop a crimes against humanity case against Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta, while the acquittals of former Ivorian president Laurent Gbagbo and Congolese politician Jean-Pierre Bemba came as severe blows.
