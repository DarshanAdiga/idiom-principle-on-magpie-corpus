TERRILLON Maurice (Moe)September 3, 1936 - October 23, 2020It is with deep sadness that we announce the passing of our father, grandpa, uncle, and friend Maurice Terrillon.Maurice was born on Kings Road in North Vancouver, the youngest in a family of 10 siblings. His parents were married in 1911, and made their home in upper Lonsdale, emigrating from France, to Manitoba and then North Vancouver in 1912. Maurice is pre-deceased by his parents Felix and Eugenie Terrillon and all his siblings, except for his brother Bob. Maurice was a family man, a caring husband and a wonderful father and grandfather. He is survived by his loving wife Adele, daughters, Jacqueline (Craig), Karen (John), and Monique (Kevin), grandchildren Alexandra, Jack, Raymond, and Charles, as well as many nieces and nephews and his extended Mousset family in France.Maurice graduated from North Van High in 1955 and went on to work in sales at Fleck Bros. in Vancouver. He was an experienced fastball player and pitched for many teams in Vancouver. In his younger days as a teen he hunted up Mosquito Creek and Grouse Mtn. with his many brothers, and had annual hunting expeditions every year.In 1957 Maurice married his sweetheart Adele Zerbe, whom he met at Fleck Bros., and together they went on to raise a family of three daughters, and would have celebrated their 63rd wedding anniversary in Nov.Maurice coached his daughters through their years in softball, taking them to tournaments and all the while displaying the patience that we all loved about him. He continued to coach his grandchildren from the sidelines, whether it was soccer, baseball, dance, or hockey.One of his joys was to be at their family cabin on the Sunshine Coast where he loved making his special crepes for breakfast, puttering around, playing crib with his grandchildren, going crabbing, and enjoying summer days. He looked forward to his travels with Adele to Maui and Palm Springs. Moe was an avid Montreal Canadiens fan, a gardener, a reader and liked wood working with cedar logs found on the beach. He helped Adele make wine, and he especially liked collecting "stuff", often holding his famous garage sales.In his later years he would collect bottles and became a regular in his community on collection day. He made many new friends doing this. He was a gentle man who always had time to lend a hand, help out a neighbour, or watch the children play sports.Maurice loved animals, dogs, cats, deer, birds that hit his window, hummingbirds, and had a special affection for Lady and Savary.We are deeply grateful for the kindness of the emergency doctors and nurses at Lions Gate Hospital who cared for our father so genuinely.Maurice touched the lives of so many people. A celebration of his life will be held in the Spring of 2021, when it is safe to do so. Online condolences may be made at www.dignitymemorial.ca. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in his name to the Juvenile Diabetes (JDRF) at www.jdrf.ca.He will be dearly missed and also celebrated, for a life well lived and a legacy of kindness, patience, and generosity.

The School of Education, IGNOU on Wednesday celebrated the National Education Day by organising a lecture on "Significance of National Education Day in the light of the National Education Policy, 2020" through virtual mode. The keynote address on the occasion was delivered by the chief guest professor Ved Prakash, former chairperson of UGC. The presidential address was delivered by Prof. Nageshwar Rao, vice chancellor of IGNOU.The chief guest, Prof. Ved Prakash, through his address critically analysed the new education policy 2020 and noted that the policy has made a couple of notable structural changes. He cautioned that the implementation is the key and the recommendations made in the policy document would need to be followed- up. He appreciated that the NEP talks about all institutions of higher learning being ready with an institutional development plan by 2030 so that they can be multidisciplinary institutions by 2040. He recommended inter- disciplinarity in higher education institutions instead. He also talked about NEP recommendations with regard to setting up of research-intensive universities, teaching- intensive universities and degree-granting colleges. On doubling the gross enrolment ratio in higher education, he observed that massification of higher education will not entirely depend upon strengthening of higher education but it will have to be synergised with school education. He also referred to the need of the National Higher Education Qualification Framework in the NEP 2020.The vice chancellor, Prof. Nageshwar Rao, in his presidential address said that the goal of reaching 50% GER cannot be achieved through the conventional mode of higher education and Open and Distance Education would have to be geared up to realize the set goal while providing employment relevant and quality education. He also outlined IGNOU's initiatives with regard to the integrated ODL and Online Education which is an important dimension of the NEP, 2020.Prof D Venkateshwarlu, director, SOE said, "The National Education Policy 2020 is a policy of the 21st century which aims to address the many developmental imperatives of our country. This policy proposes the revision and revamping of all aspects of education, including its structure, regulation and governance. It intends to create a new system that is aligned with the aspirational goals of the 21st century education, and the SDG- 4, for ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and providing life-long learning opportunities for all, while building upon India's traditions and value systems.' He hoped that the deliberations would help in effective implementations of the NEP 2020 by all the stakeholders. He also thanked Prof. Nageshwar Rao, VC IGNOU for his support to the initiatives of the school.Prof. Satyakam, Pro-VC IGNOU in his speech on the day talked about the Indian values and cultural aspects which are an integral part of the new policy. Prof. RP Das, Pro-Vc IGNOU in his address laid importance on the implementation part and said it would need coordinated effort between the center and the states to realise its true potential.

By Nikunj Dalmia The last few years have been challenging for growth in aggregate and that is why we are seeing record premiums for companies that have delivered growth even in this environment, says Prashant Jain , ED & CIO, HDFC AMC . Till about a couple of years ago, a large part of earnings in India was a function of crony capitalism, inflation and rupee depreciation. Those factors are not at play. What would be the driving factors now for corporate India?The last few years have been challenging for aggregate earnings because in the last few years, something or the other has been impacting aggregate earnings. Banks’ earnings were impacted for a few years due to corporate NPAs. Some large companies, let us say Tata Motors, took a big impairment. So once in a while, some companies had some challenging situations; steel companies went through a bad patch. The last few years have been challenging for growth in aggregate and that is why we are seeing record premiums for companies that have delivered growth even in this environment. As I look ahead, while the consumer sector, the pharmaceuticals, IT, banks were not impacted by the asset quality cycle, they will continue to grow earnings. This may be a bit lower than what we experienced in the last few years because in the last few years, we have also seen a significant margin improvement and overall credit growth is down due to lower inflation. As we look ahead, the earnings could become more broad-based. For example, metals, capex, the erstwhile corporate banks should continue to grow. Utilities should post fairly strong performance over the next few years. The power demand in India has been the first to recover and in September, power demand grew in double digits. People do not look at power as a growth sector in India but it is indeed a growth sector because just 5% homes in India have access to air conditioning and the moment you install a one-room air conditioner at home, power consumption literally doubles. Our power consumption per capita is one of the lowest in the world. So, even utilities should participate. I expect a fairly broad-based earnings growth going forward. China used to drive metal prices lower but it has become an importer now and they are not impacting the metal prices at all. How long this will last we do not know, but in the foreseeable future, the outlook for metal companies continues to be pretty decent. Cement companies have done extremely well. Costs have gone down and I would expect a fairly broad-based earnings recovery. The sectors which may continue to get impacted, compared to last year, are retail, multiplexes and airlines. These sectors may take slightly longer to reach the earnings that they were experiencing pre Covid. Are we in for a good patch in IT for the next couple of years?As far as business growth is concerned, there is greater clarity. Business growth should be good because the whole world is rushing to adopt digital with a sense of urgency and Indian companies are extremely well placed to benefit from that. Indian companies have been able to perform admirably even when they adopted work from home and I do not think some other vendors globally would have achieved that level of success. This has added to the credibility of these companies. The moment you work from home, it works even in an onsite situation when there is an increasing tendency to move the work offshore to save a lot of money. This whole trend of working from home and adoption of digital have helped companies save considerably on travel and marketing costs and use it partially on technology. All of this is supportive for continued growth of Indian IT companies. The market also knows this and that is why the multiples are rich. The IT stocks have been trading at close to peak multiples. This is a fairly large sector and so while growth rates could move up by 1-2-3%, I do not think it is easy to make a case that growth rates will move up materially and sustainably for these fairly high multiples to sustain. However, if you compare this sector with the FMCG stocks, the growth profile, the ROCE profile, the free cash flow profile and the growth rates are similar and even the dividend payout ratios are quite similar. But the multiples are much lower compared to the consumer-oriented stocks and therefore, even at somewhat higher multiples, the dividend yields are quite respectable at 3-5%. Compare that with the cost of capital today, it is not difficult to justify even these multiples. ESG funds are getting inflows right now. ESG means focus on environment, social and corporate governance. Is that an impediment for funds like yours as you have exposure to NTPC and ITC? We are also thinking about this every day. I do find a few inconsistencies in these arguments. After all a car or a truck is burning petrol or diesel which is a hydrocarbon. How is that different from burning coal? In India, the peak power demand on every single day is between 5 and 9 pm in the evening. At that time, there is no sun and it costs Rs 10 or more to store a single unit of power and that is two to three times the cost of power itself. So till the time storage becomes economically viable, who is going to pay this Rs 10 extra for power? I am not saying we should not care about the environment. I am all for it. When it comes to social, I think it is extremely subjective. The issue is exactly the same as a thermal company. For a moment, let us assume that India does not produce coal power, then what happens? Will the 1.3 billion people go without power? Does that not have social costs? I think it is very easy to give opinions on these issues without looking at the ground realities. The reality on the ground is that coal demand in India and the demand for thermal power will continue to grow for considerable periods of time. India will actually need to invest in a few more thermal power plants. Only when power storage becomes very competitive, which could be five-ten years down the line, will you have a viable alternative to thermal power. I find little difference between burning petrol-diesel or coal as both are hydrocarbons. I think it is a phase. It will pass because ultimately if a stock is going to pay back in five years and the life of that business is beyond that, no one else is interested in buying that stock. The company ideally should keep on buying back its stock. Also as solar power becomes more competitive and more relevant, I do not see a reason why the existing thermal power generators could not move into solar power. NTPC has already announced that by 2030, 30% of their power would be generated from non-thermal sources. Last time when interest rates were this low, it kickstarted a housing boom, a demand for HFCs and an auto boom. Do you think the same cycle will repeat itself this time also?Prices track earnings growth over very long periods of time but they could divert significantly over even 5-10 years. The utility stocks are a fraction of what they were 10 years back though businesses have tripled or even quadrupled. Business growth itself all the time does not mean stocks will simply mimic it. Ten years back, people were willing to pay three times price to book or utilities which were down and everyone lost money but we know popular IPOs came in utilities at that time. People were not willing to buy FMCG and pharma 12 years back. It sounds bizarre today but that is how the markets were. Lower interest rates are good for home sales, automobile sales and for capex growth over time as also credit growth. Over time, due to the focus of the government, due to the large manufacturing opportunities that India has and as people are trying to derisk the supply chain away from China due to Covid related stress plus India having an intense focus on indigenising to reduce imports, growth will come back. We should not ignore the valuations because if you bought IT in 2000 for very long periods, you made no money despite the fact that the businesses grew every single year. If you bought pharma around 2013-2014 you are down 50-70% even today because the businesses were overvalued. For successful investing over long periods, business and growth are very important but equally important is what prices we are paying for this.

(WDAM) - Jones County Circuit Clerk Concetta Brooks says a large number of voters showed up to the polls on Election Day.“We had some, just a little over 30,000 that showed up to vote, which was about 68, a little over 68%. And as long as I’ve been working or affiliated with the circuit clerk’s office, it’s never been that high,” Brooks said. “We had a great turnout.”In addition to a high voter turnout, Brooks says more than 4,000 residents voted absentee.“We probably had maybe somewhere over a little 1,000 that was actually mailed out, but our in-house voting was tremendous this year,” Brooks said. “A little over 3,000 that came into the office to vote absentee.”She says many voters with coronavirus showed up to their precincts on Election Day and were able to cast their votes from their vehicles.“Overall, I’m very proud of our poll workers and how they handled and worked under this stress of the COVID,” Brooks said. “All day long I never got a call for an issue from anyone.”Brooks says they will have to do it again in two weeks for the justice court judge District 2 special election runoff.“There were four candidates in that race and neither one of them got 50% plus one, so the top two, which is Noel Rogers and Sonny Saul, their names will be on the ballot for the runoff,” Brooks said.She says absentee voting for the runoff started Tuesday.“We’re encouraging people to come in and vote if they’re going to be out of town for the week of Thanksgiving,” Brooks said. “Otherwise, we’ll see them at the polls hopefully on November 24.”Brooks say her office will also be open the next two Saturdays, Nov. 14 and Nov. 21, from 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. for registered voters in the district who qualify to vote absentee.“That 68% we had on November the 3, we’d love to have a high percentage for that district to come out,” Brooks said.Brooks says her office will have complete election results on Thursday, Nov. 12, after counting all mail-in absentee ballots they received on Nov. 10. The office will be closed for Veterans Day.Copyright 2020 WDAM. All rights reserved.

Bukayo Saka admits he and his Arsenal team-mates could not keep Jack Grealish quiet at the weekend despite specifically analysing the Aston Villa captain ahead of the game. Grealish was one of the star performers as Villa left the Emirates Stadium with a well-deserved 3-0 victory to move within three points of the Premier League summit.The 25-year-old has enjoyed an impressive season to date and could make his second England start when they face the Republic of Ireland in a Wembley friendly on Thursday night. Saka highlighted Grealish as the most impressive player he saw during his first senior international camp last month.He then revealed Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and his coaches looked at ways to stem Grealish&rsquo;s impact on Sunday – although any plans clearly had little effect.&ldquo;He is a top player,&rdquo; Saka, who scored an own goal in the game, said when asked about Grealish.&ldquo;When I came here before in my first camp he was probably the player who impressed me the most in training.&ldquo;Before we played against Villa at the weekend we did analyse him and we picked him out as one of their main threats and he showed it in the game.&ldquo;He was amazing from start to finish so it is going to be good to play with him and not against him this week.&rdquo;The defeat to Villa leaves Arsenal in the bottom half of the table, having now lost four of their opening eight league games. Saka, who like Grealish will be pushing for another chance to impress for the Three Lions this week, said England boss Gareth Southgate told him to use this time to clear his head of the result.&ldquo;He just asked me how the (Villa) game was, how I was feeling about it,&rdquo; Saka told beIN Sports.&ldquo;I just told him how I was disappointed that the result wasn&rsquo;t so good and that we will bounce back after.&ldquo;But he told me it was an opportunity for me to focus here, get that out of the way, clear my head and just have a positive week here with England. &ldquo;After the game the boss (Arteta) did say to us that this is the beauty of this sport, that we will experience many highs and lows.&ldquo;Last season when we came back from lockdown we lost two games in a row and things were looking really difficult for us.&ldquo;But if you look at how we finished the season we won the FA Cup so we went from low to high really quick, we just have to keep going, keep our heads down.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here with England now so just want to focus on that and we will take the games in our stride when we get back with Arsenal – I&rsquo;m sure we will do, 100 per cent.&rdquo;

The two brothers jumped aside to save themselves."Soon after, the Bisoi brothers had an altercation with Suna and his friends. The two families were already at loggerheads over the last 4-5 years and had filed FIRs against each other. Suna left after the altercation only to return with some of his friends to Bisoi's house and started assaulting the two brothers, their parents and maternal uncle with sharp weapons," said Burla sub-divisional police officer Sishu Ranjan Mohapatra.It was after the miscreants left that locals informed the police who had admitted the family to Veer Surendra Sai Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (VIMSAR), Burla, where brothers Muna Bisoi (30) and Bulu Bisoi(34) died. Their father Pitabasa Bisoi (50), mother Sangita Bisoi (47), and maternal uncle Narendra Bhandekar (52) are critical.Police have detained the main accused and three other persons in this connection and seized the car allegedly used by them.

Clarke Central's final regular season football game scheduled for this week has been canceled by Johnson-Gainesville because of coronavirus-related issues, Clarke Central athletic director Jon Ward said Tuesday.
   
 The Gladiators' last week clinched the Region 8-5A title for the second year in a row with a win over Loganville, so this Friday's matchup was a moot point for any playoff seeding as Johnson (0-9, 0-6) isn't in contention.
   
 The school said it wasn't sure if it was a forfeited win for the Gladiators (7-2, 6-0), but it mattered not for them as they'll have two weeks off before hosting a first round playoff game on Nov. 27.
   
 The school said that its senior recognition ceremony will move to that week of the playoffs.
   
 Clarke Central, ranked ninth in Class 5A, started the season 1-2 but ran through its region with just one challenge, a 35-34 last-minute win over Eastside.
   
 Its two losses came against Oconee County (Class 3A) and Buford (Class 6A), both ranked second in their respective classes.
