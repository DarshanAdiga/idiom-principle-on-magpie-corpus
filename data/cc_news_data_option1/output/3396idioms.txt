This week, the Republican National Convention convened and devolved into a series of scare tactics meant to rile up President Trump’s base and be so outrageous that the rest of the country looks away from his and other Republican officials’, like Governor Mike Parson’s, disastrous, bumbling, and irresponsible responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, a pandemic that has infected nearly 77,000 Missourians and killed nearly 180,000 Americans.
 President Trump and the GOP turned the convention into a roundup of social media stars, harkening back to his reality TV days which favored shock and awe over substance. On Monday, Mark and Patricia McCloskey were featured speakers. The McCloskeys, who pointed guns at non-violent protesters marching for racial equity and criminal justice reform, used their time to continue the GOP’s attack on Black leaders and elected officials. President Trump and Missouri Republicans up and down the ballot have gone out of their way to attack Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner, leading to death threats. Cori Bush, poised to be the first Black woman to be elected to Congress in Missouri, was attacked for leading protests after the murder of George Floyd and stating that Black lives matter. Black elected officials in Missouri have been sent razor blades. They’ve received racist, misogynistic, and dehumanizing letters containing threats of lynching, of being “hunted” down.
 When Patricia McCloskey stated concern for “basic safety and security in our communities,” it was apparent she wasn’t talking about every community. She wasn’t referring to the basic safety and security for African American communities, who are facing disproportionate rates of infection and death from COVID-19.

The way schools look and operate will be wholly different come the fall amid the COVID-19 pandemic, but the inside of school buses will remain largely unchanged in regard to student spacing.


  The Student Transportation Service Consortium of Grey-Bruce, which provides school bus services to all schools for the Bluewater District School Board and Bruce-Grey Catholic School Board, have released their COVID-19 bus protocols.


  And while intense bus-cleaning schedules and COVID-19 etiquette are being stressed, students will not be physically distanced during their rides to school.


  "School bus resources, including vehicles and drivers, are not available to provide physical distancing on a school bus," the document reads.


  In the absence of physical distancing, parents are being asked to educate their children to sit together with their siblings when possible and to try and sit with other students in their class (cohort). Students are not supposed to sit in the seat directly behind the bus driver.


  Buses will have row numbers marked, and students will be asked to remember what row they sit in for contact-tracing purposes. Students are also being asked to sit in the same seat each day, if possible.


  All students from Grade 4 to Grade 12 will be required to wear a face mask at all times while on a school bus. Students from Junior Kindergarten to Grade 3 are highly encouraged to wear a mask.


  Any student that cannot wear a mask due to a medical or other special need must contact their school to get an exemption.


  While waiting for the bus, students and parents are asked to maintain a two- metre physical distance.


  "There are still measures to reduce the risk," said Grey Bruce's medical officer of health Dr. Ian Arra. "Maybe not as optimal as we want it to be . . . but there are measures."


  Arra said the inherent spacing provide by the bus seating and the important role of self-assessment should drastically reduce any potential virus transmission.


  "If there are two kids in one seat, that's not the end of the world. There are many other measures in place," Arra said. "These are very effective. If there are kids with symptoms they are not going to be boarding any school bus … and if they're sick, they're not going to infect the whole school bus. It's literally three people around them … and odds are there is not going to be transmission because of all the measures we talked about."


  On Aug. 25, Ontario's leading school bus driver's union, Unifor, released a statement calling on the provincial government to guarantee access to PPE and limit the number of passengers on the bus. Unifor also wants professional cleaners hired to sanitize the school buses.


  "Many of these drivers are senior citizens who in addition to being asked to put themselves on the frontline to safely transport an unknown amount of passengers each day are also worried about the responsibility of cleaning and sanitizing buses," said Unifor Ontario Regional Director Naureen Rizvi. "In some situations, they're being asked to perform the work of industrial cleaners, expected to use a variety of heavy-duty cleaning products. That is not part of their job description."


  Arra said he shares that concern, but there are measures put in place, and that can be put in place, to mitigate the risk.


  "Being concerned is the first step to mitigating the risk," Arra said. "It's true that adults are more likely to get a severe disease … are there measures we can put in place? Yes. Are we doing that? Absolutely. The seat behind the bus driver will be empty no matter what, and if there is a kid in the third row who is sick, really the distance is tremendous. The risk to the driver is calculated based on this."


  Both students and bus drivers will be required to conduct a daily self- assessment and not board the bus if they're experiencing any symptoms.


  However, young students with no parent present will be allowed to board the bus and be transported to school. The bus operator will advise the school of the situation and have the school follow its protocols.


  Students who develop symptoms while at school will be asked to have their parents pick them up, and not board the bus for the ride home.


  All bus drivers will be required to wear a face-covering while on the school bus. Bus drivers are asked to open the windows when possible for better ventilation.


  As for bus cleaning, high-touch surfaces will be cleaned at the end of the morning runs and at the end of the day. Those surfaces include the inside hand railing, back, top, and front of the seatbacks as well as the seat benches and the bus walls and windows.


  The driver's seat and controls will be cleaned after each run.


  Unifor wants those duties assigned to a professional cleaning company


  "These extra duties are added to the driver's core responsibility of safely driving a large commercial vehicle during the busiest times of traffic congestion. While the drivers are tasked with providing safe student transport,


  they remain classified as part-time workers with no health and welfare benefit protections," Unifor's release said.

The resolution also denounced the compact that students signed on LionPATH and asked that Penn State give students a refund on tuition in light of the fact that many classes are online. The resolution also asked that the university once again implement the optional alternative grading scale that was available in the spring semester.
 If classes are not moved online, the resolution asked that the university test 10% of students per day instead of 1%, create public contingency plans for potential campus closure, give student workers hazard pay, create clear policies for missed work for students who contract the coronavirus and expand online mental health resources.
 Though most representatives who spoke said they supported most of the resolution, the idea of closing on-campus housing generated sometimes heated debate.
 Joshua Reynolds said he didn’t know any students outside of UPUA who wanted to see Penn State’s campus close. Reynolds and Miller both said sending students home would be detrimental to students’ mental and social health.
 Annmarie Rounds-Sorensen supported the bill. She said she resigned from her post as RA after four days of being on campus and argued that closing campus will not hurt students’ mental health. YuNa Choi argued that closing campus now is the only way to avoid doing so in the spring.
 Lakyn Meeder argued that the university should not let students choose whether to be on campus. Although some students will choose to stay on campus for valid mental health reasons, Meeder said, others will choose to stay to go to parties, or simply for “the college experience,” which is not worth sacrificing other students’ health.
 During the debate, representatives passed an amendment removing the recommendation that Penn State close on-campus housing, much to the dismay of Robertson and Jacob Klipstein.
 Eventually, Adeline Mishler moved to table the resolution because she felt passing or failing it with so much internal disagreement would send mixed messages to administrators. The resolution was tabled, and the UPUA will return to it at a later date.

The NBA was shut down Wednesday when the Milwaukee Bucks, the NBA team from Wisconsin’s largest city, decided to boycott its playoff game against the Orlando Magic.
 The other two playoff games scheduled for Wednesday were also postponed, but TNT still decided to air its postgame show “Inside the NBA” even though there were no games. This was a situation that called for analysis and commentary and TNT realized it.
 Smith, who was on TNT’s panel along with host Ernie Johnson and analysts Shaquille O’Neal and Charles Barkley, decided that he wasn’t in the proper frame of mind to talk about the boycott.
 “And for me, I think the biggest thing now as a Black man, as a former player, I think it’s best for me to support the players and not be here tonight,” Smith said.
 He unplugged his microphone and started to walk off the set in a move that seemed to take everyone on the show by surprise. O’Neal and Barkley stayed in their chairs while Smith departed.
 TNT could have gone to a commercial at that point. Instead, the cameras stayed glued to Smith as he left the studio.
 That was effective commentary by Smith — he decided to let Wednesday’s boycott speak for itself by leaving.
 We’ve seen panelists walk out of the studio before, including an incident on ABC’s “The View” when Whoopi Goldberg and Joy Behar left the set because they were angry at guest Bill O’Reilly.
 However, those exits resulted from an argument. Smith’s exit came because he wanted to support the players, not go about business as usual.
 Four baseball games were also postponed Wednesday, including the Milwaukee Brewers game, and a nationally televised game on ESPN between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants.
 The WNBA postponed its schedule. Major League Soccer postponed its schedule.

  Para conseguir Megaenergia, você vai precisar batalhar em Reides Mega. A quantidade de Megaenergia que você recebe corresponde ao tempo que você leva para terminar a batalha. Quanto mais rápido vencer a batalha, mais Megaenergia você recebe do Pokémon que derrotou.


  Batalhas de Reide Especiais com Pokémon Megaevoluídos vão aparecer aleatoriamente, e alguns eventos terão Batalhas de Reide mais fortes. As Reides Mega serão, no entanto, diferentes das Reides normais, e terão seus próprios níveis de dificuldade.


  É possível que a Megaenergia também venha como recompensa de mais Pesquisas Especiais no futuro, quando mais Pokémon tiverem suas Megaevoluções disponíveis. Pode funcionar da mesma forma que as tarefas de Pesquisa que concedem Doces Pokémon.


  Uma Megaevolução só dura quatro horas, mas alguns eventos podem aumentar essa duração. Enquanto o Pokémon estiver em sua forma Mega, você pode batalhar em ginásios e Reides, mas você não pode usá-lo para defender ginásios nem na Liga de Batalha Go por enquanto.

The GOP has done all they can to take our eyes off the reasons why Americans are hurting. In the midst of an ongoing health and economic crisis, President Trump and Republicans are desperately trying to distract us from reality with lies. We cannot lift restrictions, open the gates to the economy, or return to in-person education without first addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Fear mongering and dog whistling about invasions of crime into the suburbs are just election-year talking points President Trump, Governor Parson, and Trump’s Republican Party are going to use, thinking they can scare you into voting for them. The reality, if Trump is re-elected, is much scarier. The president has given up on getting the pandemic under control, shrugging off deaths of Americans as “it is what it is.” Combine that careless and reckless attitude with the continued attack on the Affordable Care Act and the protections it offers for pre-existing conditions, millions of Americans could be facing the pandemic without affordable healthcare. Governor Parson, who has himself shrugged off the deaths due to COVID-19, has bragged about the savings Missouri saw from kicking over 100,000 children off their healthcare.
 Healthcare is on the ballot this November, leadership and decency is on the ballot this November. Together, we can elect leaders who will work to keep us safe, not distract us with gimmicks and rhetoric that feeds hate.

Chennai (Tamil Nadu) [India], Aug 27 (ANI/NewsVoir): The Jain International Trade Organization (JITO), Chennai has extended scholarships for the children of frontline COVID workers, medical staff, police personnel, and owners of small, struggling businesses to the tune of Rs. 80 lakhs.   JITO has also stepped up and offered a 100 per cent lifetime scholarship to the deceased front line warriors of the police force in the last 2 years. These scholarships were honored at the Commissioner's office by the respected Commissioner of Police, Greater Chennai, Mr. Mahesh Aggarwal.   In keeping with its ethos of serving the underprivileged, the Jain International Trade Organization (JITO) has launched several charitable initiatives to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in India. JITO arranged for the distribution of food packets and ration for close to 20,000 migrant families. The organization has spent close to Rs. 54 lakhs in their initiative to reach the affected families.   Priyadarshini, daughter of COVID Warrior, late Constable Murugan, Selayur Police station. She was first of the many students to receive the scholarship from Mr. Mahesh Aggarwal, Commissioner of Police, Greater Chennai.   Health Relief Efforts   The pandemic has acutely affected access to healthcare-related equipment and services. JITO has alleviated this issue by arranging for one ambulatory vehicle, one EV patient pick-up, PPE kits and video laryngoscopes equipment worth over 40 lakhs to government hospitals. Additionally, to address the safety concerns of health workers and frontline staff, JITO has donated PPE kits, sanitizers, and 3-Ply masks to the Police and Corporation Health departments. JITO also tied up with 3 hospitals (with 128-bed facility) for 45 days. The facilities come equipped with ICU and ventilators for COVID patients. This treatment and care was provided at a subsidized cost. Further, to broaden the reach of COVID treatment to as many people as possible, JITO arranged for Mission Zero (Clinic on wheels). As part of this initiative, the organization spent Rs. 24 lakhs to provide 30 buses and vans to the Chennai Corporation. This helped the Corporation's team of doctors and nurses to test nearly 45,000 patients.   Economic Relief Efforts   "COVID-19 is as much an economic issue as a medical one. JITO is addressing the immediate need for medical care and ration today with our relief efforts. Along with this, we are also ensuring that the wage earners and others impacted by loss of jobs are taken care of," said Doulat Jain, the Chairman of the Chennai chapter.   Close to Rs. 80 lakhs has been used to pay the salaries of people whose dues were not paid by employers due to the pandemic. A sum of Rs. 80 lakhs is being used to arrange for interest-free loan for economically challenged families.   JITO has always kept 'service to society' at the center of its operations. This is especially important today as JITO navigates its way to help the affected people in these uncertain times.   This story is provided by NewsVoir.

Dick Gremillion, the emergency director in Calcasieu Parish, said hours after landfall that they hadn't been able to get out and look for damage.
 "The wind is still over 50 mph. It's going to have to drop significantly before they can even run any emergency calls. We also need daylight," Gremillion said in an interview with KPLC-TV.
 More than 580,000 coastal residents were ordered to join the largest evacuation since the coronavirus pandemic began and many did, filling hotels and sleeping in cars since officials didn't want to open mass shelters and worsen the spread of COVID-19.
 But in Cameron Parish, where Laura came ashore, Nungesser said 50 to 150 people refused pleas to leave and planned to weather the storm in everything from elevated homes to recreational vehicles. The result could be deadly, since some houses weren't raised high enough to withstand the massive storm surge.
 "It's a very sad situation," said Ashley Buller, assistant director of emergency preparedness. "We did everything we could to encourage them to leave."
 Becky Clements, 56, didn't take chances; she evacuated from Lake Charles after hearing that it could take a direct hit. With memories of the destruction almost 15 years ago by Hurricane Rita, she and her family found an Airbnb hundreds of miles inland.
 "The devastation afterward in our town and that whole corner of the state was just awful," Clements recalled Wednesday. "Whole communities were washed away, never to exist again."
 Forecasters expected a weakened Laura to cause widespread flash flooding in states far from the coast. An unusual tropical storm warning was issued as far north as Little Rock, where forecasters expected gusts of 50 mph (80 kph) and a deluge of rain through Friday. After turning eastward and reaching the Atlantic Ocean, it could again become a tropical storm and threaten the Northeast.
 Laura hit the U.S. after killing nearly two dozen people on the island of Hispaniola, including 20 in Haiti and three in the Dominican Republic, where it knocked out power and caused intense flooding.
 Laura was the seventh named storm to strike the U.S. this year, setting a new record for U.S. landfalls by the end of August. The old record was six in 1886 and 1916, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.

ROCKFORD -- The latest exhibit at the Discovery Center Museum is an interactive lesson in science and engineering courtesy of Woodward Inc.
   
 The company partnered with the Discovery Center to open the Energy on the Move exhibit, which focuses on how energy is harnessed for uses on land, at sea and in the air. The exhibit incorporates Woodward's 150-year history and its contributions to the aerospace and other industries.
   
 The exhibit opened to the public on Wednesday.
   
 Tom Gendron, chairman and CEO of Woodward, said he hopes the exhibit will motivate children to take an early interest in science and engineering.
   
 "Especially during this very difficult year in our industry and around our world, we hope this exhibit brings visitors in the Rock River Valley a fun way to learn about possible STEM careers," Gendron said in a news release.
   
 Woodward, which was founded in Rockford in 1870 and now is headquartered in Fort Collins, Colorado, is one of the region's largest employers. The global pandemic has disrupted its business, forcing hundreds of layoffs earlier this year and the halt of a planned merger with Hexcel Corp.
   
 The company, which designs, manufactures and provides service for control system solutions and components for the aerospace and industrial markets, has been a longtime supporter of the Discovery Center. The latest exhibit is yet another example of how the company has supported the museum's mission to excite children about math and science, said Sarah Wolf, executive director of the Discovery Center.
   
 "Our goal is to inspire the creative thinkers of the future," Wolf said in a news release. "It's a goal we cannot achieve without the ongoing, invaluable support of partners like Woodward. It is these same creative thinkers that companies like Woodward seek and value for their organization."
   
 Discovery Center was closed from March 15 until July 8 because of the coronavirus pandemic and related restrictions on public gatherings. The museum now has several safety restrictions in place and requires reservations in advance of visiting.

Judge said that 90 percent of utility companies aren’t required to pay for reimbursements due to an “act of God,” such as a tropical storm, adding that Eversource is not required to pay for lost food or medication.
 Lawmakers questioned why a company that can afford to pay its executives tens of millions of dollars won’t take the initiative to reimburse customers who may have lost thousands of dollars’ worth of food and medicine.
 “My primary role is to serve shareholders, customers, and employees,” Judge said. “I feel it’s accomplished if you look at the quality of service we provide. … My primary job is to create a performance-driven culture at the company that moves the company forward.”
 Committee chairman Sen. Ned Needleman, D-Essex, disagrees with Judge’s representation of a company that has recently come under fire from lawmakers and customers.
 “I don’t think the ratepayers of Connecticut would agree you’re a top-tier company,” Needleman said. “If all your customers think you’re not doing a good job, I don’t care about the other metrics.”
 He suggested Eversource’s board of trustees include an advocate for ratepayers, which Judge dismissed.
 “I don’t think you’d find that on most corporate boards,” Judge said. “I think you’d find that unusual.”
 Needleman noted that most corporations are not public utilities funded by ratepayers.
 Craig Hallstrom, Eversource’s president of regional electric operations for Connecticut, said the company started preparing for Isaias a week before it hit, but had to make staffing decisions four or five days before it struck because “resources become scarce.”
 Rather than employing all the line crews needed, Eversource uses contractors that are hired when needed to complement employees.
 Needleman noted the line crew system is a way for Eversource to save money on contractors rather than having to pay pensions for more full-time Eversource employees.
 “It’s a financial decision, clearly a financial decision,” he said.
 To date, Eversource employs about 500 crews, the same as in 2012, Judge said, adding that paying a sufficient number of line crews without the threat of a storm would make it difficult to find enough work for them to do.
 Including contractors, Eversource ended up with more than 2,500 crews when responding to Isaias.
 “We were prepared,” Hallstrom said.
 Needleman, however, doubts the company’s system for line crews will be sufficient if the other two states it serves – Massachusetts and New Hampshire – are hit with a storm the same time as Connecticut.
 “There will be a storm that hits your entire service area,” he said, adding that there has been “a huge lapse in hiring.”
 Hallstrom said Eversource tries to “strike a balance” between the number of in-house employees and contractors, but “we’ll never be at a point where we’re going to have enough crews to handle an event like (Isaias), or even a bigger event, every day on our property. … Crews cost money.”

Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India] Aug 27 (ANI/Mediawire): Restaurant body, AHAR, pegs revenue losses to the tune of more than fifty per cent.   The current lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted all small and medium restaurants in the city. There are over 8000 eateries registered with the restaurateur's body AHAR and those bearing the maximum brunt are the ones who have to take care of their large workforce.   Furthermore, overheads and sustained skilled worker salaries add to the woes of the eatery owners in their fight for survival, said Geeta Hansaria.   Among those impacted is also one of the Mumbai's most renowned quick service restaurants - Achija established in 1987 in Ghatkopar, Pant-Nagar famous for its scrumptious Pav-Bhaji & Fast-Food.   "We are a chain of vegetarian restaurants and have been serving quality fast- food since 1987. There are always ups and downs in business but never in the last three decades have we seen such staggering disruption. The turmoil in the Food & Beverage sector is so severe that, it will easily take over a year for things to crawl back to normal," explained Tapan Mange, Restaurateur-Promoter, Achija.   Other restaurant owners have concerns similar to those expressed by Mange. Due to real estate being expensive in Mumbai, small eating joints have always had modest space to accommodate their customers. "We used to try and squeeze six people in a table that could comfortably accommodate four, during peak hours due to space crunch. Currently, due to social-distancing norms that the government has laid out for everyone's safety during the pandemic, we are not able to do this. Due to the lockdown, the footfalls have reduced drastically, however, the overheads, salaries, and maintenance costs still have to be borne by us. This impact may force us to hike our selling price," said the owner of Hotel Manohar, another long-standing eatery in Dadar.   AHAR, the unified body representing restaurateurs' quotes from a recent CRISIL report that the F&B industry in the country is worth 1.5 lakh crores and it will take another year for it to recover. Dine inns account for 75 per cent of the revenue while deliveries and takeaways account for the rest 25 per cent. The turnover of each restaurant has experienced an estimated revenue loss of 55 - 60 per cent in this period. Cities like Mumbai and Delhi, where the toll of the pandemic has been worse, in themselves account for half of the organized hotel industry, and the impact is seen there is maximum.   "Ours is a perishable goods industry. Our migrant manpower has left us, we still have overheads and rentals to tackle in spite of business being down to almost a trickle. Even in the near future people would prefer to call in food at home, as in most of our small restaurants due to crunched spaces, strict social distancing is difficult to follow and hence we have to rely only on take-outs & parcels. However, even today we are bound to pay our overheads at the commercial rate," said Niranjan Shetty, Member, AHAR. After the lockdown, the F&B Industry hopes the Maharashtra State Government will consider problems of the sector afresh.   "Such a terrible drop in business has deep-rooted repercussions & has disrupted the entire supply chain of the State - be it dairy, veggies, kirana or gas supply. Even the farmers have been severely affected, causing a serious economic worry. As the other States are working on creating employment opportunities for the labour that has returned to their hometowns, we will have to additionally brace ourselves for expensive labour in Mumbai," said Tapan.   "Maharashtra's Cabinet Minister for Tourism and Environment, Aditya Thackeray has always advocated restaurants being open around the clock and introducing legal & standardized food trucks with allotted legal spaces; a few things that are much awaited. We may need some Government aided relief to a few but not all sectors as it's Mumbai. This may be the correct time to experiment, implement, overhaul & rejuvenate the battered sectors with a facelift, better functionality, better capabilities & help bring our beloved city Mumbai back to it's prime & charm," concluded Tapan Mange, Entrepreneur/Restauranteur.

A temporada 4 de _Fortnite_ Capítulo 2 está no ar, e com ela um novo Passe de Batalha. Mais cedo, a Epic Games divulgou o trailer do Passe de Batalha da temporada.


  O vídeo mostra algumas das recompensas que ficarão disponíveis através do Passe de Batalha durante a temporada temática da Marvel.


  O trailer começa com um monólogo de Thor em que ele explica que, apesar de suas memórias estarem fragmentadas, ele sabe que trouxe esses "poderosos heróis" para defender sua realidade. Depois, o herói continua explicando a ameaça que é Galactus, “o devorador de mundos”.


  Thor apresenta os outros heróis que provavelmente estarão disponíveis para diferentes níveis do Passe de Batalha, começando por Tempestade, a heroína da Marvel que é mais conhecida pelos quadrinhos dos X-Men. Tempestade pode controlar o tempo e usá-lo contra seus inimigos.


  Depois vem Tony Stark, que aparece sem uniforme por um tempo antes de colocar sua armadura de Homem de Ferro e levantar voo.


  A Mística aparece usando seus poderes mutantes para transformar sua aparência na de uma das personagens de _Fortnite_.


  O primeiro vilão tradicional da Marvel que aparece no trailer é o Doutor Destino, que geralmente é associado ao _Quarteto Fantástico_ , sentado em um trono.


  Jennifer Walters aparece se transformando na Mulher-Hulk. Logo depois disso, Wolverine mostra as garras para a câmera. Por fim, o último herói que aparece no trailer é Groot, que mais tarde aparece com seu companheiro Rocket, dos _Guardiões da Galáxia_.


  Ao longo do trailer, são mostradas cenas de cada herói no jogo, usando seus poderes para eliminar inimigos em vez das armas que costumam ser encontradas no jogo.


  O trailer encerra com todos os heróis juntos. Thor encerra seu monólogo dizendo: “Junte-se a nós. Juntos, derrotaremos Galactus e salvaremos todas as realidades.”


  A temporada 4 de _Fortnite_ Capítulo 2 está no ar.

Title-holders Mamelodi Sundowns edged leaders Kaizer Chiefs 1-0 in Soweto Thursday to draw level on 53 points at the top of the South African Premiership table.
 Chiefs remain top on goal difference (plus 21/plus 16), but German coach Ernst Middendorp was dejected at full-time knowing his side once held a 10-point lead in the richest African league.
 The result sets up a tense climax to a season halted for five months from March due to the coronavirus pandemic with South Africa having the fifth most Covid-19 cases in the world.
 Chiefs face Bidvest Wits, Chippa United and Baroka in their run-in while Sundowns meet Baroka, Polokwane City and Black Leopards in a season that ends on September 5.
 Uruguayan Gaston Sirino scored the only goal on 34 minutes behind closed doors at Orlando Stadium in Soweto to throw the title chase wide open.
 He fired past Nigerian goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi for this third league goal of the season after being set up by a brilliant back-heel from Themba Zwane.
 Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane rejected the view of the South African media that the Soweto showdown was the title decider.
 "Chiefs are still top of the table and goal difference could decide which club becomes champions," he said.
 "People say that we should win our remaining three matches comfortably because they are against three of the last four clubs in the table.
 "These clubs are fighting for survival and will prove very tough opponents. I would rather face teams whose Premiership status is secure.
 \- 'Nerve racking' -
 "We knew Chiefs would be a threat in the air and from set pieces and dealt well with those situations.
 "It was nerve racking in the closing stages defending a one-goal lead, but that was our fault as we had sufficient chances to have scored at least twice more."
 Chiefs lacked their first-choice forwards with Serb Samir Nurkovic suspended and Colombian Leonardo Castro injured, and off-form Zimbabwean Khama Billiat was dropped.
 Middendorp gambled by picking rarely used Keletso Sifama as a wide midfielder and the move backfired with the ineffective teenager taken off at half-time.
 His place went to Billiat, who has scored only once in the Premiership this season and wasted a late chance to equalise when he headed over from close range.
 "We spent virtually the entire second half camped in Sundowns' half and did not take several great scoring chances," lamented Middendorp.
 "Now we must prepare for our next match against Wits, who are unbeaten in six games since the league restarted."
 Chiefs have won a record 53 domestic trophies, but their last success came five years ago when they were crowned champions.
 Meanwhile, fourth-place Wits and mid-table Bloemfontein Celtic preserved their unbeaten records since the restart by drawing 1-1 at the University of Pretoria.
 Both goals came from first half penalties with Keegan Ritchie giving Wits an early lead that Celtic captain Ndumiso Mabena cancelled.

New Delhi [India], Aug 27 (ANI): A day after she claimed that several Bollywood celebrities are into narcotics, actor Kangana Ranaut on Thursday motivated people to consume healthy and natural food items.   The 'Queen' actor took to Twitter to share a picture of herself holding a glass full of fresh sugarcane juice and said that while drugs bring people down, healthy and nutritious food items such as fruit juices take them up.   "Drugs might take you high for sometime but inevitably it throws you down into the depths of depression, consume things that only take you up never down, earth has so much to offer, look at this freshly squeezed chilled sugarcane juice with a pinch of pink salt and lemon juice," she tweeted.   The picture showed the 33-year-old actor seated in her car wearing a white coloured kurta and posing with the glass of sugarcane juice.   Kangana, who is vocal about her opinions on the Sushant Singh Rajput death case, on Wednesday made a remark on social media that "if Narcotics Control Bureau enters Bollywood (Bollywood), many A-listers will be behind bars."   The statements from the 'Queen' actor has come after a recent turn in the late actor's death case, where his girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty's WhatsApp chats have alleged a new drug angle. (ANI)

Long before we saw the 2021 Ford Bronco in the metal, the Blue Oval dropped the Bronco R. This beast is a race-prepped machine that tackled last year's Baja 1000. While it hinted at the new Bronco, it also celebrated a 1969 Bronco's overall race win decades ago. At the end of the day, the Bronco R made some noise, even though it wasn't victorious as Ford hoped it'd be. That's racing for you.


  But what do we have here? It appears Ford's totally open to possibly bringing the Bronco R goodness to others, as long as there's a demand for it. Speaking to Muscle Cars & Trucks, the automaker's chief product development officer, Hau Thai-Tang, told the website in a Wednesday interview if there's interest in a turn-key race truck like the Bronco R, the company will have a look. It sounds like this kind of program is nowhere near reality as things stand, though. Ford told Roadshow there are "no production plans for Bronco R," but the SUV will once again tackle the Baja 1000 this year.

Mark Sibley averaged 19.2 points as a senior at Northwestern in 1973. Skip Thoren (22.2 and 20.3 points at Illinois) and Danny Jones (20.4 at Wisconsin) are the only local basketball players to ever score higher than Sibley for a major college basketball team.
   
 Allen Rayhorn (19.9 points at NIU), Dan Godfread (19.9 at Evansville) and Chad Gallagher (19.4 points at Creighton) are the only other local players to average that much at any Division I school.
   
 And Sibley wasn't even supposed to be a scorer.
   
 "I was never a shooter. I couldn't hit the broad side of a barn in high school," Sibley said.
   
 Sibley, a 6-foot-1 ½ left-handed guard, was the glue guy for a Rockford West team that went 67-12 in his three seasons. He was the player who handled the ball, played good defense and helped make the other players on his team look good. But on Northwestern teams that finished last in the Big Ten all three years Sibley played, the No. 12 greatest basketball player in Rockford-area history had to take on a role he never planned to play.
   
 "I was being relied on to score," Sibley said. "I had never been a scorer in high school. I was a defensive and floor general type. I had to learn how to score in the Big Ten because that's what we needed.
   
 "Northwestern was not a high-flying circus offensively. Me scoring all those points, it's not averaging 30 or anything, but it's a good average. There weren't any Michael Jordans on the team to help pull the weight. Being the high scorer at Northwestern is not like being the high scorer at UCLA. I am not diminishing the accomplishment, just putting it in perspective."
   
 Sibley was a volume scorer his senior year, after being efficient his sophomore and junior seasons. He shot 46% and 45% those first two years when he averaged 13.7 and 14.1 points, but dipped to 39% as a senior. He finished seventh in the Big Ten in scoring, but was the only scorer in the top 18 to shoot below 44%. As a sophomore, he was 22nd in scoring but 12th among the top 25 in shooting percentage and eighth out of the top 20 as a junior when he was 19th in scoring.
   
 "I never did follow shooting percentage," Sibley said. "I had no knowledge of that whatsoever. I had long since realized we were not going to win any championships. I narrowed my goals to things that were manageable for me so I wouldn't atrophy through discouragement.
   
 "I loved the game and was so inspired to play well. Plus, I was in a fraternity with a bunch of guys who were outstanding football players. I wanted to perform for my buddies."
   
 But instead of being the guy who helped set up others to score, he now had to find ways to score himself. As the co-point guard with junior Kevin Kachan (both averaged 2.8 assists), he didn't have someone in charge of getting him the ball in his favorite places to score.
   
 "I never thought about that. Ever," Sibley said. "I got to live out my childhood dream of playing in the Big Ten. It never crossed my mind that there was another position to be in. I just liked my teammates and we worked as hard as we could and did the best we could.
   
 "I never thought about anybody else setting me up or me setting anyone else up. I was just running what coach wanted me to run."
   
 While Sibley's college teams finished last all three years, his high school teams won three consecutive conference titles, going 14-0 his sophomore and senior seasons and sharing the title in a four-way tie with Auburn, Guilford and Freeport at 10-4 as a junior in 1968.
   
 He was a rare sophomore on varsity in 1967 when West was 28-0 before losing 67-66 in overtime to Carbondale in the state semifinals. Sibley left that game in the middle of the third quarter with West leading by eight after getting kicked in the thigh. Without Sibley, the Warriors made several late turnovers.
   
 "If Sibley was in there, we would have beaten them by 10," said forward Jim Sallis, who scored 16 points in that loss. "We needed someone to handle the ball."
   
 A player known for his scoring in college was a player the West Warriors knew best as someone who did whatever the team needed, even if it couldn't be measured in the box score.
   
 "Mark Sibley was a good ballplayer," Sallis said. "We made him great. He had a good sense of the game. That's all we needed, a leader like that. He could go left and right. He had a good eye for finding people. And when he went to Northwestern, he just came out. He's one of the greatest players who ever came out of Rockford."
   
 Sibley says the same about 1967 West forwards Sallis and Cal Glover, who went on to become the all-time leading scorer (1,729 points) and No. 2 rebounder (1,209) at NCAA Division III Wisconsin-Stout.
   
 "I played all the way to the top and they are still the best ballplayers I ever played with. They are just giants in my mind," said Sibley, who played 28 games with the Portland Trail Blazers after being cut by the Chicago Bulls, who drafted him in the fourth round. He averaged 1.6 points. "It was all in garbage time," he said.
   
 Still, he treasures that NBA experience. As well as his time at Northwestern, where he met Pam, his wife of 42 years. Sibley, who taught English and coached basketball and soccer at York High School in Elmhurst for 32 years, said losing at Northwestern and learning he wasn't good enough for the NBA made him a better man.
   
 "It's called humility," he said. "I heard a sermon two years ago how Moses for the first 40 years in Pharaoh's palace thought he was something. Then he killed a guy and had to run and escape to the wilderness. For the next 40 years he found out he was nothing. His third 40 years, when he saw the burning bush and God sent him to Egypt, Moses found out what God could do with nothing. That's my life. It took my humbling in the NBA and my washouts in sports to learn that."

THUNDER BAY, Ont. - The federal government is under fire for what critics say has been a delayed response in getting back-to-school funding to First Nations amid the COVID-19 pandemic.


  On Wednesday, Ottawa announced $2 billion in back-to-school funding for provinces and territories, and another $112 million specifically for First Nations.


  The announcement came after Nishnawbe Aski Nation, which represents 49 Ontario First Nations, released a number of public statements accusing the government of dragging its feet on the issue.


  Last week, NAN said the government had rejected its request for $33 million in funding, designed to get its nearly 9,000 students back to school safely by providing them with adequate personal protective equipment and sanitization supplies.


  Deputy Grand Chief Derek Fox said Thursday the government is now asking NAN to resubmit its request — this time with a budget breakdown for each individual community, which he says will further slow an already protracted process.


  Fox said his opinion on Ottawa's efforts hasn't changed, noting how little $112 million is when divided amongst the country's roughly 630 First Nations.


  "That's not a lot of money considering (NAN) asked for $33 million, which would roughly be $3600 per kid," he said in an interview. "With this plan, we're looking at less than $100 per kid."


  Across NAN, Fox said schools are preparing to reopen even without the COVID- specific funding, and will instead be tapping into resources designed for the regular school year to purchase the supplies needed to make the learning environment safe.


  However, he noted that a number of schools are considering pushing the school year back to Oct. 28 — the beginning of the second "quadmester" — or potentially even 2021 if adequate funding can't be secured in time. Schools considering such action include Dennis Franklin Cromarty High School in Thunder Bay and Pelican Falls First Nations High School near Sioux Lookout, Fox said.


  Furthermore, Fox said 32 of NAN's 49 communities are remote and can be accessed only by plane. That presents unique challenges, he said, both in terms of getting kids to and from school, and preventing outbreaks that could be triggered by a child bringing the virus home from an urban centre.

"We called it a very good quarter, but it's tough to be ecstatic in an environment where you have a pandemic that affects an important segment of the population in a very negative way."


  Bank executives, including Vachon, said they on high alert for their fourth quarters because of the risk of a second wave of the virus, which could wipe away the economic gains of the past few months.


  "We are not out of this yet. We have the fall to get through," Royal Bank of Canada chief executive Dave McKay warned on Wednesday.


  If COVID-19 cases grow higher, it may erase some of the rehiring and consumer confidence Canada saw in its third quarter, forcing banks to dig deeper into their coffers to further help consumers and guard against the danger of loan defaults.


  "We're going to remain somewhat defensive and careful through still what I think will be a fairly challenging year," McKay said.


  The banks have already collectively dedicated $16.5 billion towards provisions for bad loans since COVID-19 spread widely in Canada in March.


  The bulk of those funds — $10.9 billion — were allocated in the second quarter, with this latest quarter seeing $5.6 billion added to the total.


  TD Bank Group set aside the most money — $2.19 billion — in the quarter, trailed closely by Bank of Nova Scotia with $2.18 billion.

Truckers in Chile on Thursday partially blocked major roads linking the north and south of the country in protest at an increase in attacks by militant indigenous people.
 Members of the Mapuche indigenous community have long-standing land disputes with the state, especially in the southern region of Araucania, around 600 kilometers south of the capital Santiago.
 Some have taken their frustrations to extreme levels, attacking trucks and forestry machinery.
 Several trucker unions called for the blockades, although sporadically some cars and trucks were allowed to pass.
 "We're asking for security, not just for truckers but all Chileans," Jose Villagran, president of the Southern Truckers Federation, told national television.
 He insisted that the blockade would not prevent deliveries of food and supplies.
 The truckers want the government to pass a law that treats the breaking and entering into a truck cab on the same level as burglary, as well as greater security on the roads.
 At the weekend, a nine-year-old girl was hurt after gunmen opened fire on a truck in Araucania.
 She was traveling with her family, which was forced to flee the vehicle before the attackers torched it, police said.
 Some people deny the Mapuche are behind the attacks and claim they are staged.
 Deputy Interior Minister Juan Francisco Galli said he shared "the security worry ... expressed by those working in cargo transport."
 However, he added that "a truck strike will do nothing to solve these problems. The solution will come from dialogue without threats, extortion or ultimatums."
