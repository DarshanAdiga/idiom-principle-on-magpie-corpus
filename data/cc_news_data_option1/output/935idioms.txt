China’s exports plummeted in the first two months of this year on the back of a coronavirus epidemic that forced businesses to suspend operations, disrupting the world’s supply chains. Exports fell 17.2 percent from a year ago, the biggest drop since February 2019 during the trade war with the United States, and imports dropped 4 percent, according to customs data released Saturday. A Bloomberg poll of economists had expected a smaller fall in exports, by 16.2 percent, but had forseen a much starker drop on imports of 16.1 percent. Coronavirus cases were first reported last December in Wuhan, in China’s central Hubei province, prompting a lockdown of the key industrial region with some 56 million people, from late January. Measures to contain the outbreak that has killed over 3,000 in the country, including travel curbs and quarantines, have hit the workforce and supply chains. China’s trade surplus with the US — a key point of contention in the trade dispute between the two countries — sharply narrowed 40 percent in the first two months, from $42 billion last year to $25.4 billion. It is the first time Chinese authorities have published combined trade data for January and February. This is in line with how some other indicators are released to smooth over distortions from the holiday break, but the situation this year is unusual with the epidemic. Much deeper impact - Capital Economics’ Julian Evans-Pritchard said in a report Friday that combining the data in January and February means the “published growth rate won’t fully reflect the extent of the recent weakness”. This is because disruptions were mostly concentrated in February. He added that the recent downturn in trade has been “much deeper” than the data is likely to suggest. Moody’s Analytics economist Xu Xiaochun told AFP on Saturday that the slowdown is likely to continue into parts of March. “High frequency data such as coal and energy consumption, as well as metro usage, suggest that workers are still slowly returning to work,” he said. Outbreaks beyond China, such as in South Korea and Europe, will further harm Chinese exports since external demand will be lower, Xu said. In another early sign of the economic impact to come, China’s manufacturing activity fell to its lowest level on record in February, and non-manufacturing activity plummeted too. With the coronavirus spreading around the world, it is not just China’s slowdown that weighs on global growth, which could contract in the first quarter. “What began as a supply shock in China has morphed into something much more serious,” Oxford Economics said in a report.—APP

“It was my turn to give back,” VanMersbergen said.
 The photographer is among many in the community who heard about the bullying A’Myah suffered. She has something in common with the child.
 VanMersbergen explained, "I am actually a cancer survivor.”
 Like A’Myah, the photographer also knows the feeling of losing hair from chemo treatments.
 VanMersbergen said, "When I read that her wig was snatched off her head, I can only imagine what she went through in that exact moment.”
 People across social media responded to stories about A’Myah and wanted to do something. VanMersbergen called up her friend and makeup artist Yana Kolmakova. They set up a photo session for A’Myah’s family, hoping it would ease their worries and boost the girl’s confidence.
 VanMersbergen explained, "Right before I did the shot, I went up to them and I said, ‘This is about your fight! This is about you women being warriors!'"
 Since A’Myah’s family began speaking out, people from across the country have become warriors for A’Myah and supporting the family’s fight against bullying. Supporters include the Mayor of Plano, members of Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, local churches, police, radio hosts, Good Samaritans, and athletes like Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers.

The start of Jesse's rookie Xfinity season has already been filled with many first time and exciting experiences both on and off the track. With a new year comes a new team - JD Motorsports with Gary Keller - and new sponsors for the team including Series Seating and Kabat, Schertzer, De LaTorre, Taraboulos & Company (KSDT CPA), and returning as partners with Jeses Little Racing Skuttle Tight and Dkota Investments. In addition to all of the firsts of the season, Jesse's season started strong as he pulled double duty during the season openers at the historic Daytona International Speedway in both the Xfinity and Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series'. Restrictor plate racing is infamous for the drivers having to avoid the inevitable wrecks, and Jesse stayed out of trouble until the last few laps during each of the races. Jesse and the JD Motorsports with Gary Keller team brought home a 19th place finish during the NASCAR Racing Experience 300, and with the Teletrac Navman Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series Silverado Jesse and the Diversified Motorsports team finished 24th in the NexEnergy250. Week 2 of the Xfinity season brought us to our first stop on the West Coast tour with a stop in Sin City. The desert provided unusual weather with several rain delays and attempts at starting the Boyd Gaming 300 before the race was postponed to Sunday following the Cup race. Jesse had another great race and brought home a 14th place finish. During the second leg of the West Coast tour the Xfinity series visited the beautiful Auto Club Speedway in Fontana CA. Before Jesse made any laps around the track there was some off track activities that he was looking forward to. Thursday afternoon Jesse visited with the patients and staff at Shriners for Children Medical Center where he toured the facilities, signed autographs and spent time with Shriner Patient ambassador Sebastian Perez. Sebastian and his family also joined Jesse and his JD Motorsports team at honorary crew members and guests for the race weekend. Friday evening after practice Jesse and teammates also visited 4th and Mill in Ontario, CA. where they had the opportunity to sign autographs for guests. Saturday Jesse and the JD Motorsports team got back to work and rolled off the grid with a solid 16th position for the Production Alliance Group 300 at Auto Club Speedway. Again, Jesse was able to avoid the on track incidents and finished 28th. Looking forward to Phoenix, Jesse is excited to again provide the opportunity for another Shriners Ambassador and patient Kaitlyn Leingangt and family to visit with Jesse and join the team as honorary crew members. Keep watching for these special moments through the remainder of the season as Jesse partners with Shriners for more experiences with additional Ambassador patients. Jesse Little PR
