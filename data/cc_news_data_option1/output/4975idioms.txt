In January I compiled a list of goals for the year ahead. Clearly travelling around Asia and networking more at press events didn’t happen. But as I glance over the list, I start to realise maybe 2020 wasn’t a total write-off.
 I have learned to cook some of my favourite dishes, making roti with my partner and brewing my own Pho (for two hours, no less). For the first time in years, I’ve also managed to tick off “read more”, making a small dent in the unread pile on my bookshelf. And, having said goodbye to my commute, I have indeed slowed down and finally bidden good riddance to my insomnia.
 It’s been an exceptionally challenging year for businesses and those that lead them, a year of suffering and anxiety for many - and many have struggled. But has there been a silver lining? We ask our C-suite panel for the upsides of 2020.

(AP) – Without any in-school special education services for months, 14-year-old Joshua Nazzaro’s normally sweet demeanor has sometimes given way to aggressive meltdowns that had been under control before the pandemic.The teenager, who has autism and is nonverbal, often wanted no part of his online group speech therapy sessions, and when he did participate, he needed constant hands-on guidance from aides hired by his family. He briefly returned to his private Denville, New Jersey, school for two days a week, but surging coronavirus infections quickly pushed learning back online through at least Dec. 10.Some of Josh’s progress “has been undone, and there are no plans to make it up,” said Sharon MacGregor, who has been involved in the boy’s care since she began dating his father several years ago.Paraprofessional Jessica Wein helps Josh Nazzaro stay focused while attending class virtually from his home in Wharton, N.J., Wednesday, Nov. 18, 2020.The same frustrations are shared by many of the nation’s 7 million students with disabilities — a group representing 14% of American schoolchildren. Advocates for these students say the extended months of learning from home and erratic attempts to reopen schools are deepening a crisis that began with the switch to distance learning in March.Some schools have prioritized high-needs students in reopening plans, bringing small numbers of them back to campuses that otherwise are sticking with distance learning. But those options have only fueled further anguish when they have been reversed because of the virus, and educators say personalized video sessions remain poor substitutes for classroom experience.Alarmed by their children’s setbacks in skills and behaviors, parents are pursuing legal challenges and requesting makeup services. Many worry that the ground lost will be impossible to recover.“Regression is something that will be very, very hard to recuperate from,” said Robin Lake, director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education.In a move that seemed to acknowledge the importance of in-person learning, New York City announced Sunday that it will reopen the nation’s largest school system to in-person learning, including programs serving special-needs students at all grade levels. The announcement marked a major reversal after New York schools were shut down because of rising COVID-19 cases.School districts have also struggled to deliver guaranteed services such as physical therapy that must be done in person or that require equipment, according to a recent report from the Government Accountability Office.To his family’s relief, sixth-grader Griffin Stinner returned to school four days a week in mid-October when special education students were among the first to return to the Kenmore Town of Tonawanda Union Free School District in western New York state. But it did not last. Shortly before Thanksgiving, the district announced it would revert to fully remote learning because of the region’s rising virus caseload.Griffin’s mother, Dawn, a teacher who is leading her preschool class of 4- and 5-year-olds remotely, called the situation “frustrating beyond belief.” After the initial shutdown in the spring, Griffin, who is nonverbal and has autism, would put on his shoes after breakfast to await the bus and cry over the loss of routine.His mother would stand next to him and sign him in and out of lessons on a computer multiple times a day. “It was just really hard for him to grasp the concept that this was school,” she said.Having to pivot again is “going to be a huge disruption in his life,” she said.The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act guarantees a free public education to children with disabilities and allows for “compensatory” services if a state education agency, in response to a complaint, determines that more needs to be done. Now parents are starting to make requests.“It is becoming a major issue for our local directors,” said Phyllis Wolfram, executive director of the Council of Administrators of Special Education, or CASE.To make up every hour lost — on top of providing services going forward — would be impossible. Educators will need to make individual decisions based on where a student is today, compared with their status before services stopped or changed, she said.Speech pathologist Tara Kirkpatrick said the video sessions she conducts from her Comal, Texas, school office bear little resemblance to speech therapy delivered face to face. On video, she cannot tap a student’s desk to get them back on track.Still, she believes teachers and families are doing their best under the circumstances.“It’s not ideal ... and there’s nothing that we can do about that right now,” she said.Not everyone agrees. A federal class-action lawsuit that named every state education department in the country sought a court order to either immediately reopen schools for students with special needs or issue vouchers for parents who have had to leave jobs or hire outside help to fill in the gaps.A judge in New York City dismissed the suit, ruling that the court lacked jurisdiction, but not before more than 500 families in 35 states had moved to sign on.“It’s a horror what’s going on,” said attorney Patrick Donohue, who filed the complaint and plans to appeal its dismissal. “We have kids who were walking, now aren’t walking. Kids who were talking, now aren’t talking. Kids who didn’t have any potty-training issues, now they’re not potty-trained.”Older students aging out of services will not have time to recover, Donohue said. Federal law entitles students with disabilities educational services up to the age of 21.Educators, Wolfram said, share parents’ concerns about students falling behind, but they are “at the mercy of the pandemic” and the rules adopted by governors and health departments.Even fully reopening schools will not be enough, she said.“It’s going to depend a lot on the resources that are available,” she said, citing potential help from local, state and federal governments. “And do we have the staff to do it? There are a lot of obstacles.”Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

London [UK], December 4 (ANI): Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said fans made a huge contribution to their victory over Rapid Vienna as the Emirates Stadium welcomed supporters into the stands for the first time in nine months.   Arsenal defeated Rapid Vienna 4-1 in the Europa League clash in the presence of 2,000 fans. Earlier, the matches were being played behind closed doors due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.   "[It was] very special and I am delighted to have them back. I think they made a huge contribution," the club's official website quoted Arteta as saying.  
 The manager also said that they had 2,000 fans "but it looked like many more" as he thanked them for being "very encouraging".      "We had 2,000 but it looked like many more. They were very supportive of the team, very encouraging and the lads were saying it makes a huge difference to feel that support and energy. Thank you so much to them for coming and supporting the team," he said.   "It made a huge difference, honestly, even if it was only 2,000. Those 2,000 were really positive towards the team and that energy in some really difficult moments is even more appreciated. I appreciate the supporters a lot," Arteta added.   The victory means that Arsenal now have won all their five Europa League matches that they have played so far in the season. The club will now take on Tottenham in the Premier League on Sunday.

SPRINGFIELD, MA (WGGB/WSHM) -- Restaurants are doing what they can to stay open during the pandemic. But with COVID-19 restrictions in place and colder weather ending the outdoor option, the bottom line is taking another hit.
 That's why an organized effort is about to get started in Springfield to attract extra business. Springfield Restaurant Week was postponed in April, but from December 4-13, the public is encouraged to dine-in, take out, or get a gift card from a restaurant in the city to help owners stay in business.
 “Not only are you supporting my dream, but you’re helping me as far as supporting the whole business itself," explained the owner of 413 Café, Christina Raschi. "Employment, inventory costs, food costs, coffee costs, expanding the menu.”

To help close that gap, Fraser said the plan is to leave six open city positions open, freeing up $384,000. He said the positions won’t be cut and the hope is to fill them once the financial issues caused by the pandemic are over.
 Capital and equipment spending has been reduced $538,170 and the amount of external and community funding from the city has been reduced $412,650. Fraser’s budget also calls for a $68,300 reduction in operations funding. The current budget has $47,000 in funding for ballot items for the Central Vermont Public Safety Authority and Central Vermont Home Health & Hospice. Without those items for the proposed budget, that $47,000 can be saved.
 The total for reductions is $1,450,120.
 Fraser said his budget has no tax increase and keeps funding for Montpelier Alive, a social worker for the police department, an equity consultant and basic services are maintained.
 While Mayor Anne Watson cautioned things might get worse this winter before they get better, she said she was also hopeful with news of a vaccine on its way.
 “It feels like there is light at the end of the tunnel,” she said.
 The City Council will discuss the budget in detail at a workshop Dec. 9. Another such workshop will be held Jan. 6 followed by public hearings on Jan. 13 and Jan. 21. Residents will vote on the budget on Town Meeting Day March 2.

These days, Suniel Shetty is binge watching Rust Valley Restorers, admittedly enamoured by the Netflix offering. Soon, he will be on the other side of the table the actor is poised to foray into digital entertainment, and has greenlit two projects. Buzz in the trade indicates that the two series, in keeping with Shetty s macho image, will be stylised actioners. He will headline a cop underworld saga that is high on stunts the other show is a thriller drama. The projects, apparently lined up for Disney Hotstar and Netflix, are expected to go on floors soon, says a trade source. On his part, the actor says that he has long been toying with the idea of exploring digital entertainment. In the past, I was offered many web series that I turned down. But now, I have given my nod to two shows. Both are backed by top production houses, and I am waiting for them to make the announcement. If Abhishek Bachchan, Saif Ali Khan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui have made their presence felt in the OTT world, Akshay Kumar and Hrithik Roshan are set to take the plunge. Ask him why he waited so long to test the waters, and Shetty says, I wanted to make sure that the platforms are right. I was clear that I want to play the lead, and the script has to be powerful. I enjoy the genre of action stories of armed forces and underworld appeal to me. In fact, I have noticed that dark content works on the web.
