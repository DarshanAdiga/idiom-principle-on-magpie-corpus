RISING SUN — Supporters of the Greater Maryland Chapter of the Alzheimer’s Association will be walking all over Cecil County Oct. 3 for the Harford-Cecil County Walk to End Alzheimer’s.
 One of those walks will be at Calvert Regional Park where Sundina Jones and her family will be walking in memory of her father John Neff.
 “My father was diagnosed in 2014,” Jones said. Because Neff was living in another state Jones said she was not aware of the diagnosis until 2017.
 “I would notice he’d forget someone’s name but it happened so infrequently you’d brush it off,” she said, looking back at the disease’s progression. “In 2017 my step-mom called and said, “We need to talk.”
 After getting the news Jones said she did what she always does.
 “I’m a researcher. I’m a fixer. I started looking for natural remedies,” she said.
 Considered a degenerative brain disease, Alzheimer’s robs a person of memory. There is no known cause; nor is there any cure. For now there are drugs that can only slow its progression in some patients.
 According to Nicole Gorski, coordinator for Harford and Cecil counties, there are an estimated 110,000 Maryland residents living with the disease. Add to that their family, friends and caregivers to see how Alzheimer’s affects more than just the patient. That’s become even more evident with the pandemic.
 “The impact of isolation has just increased,” Gorski said. “It puts such stress on the caregivers.”
 Even before COVID-19 Jones was feeling that stress, compounded by the fact her father was in another state. Regular phone calls and virtual chats became weekly trips. For Jones the Alzheimer’s Association was an unlimited source of support and information.
 “I would call and they would talk to me about this new medicine,” she said as an example, adding there was always someone answering the phone whenever she would call. “The people on that hotline are phenomenal.”
 She now advocates for the organization and promotes its resources and services.
 “We found the walk in 2019 and did it as a family. We want to give back,” Jones said. Of course last year the walk could be done en masse at Ripken Stadium in Aberdeen. This year, like just about everything else, the Walk to End Alzheimers has been happening virtually with participants walking in smaller groups close to home.
 While the official date for the walk is Oct. 3 Gorski said participants can walk anytime with the deadline of Dec. 31 to send in the money raised.
 “This really is a year-round fundraiser,” Gorski said. “But we would like as many people as possible to walk Oct. 3.”
 Register to walk at alz.org. On the events page there is a list of walk sites to join, or do your own walk. Gorski suggests downloading the Walk to End Alzheimer’s step tracking app.
 Keeping social distancing guidelines in mind, Jones said people are welcome to join her walk at Calvert Regional Park on Oct. 3.
 Look for the purple flags in the park marking the start and end points on the track around the park off Telegraph Road near Rising Sun.
 Jones had a goal of raising $1,000 for the Alzheimer’s Association.
 “I’ve raised $2,000 so far,” she said, adding that doesn’t mean she has stopped.
 “Just because COVID is here ... we can’t take a break,” Jones said. “We’ve got to keep going.”

Powerful eastern tribes loyal to Hifter first seized control of the oil fields in January, cutting Libya's production to a trickle and starving the country of badly needed cash, to protest what they describe as the unfair distribution of oil wealth and the diversion of revenue to Turkish-backed mercenaries fighting on behalf of the Tripoli-based government, which oversees Libya's Central Bank.

Interesting enough, I grew up in it. My mother has worked in the public relations field for major American television networks since I was eight. My career actually began as a child actress doing commercials and tv shows. As I grew older, I became fascinated with the behind-the-scenes of the industry and thus began my career as publicist working on projects like the MTV Video Music Awards at the age of 19. From there I met Alexis Borges, President of NEXT Models (LA) and one of my greatest mentors. That's where I pivoted my career from traditional PR to the world of fashion and talent management. The rest is history.

Jimi Hendrix only released four official albums during his lifetime, but the Hendrix vault from the last half-century of albums, books and films could fill a library. Here’s a breakdown of a few essential titles to read, watch and hear to get to know the Seattle superstar and international rock icon.
 And for Seattle-based readers: Paul Allen initially wanted to name his museum at Seattle Center “The Jimi Hendrix Museum,” and MoPOP, as it is called now, is an excellent source for anything Hendrix. Its gift shop carries many of the items listed above, or call Easy Street Records, or any of the independent record shops and bookstores in Seattle, and they will track down anything on this list for you.

I'm truly mystified at the lack of truthful information out there about the influencer industry. There's a lot of noise, or what I like to call "glitter", out there, but where's the proverbial gold? Does it even exist? Although I can't answer that question, I do know that The Influencer Masterclass is the first of its kind. We've never seen someone with 17+ years of talent management and public relations experience actually sitting down and explaining how the influencer industry really works. No smoke and mirrors. No sugar-coating. The Influencer Masterclass is pure radical transparency.

Electrifying our intercity passenger and freight railroads is another must. Where the electricity comes from matters — the current “upstream” power sources (including for electric cars) are too often carbon emitters. This is a reason I support nuclear power, as well as solar and wind.
 Further public investment is needed in research for clean power. We’re not quitting fossil fuels anytime soon — for one thing, they are important components in making many renewable-energy systems.
 We need to rethink the 10,000-mile supply chain. Carbon taxes and regulation of such things as dirty bunker fuel on ships would help (a switch to a lower- sulfur blend is already looking promising). But incentives for more local sources of goods and food are important, too.
 Mustering the political will to accomplish these goals and restoring American leadership on climate — including returning to the Paris Accords — is on the ballot this November.
 One candidate believes in climate change and has constructive plans. The other doesn’t.

Biden’s campaign team has come under scrutiny in recent days over its outreach efforts, particularly for what some see as short shrift with Latino voters. At the same time, Democrats have mixed views over the party’s get-out-the-vote effort that largely bypasses traditional door-knocking to avoid health risks during the pandemic, instead relying on virtual outreach.

Anyway, back in the real world, a recent British government backed study has revealed that a modern weekly shopping basket has changed considerably over the past five years. Tragically, something called ‘meat based snacks’ are in decline, which is a pity, because within this sub-section of grub lies such wonderful things such as - pork pies, sausage rolls, Cornish pasties and scotch eggs…of which I have a long term addiction. Happily, not all meat based snacks are on their way out. Quiche Lorraine, the epitome of food sophistication in the 1970’s is now seeing a revival along with mashed potato ready meals and Black Tower wine (I may have made that last one up!). You may have noticed, but it appears that there are no sudden surges in the area of supposed ‘must haves’ such as quinoa, goats cheese, walnut pesto, or any of that other criminally expensive ‘la-di-da’ bits of food that we are told are a modern day must? However, across the board, the biggest jump in consumer consumption has been in ‘athleisure’ wear. I know, don’t laugh. If the British nation as a whole is getting ever bigger, why then the sudden upsurge in the popularity of leggings and crop-tops - are all these folk flocking to the gym or yoga classes to get fit or slim down? Nah, don’t be daft, it’s all about looking like you might go to the gym occasionally, rather than actually doing it - it’s appearing to be fit without making the effort. Just like wearing a white coat doesn’t make you a doctor, or yelling at people in a pub on a Saturday night doesn’t make you a singer I suppose. Anyway, enough of all that, I’ve just been told that I’m having cauliflower cheese for lunch and all I can think of is - why would anyone want to eat that combination? Best not say anything though - you know, discretion being the better part of valour and all that. And yes, believe it or not, cauliflower - a foodstuff hated by school children for generations, is now about as ‘cool’ as any revolting foodstuff can be I’m told. Not for long though, I bet!
