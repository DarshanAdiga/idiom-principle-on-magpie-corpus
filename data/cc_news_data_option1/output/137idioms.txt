Bryant seems to be able to open any door in York. Hanging on to his coattails, I can go behind the scenes of what feels like every other building in the city centre. As the light fades, he shows me Herbert House, which is the sagging half-timbered house, four storeys high, that currently hosts the York Gin Shop on its ground floor. Upstairs, the house is badly in need of renovation. Bryant hopes to get support from the National Lottery Heritage Fund, thus breaking the trust’s decades-long record of self-sufficiency. “We must get public access into that building because it’s such an important part of the merchant area of York, and it has such a fascinating story to tell.”

It is time the Nigerian military began to take a deep and frank look at their sullied image, methods, processes and vision. Just how professional do they want to be? What image do they want to project to the world -- a fighting force that is so disciplined that it cannot be bought and would not be sold, or a fighting force where anything goes? Are they honest with themselves on what they have become, and are they pleased with the roles they are playing and how they are playing those roles? The Nigerian military needs a lot of introspection. Yes, they are not isolated from the rest of the society, a society that is sadly on a continuous decline in principles and character. That is true, for the legislature, executive and the judiciary are singly or sometimes collectively locked in unremitting moral decline, on such a scale that many have started to fear that the country might be headed for implosion.

The Mavs started the season 6-0 to jump to the program’s highest ranking. And for the first time, the Mavs were going to the NCAA tournament. It only took a shootout win over Denver — an 11-rounder that UNO won 9-8 — in the Summit final to earn the bid. Eleven Mavs were named to the all-conference teams that season. Again: This was a program that didn’t even exist at the beginning of the 2010s. This breakthrough wasn’t just about the players on the team, either. Though the Mavs lost their first NCAA tournament game, it was a feel- good story for the program built with a mix of local players and others who didn’t get a shot at major-conference schools. (How can you pick one player from this group for the all-decade team?)

Murphy, 50, of Danvers, Massachusetts, worked until July as a clubhouse attendant for the Boston Red Sox, which has suspended him without pay. His attorney has said he doesn't know the victim and denies all the charges.
 Meehan said he landed in the detention center after running away from a physically abusive home and joining what he described as a biker gang of thieves. After one arrest, he said he was being transported back to a pre- trial holding facility when another teen already at the center told him about being raped and beaten. Meehan said they persuaded the sheriff's deputy to stop for a bathroom break and then fled, still wearing their handcuffs. They were on the run for two weeks before being caught.
 “This was an older brother, looking out for me,” he said. “He was telling me that he wasn't going to allow me to walk into that.”
 Since his release, Meehan has married and raised three children, and for years owned a roofing and residential construction company. But he’s also been arrested for drunken driving and for burglaries, which he says he committed to pay for what at times was a $500-per-day heroin habit. The drinking and drugs allowed him to avoid thinking about his past, he said. His wife, Erin Meehan, whom he began dating as a teenager, said she knew nothing of the abuse until 2017, when he told her, “They raped me.”
 In a lengthy interview that included some tears, David Meehan said he is determined to stand up for other victims.
 “It’s about holding people accountable for their own actions," he said. "I personally have to face judgment for things I’ve done wrong, which seem petty compared to what these guys did. Why should any of us survivors carry the burden of their dirty secret anymore?”

Jam session is an opinion forum offering comments on issues from a group of Plymouth residents. It appears on the Forum pages in the Weekend edition of the OCM.
 The newspaper poses a question to the group each week, and participants choose whether to comment. This column is designed to bring the voices of well- informed residents into the Forum page to address issues, one at a time.
 Participants cross the local political spectrum and live throughout the town. Some are current or past Town Meeting representatives, and all are active in the community. We hope their diverse points of view will encourage discussion of the issues Plymouth faces.
 This week's question  
 2020 has arrived, signaling the coming events of the 400th anniversary commemoration of the Pilgrims' arrival in 1620. How well will the year's festivities be received by local residents? Will this commemoration bring the community together?
 Pat Adelmann
 I look forward to the events celebrating the 400 years since the Pilgrims arrived and the lives of the Natives and the relationship with the newcomers. The Mayflower will be a happy sight back on the waterfront and the regatta of wooden ships welcoming her back on June 27 and 28.
 On Aug. 1, the Wampanoag Ancestors Walk will be an intriguing way to learn and appreciate the Wampanoag story.
 It will be exciting to see what the local schools and our talented students will contribute to the celebration. There are so many more events.
 It is a great time for our community to take pride and show off Plymouth and her people.
 Pat Adelmann has been a Plymouth resident since 1977 and is a mother of five Plymouth Public School graduates, a proud grandmother of 12, a former School Committee member and a former Town Meeting representative.
 Ed Angley
 What an exciting time! Other than the usual carping about traffic it should be exciting. I have no idea whether it will bring the community together given that we are 60-70,000 people spread over 100 sq. miles. I just offer the wish that we all act as ambassadors of the town and cheerfully offer help to tourists and answer questions they may have. Even if you do not speak another language, many foreigners speak some English. Just remember to speak slowly. From the many foreign language speakers we have hosted over the years, the biggest complaint is how fast we speak. Slow down, you move too fast, have to make the morning last.

 Jay Beauregard
 It will be received fine; only the traffic will be worse. There are a few things I would like to see and learn more about, which primarily is the Wampanoag history. I just don't like that the opening ceremony takes place at the American Ancestors headquarters in Boston.
 Will it bring the community together? Perhaps somewhat, more so for the groups that are pulling this together. But overall, I think it'll be just more tourists coming to the town. The restaurants and tourist traps will do very well as I hope they do.
 We've spent many millions of taxpayer's dollars to make the appearance of the town more attractive. I'm not sure how we could possibly recoup these monies, but… oh well.

 Jeff Berger
 I do PR for a living and have seen a remarkable lack of community PR about this project over the last few years. It is supposed to be an international celebration but it has been headed by locals when it should have been spearheaded by experts in similar major transcendental celebrations. Will it succeed in putting Plymouth on the map impactfully worldwide and growing our impact in destination tourism? I've made suggestions over the years about that here, including a $1-million (insured) reward for locating the original Mayflower Compact and transforming Plymouth into the most energy efficient community on the planet for 2020, both ignored. I do hope it's very busy for the sake of the town I've lived in for 40+ years, but I doubt that will happen. It could very well be greeted locally with shrugged shoulders. I do hope I'm wrong.

 Karen Buechs
 I'm sure people will enjoy the celebrations once festivities begin. To say the least, much planning made this possible. You ask, will it bring the community together? I believe so. Pride always brings people together. Pride in our hometown will be at the forefront.
 I envision it will be the 4th of July and Thanksgiving Day Parade all rolled into one. Tall ships. Celebrities. Perhaps even a royal or two. The president? Sure! Everyone is welcome to attend Plymouth's home town celebrations. Where it all began.

 Mike Landers
 I hope that the commemoration, events and festivities will be well received and embraced by everyone.
 I think that the 400th committee has carefully planned to not exclude anyone. That alone should help to bring the community together.
 My organization, Project Arts of Plymouth, will celebrate our 25th anniversary this year and we are ramping up our roster this year to celebrate our small portion of the commemoration. We are extremely happy to partner with the town and Plymouth 400 to help make 2020 a year that will long be remembered.

 David Peck
 The glib answer would be we will know by the end of the year. I expect a mixed reception by local residents. On one hand, we will be proud of Plymouth and happy to show it off to the expected wave of visitors, and happy for the hoped-for economic boost to the town. However, our town center might be overwhelmed by the crowds, by traffic, with scarce parking and long lines at downtown restaurants and activities. Some of our citizens might choose to get out of town during the time of planned signature events, as it was for Bostonians during the Democratic Convention years ago. One way the community will come together is that we can all learn more about the other half of our history, that of the Wampanoag civilization. To this end, I highly recommend a new book, "This Land is Their Land," by David Silverman. We should remember, and celebrate, that our Town's history includes both the Pilgrims and the Wampanoags. Please join me in the "Welcome to and Enjoy our Wonderful Town" camp, and hope the year lives up to expectations.

 Ed Russell
 In 2020, Plymouth will host wonderful events with great appeal to most local residents. I only wish more people in town were engaged with such activities . . . I'm thinking of those who claim never to go downtown to any events. I have every confidence in Plymouth 400's ability to create a big splash. There will be big celebrations when the Mayflower returns in May. Next year will bring the community together in many ways but I'm sure some of 2019's divisive issues that will carry forward; nationally, the president will continue to stir the pot and locally we can't eliminate our perennial whiners. Get out and celebrate - don't let anyone dampen your fun in 2020.

 James Blanchfield’s ball over the top was latched onto by Kreshnic Krasniqi, who was beaten by it the onrushing Ryan Clarke who punched to safety before colliding with the Kosovan midfielder. ____
 Referee Tom Reeves stunned everyone in Thames Road by pointing to the spot, but Clarke delivered justice, flicking Nouble’s penalty onto the post with an outstretched leg, Lamar Reynolds blasting the rebound off target. ____
 Krasniqi wastefully nodded Blanchfield’s excellent cross wide as City started on the backfoot, but they reacted well when Sam Pearson’s curling effort flew just over the bar, all this inside the opening 10 minutes. ____
 Both teams settled afterwards with the pitch proving difficult, passes often going astray on a dry, bobbly surface. ____
 City created two chances either side of the half hour mark. Smith fed Pearson through who stayed onside but goalkeeper Chris Haigh advanced well off his line to parry behind with his legs.

This modification of the lunge is ideal for those looking for a challenge. First, you start by doing a standard lunge – stepping forward and bending low until both knees are at a 90 degree angle. As you are facing forwards, this is your ‘12 o’clock’ position. Next, you step out your leg to the side as you lunge – putting you in a ‘3 o’clock position’. Continue round the clock face; Laidler recommends a 10-point lunge challenge.

 "It's been a non-stop blessing," Mila Brown said. "I know it's because of the program and me living right. This is the first time in my life I've had a living wage job. I've never really been comfortable in church, and they welcomed me (at Heaven's View Christian Fellowship) with open arms. And that's where we met and were married last April 13."
 The volunteer-driven Jobs Partnership Re-Entry program is a not-for-profit organization partnered with the Heaven's View Christian Fellowship church and housed in the former St. Cecilia grade school on West Richmond Avenue.
 It provides qualified offenders a variety of life skill classes to help enable them to successfully re-enter the community, land consistent employment and not return to jail.
 In the two years since the re-entry initiative has been added to the Jobs Partnership program in Peoria, there has been a 19% reduction in the tendency of a prisoner to offend again. Although the Peoria Jobs Partnership staff oversees programs around the state, only the program at the Peoria County Jail offers the re-entry element. The primary program is for male inmates, but there is also one for the much smaller number of incarcerated females.
 "We know this program is working because it's God's program," said program executive director Cheryl Parks. "When you change your heart, things will be better for you. The re-entry is a more holistic approach than our original program (established in 2000 and evolved steadily over the years). If we find out there's a need, we'll add that to the program. The Browns are great examples for us. They're all about helping and protecting the program."
 For the Browns, after a lifetime of difficulties and bad decisions, it's all turned around in the past two years.
 Tyrone Brown, 54, grew up in Chicago and moved to Peoria after a two-year stint in the Army. Soon after arriving here, he got involved in drugs and became a heroin addict. He was in and out of prisons and jails for years.
 "The last time I was in the Peoria County Jail, I made up my mind this would be the last time I would be incarcerated," he said. "I was sick and tired of being sick and tired of battling addiction and not reaching my potential as a man. I wanted to change my way of thinking, and Jobs Partnership became the perfect avenue to do that. I was grateful that it was a spiritual program because that put everything together for me."
 One month after leaving jail as a JPRE graduate in May 2018, Brown earned and has maintained a position as a machine operator at G&D.
 Mila Brown, 44, spent her formative years in Springfield and got involved with the wrong crowd.
 "I was in really bad, toxic relationships that beat me down," she said. "I ended up peddling drugs, prostituting, a little bit of everything to make it in the streets."
 Over the years, she was imprisoned three times. Like her future husband, she finally decided she'd had enough of the nowhere lifestyle.
 While doing time at the Logan Correctional Center in Lincoln, Mila Brown discovered Jobs Partnership. She connected with the program but didn't want to return to Springfield once her incarceration stint had been served.
 So she moved into the Peoria Jobs Partnership transitional home for female ex- offenders in August 2018. Within a month, she had landed a clerical job at G&D.
 "I didn't even know how to turn a computer on, but I was so determined to get to work," she said. "Now I have it down pat and do what needs done in the office.
 "We're now talking about buying a home, something I never thought I'd be able to do. I speak to women about my story, about changing and doing the right thing. I really want to go back to the prison and talk to women. If I can get out of the hole I was in, which was all mud and no ladder, anybody can get out of that hole."
 The seven-week re-entry program focuses on job skills, behavioral issues and education needs. Valuable tools such as building healthy relationships, dealing with authority, writing resumes, navigating job interviews and handling money responsibly are addressed.
 Support is also offered to the families of the incarcerated through the new family restoration piece of the program. Family restoration helps spouses and children of inmates navigate the criminal justice system and deal with the trauma of their situations.
 Three re-entry program graduates of the 40-man class spoke during their graduation ceremony at the jail in November.
 "This program has given us hope," said Jerrold King. "It's been such an eye opener for me. The volunteers and program directors treat us like human beings and not enemies."
 Since 2015, several hundred men and women have graduated from the program, which works through a network of nine living-wage employers in the Peoria area.
 "We're fortunate we have such a good partnership with employers who are willing to take a chance and give people a second chance," said program volunteer Ron Budzinski. "Once they get meaningful employment, everything else falls into place."
 A most welcome spinoff of the program came this year from Father Paul Joseph Langevin, the pastor of Holy Family Parish on Sterling Avenue.
 The priest became aware of Jobs Partnership, attended several graduation ceremonies and was touched by the program's value to society.
 "To see the transformation of these men engaged in faith-based learning ... is truly a form of sacred healing," he said. "We cannot lock them up, disregard them and then expect they will come out healed on their own."
 Langevin reached out to Parks and offered his church as a Christmastime vehicle to help the incarcerated men at the jail.
 Last month, the parish's annual Christmas Giving Tree was dedicated to them, displaying in its branches message tags citing gift requests from inmates. The gifts, later given from the incarcerated to their children, were purchased and left under the tree by Holy Family parishioners. The parish provided 73 gifts to 51 inmates' families.
 "I am very grateful to our parishioners and tremendously proud of them in helping support these men," said the pastor. "Some of them perhaps were giving their son or daughter a Christmas gift for the first time in their lives."
 Parks expressed her thanks and gratitude to Holy Family.
 "The men were overwhelmed to have gifts to send to their children," she said. "It was a blessing because normally we have to go out and raise funds for this. I'm so thankful the church chose us. It was just phenomenal."
 More than 150 volunteers around the state have also chosen the program to impart their varied knowledge and wisdom in a classroom setting. Parks is grateful for the strong outreach of volunteerism that makes the program work but expressed the need for more volunteers.
 Anyone interested in offering their expertise as a teaching volunteer or in making a financial donation to the program should call the Jobs Partnership offices at 682-2360 or send an email to jobspartnershippeoria@gmail.com. For a broader overview of the organization and some detailed videos, go to jobspartnershippeoria.org.
 A second Jobs Partnership office, called the Financial Opportunity Center, will open this month at the Wraparound Center located in Trewyn Middle School. A financial coach and an employment coach will be available for assistance.
 The Browns offer an empathetic variety of volunteerism by telling inmates their life stories and how the Jobs Partnership Re-Entry program has changed them.
 "The people of Jobs Partnership have done a plethora of things to help me succeed," said Tyrone Brown. "I'm forever grateful to them."
 When he was asked to speak to a recent graduating class at the jail, Brown didn't hesitate.
 "I told them my story and inspired and encouraged them that they can change," he said. "I told them I was sitting in the same chair and wearing the same outfit you're wearing. Now I'm able to come back and tell you there's a better way. They got a lot out of that. I think if I helped one of them, I helped many. This program is beautiful."

You still have to try and do the right thing; you have to try and get something out of those games, especially the bench players that really don’t get the consistent minutes. It gives you the opportunity to step up and almost earn extra minutes by the way you play. I thought Frank (Jackson) did a great job, and I thought he was locked in defensively. Those are the kinds of things that, when you get an opportunity, you’ve got to be ready to take advantage of that opportunity.”

TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Hillsborough Circuit Judge Lisa Campbell expected to learn that an ancestor’s grave could be beneath MacDill Air Force Base when news broke in November that the lost Port Tampa Cemetery for African-Americans might be there. After all, she said, her family has ties to Port Tampa dating back to its inception at the turn of the 20th century. Last week, the Tampa Bay Times informed Campbell that her maternal grandparents’ stillborn baby was buried in Port Tampa Cemetery in 1930. “It was expected,” Campbell said, “but it’s still hurtful.” Next month, the Air Force’s Civil Engineer Center and private sector archaeologists will begin the physical search for the early-20th century burial ground on the land near the corner of Interbay Boulevard and Manhattan Avenue where it was located before the base was built. Today, the property is largely vacant, with just a few roads and trees. Campbell awaits the next step should they find human remains. “If we are in a position to provide DNA, we have two people who would be full blooded siblings,\" she said, those being her uncles Kelly and Morris Williams, 86 and 84. “We’d like for them to allow us to take those remains and bury them with other family.” If that is not an option, Campbell said, the base needs to “segregate off that section and keep it a cemetery in a way that allows people to go there.” Meanwhile, her family will work to identify other possible ancestors buried there. Anyone named Green, Jones or Sirmons could be related to them. Via a genealogy search, the Times identified Campbell as a relative of the stillborn baby born to her maternal grandparents Patrick and Reatha Williams. Port Tampa was established in the 1890s as a separate city. African- Americans moved there...

The Knights continued to improve on the tenets that have, thus far, made them one of the premier EWAC teams and a force to be reckoned with across the entire 2B level.
 "The entire team played with incredible defensive intensity," Bumgardner said. "They did a great job taking away the open guys and forcing the Jaguars into bad shots."
 Bumgardner noted three individuals in particular who have elevated the Knights' defense to another level.
 "Aaron Pollard was a defensive nightmare tonight," he said. "He made driving the lane pretty much impossible and swatted shot after shot, plus he's been instrumental in spacing the floor and making our offense easier to run."
 "Furthermore," he continued, "our perimeter defense was rock solid; Jake Freedle and Isaias Santellano have done a great job of patrolling the passing lanes and creating opportunities on both ends of the floor, and Jake has done a great job of finishing in the lane when his number is called."
 Santellano has been a particular point of interest in WWVA's recent success.
 "We've changed a few things about the way we play, both on offense and defense," Bumgardner said, "and Isaias has really risen to the challenge we've given him. He's spacing the floor well and finding the open guys on offense, and his energy on defense is absolutely unmatched. He's reading the passing lanes and clamping down on the perimeter, and he's creating so many opportunities for the team."
 Jake Freedle and Aaron Pollard each scored 17 for the Knights on the night, and Gabriel Torres added seven more.
 WWVA (8-3, 4-1) will hit the road on Monday for a tough conference game with Liberty Christian (6-4, 1-1), scheduled to start at 7:30.

“We had an initial ribbon cutting when we took over in 2015, and this is an important anniversary,” Shawn said. “It’s something we wanted to mark.”
 The recognition also helped the Playhouse kick off its new season with two interactive murder mystery performances of “A Very Brady Murder” Friday and Saturday.
 The 2020 dinner and a show season starts this upcoming Friday with “Bonnie & Clyde,” which loosely recounts the true lives and crimes of infamous Depression-era bank robbers Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow. The show runs until Feb. 23.
 “We’re always trying to bring something new and exciting to our audiences,” Laura said.
 Next up will be “A Comedy of Tenors,” a sequel to “Lend Me a Tenor,” which the Martins put on during their first season at the Playhouse. “Mamma Mia!” will run through the summer, followed by “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,” and finally “A Christmas Carol” to end the year.
 The classic Christmas tale, the first show repeat for the couple, will now be a traditional annual production to conclude the season, they said.
 While Shawn said the shows themselves are important, he insists it’s really all about that evening — sitting at a table with other people, getting lost in the art and bonding over a meal and drinks with everyone’s phones shut off.
 “The internet is still there when you leave here,” he said.
 Laura said it was vitally important to support small businesses with so many closing in every industry. She said everyone at the Playhouse feels blessed to still be a small, family-owned business continually supported by the community.
 “In a world where we’re so consumed with stuff, we are proud that we’re providing an experience to people to make memories with their friends and families and loved ones. You can lose stuff, but you will always have those memories,” she said.
 With the Playhouse around for more than three decades — Shawn being involved since 1995 and Laura coming on board in 2007 — generations have been able to cycle through, with people who came as children now bringing their own in for shows.
 Laura said the couple have a vision for the theater, and they constantly want to make improvements and dream of how to grow and keep the legacy going.
 “There’s more to come,” Shawn assured.

Pakistan's foreign minister is visiting Tehran on Sunday in a bid to defuse rising tensions in the region after the killing of Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani in a US drone strike.
 For decades Pakistan has tried to balance its strong relationship with Saudi Arabia and ties with Iran, with whom it shares a near 1,000-kilometre (625-mile) border.
 Sunday's visit comes as tensions mount across the Middle East following the 62-year-old general's death in Iraq, and Iran's admission that it shot down an airliner by mistake, killing 176 people on board.
 "Recent developments seriously endanger peace and security in an already volatile region and underscore the need for immediate and collective efforts for a peaceful resolution," Pakistan's foreign office said in a statement.
 Shah Mehmood Qureshi will convey to Iran "Pakistan's readiness to support all efforts that facilitate resolution of differences and disputes through political and diplomatic means", it said.
 After meeting his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif, Qureshi will visit Saudi Arabia on January 13 to hold talks with Saudi foreign minister Faisal bin Farhan.
 The minister will also visit the US after concluding his visit to Tehran and Riyadh, a source in Pakistan's foreign office confirmed.
 Last year Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan travelled between Saudi Arabia and Iran in a bid to calm relations between the rivals.
 Pakistan has good relations with Saudi Arabia, with more than 2.5 million of its nationals living and working in the kingdom, but it also maintains close ties with Iran and represents Tehran's consular interests in the United States.

The Wildcats enjoyed plenty of success as five wrestlers posted 10-0 records. Zach Starr (106), Zaden Meyer (113), Landen Harbaugh (126) and Oyster (220) all won their weight classes, while Brandan Myers (120) also was undefeated.
 Despite having a few injuries and being down four starters most of the weekend, the Wildcats’ depth was able to pull through.
 Williamsport went 5-0 on Saturday, defeating Magruder, Frederick, Northwood, Thomas Johnson and Walkersville. The Wildcats opened the day with a 42-41 victory over Magruder.
 “It’s huge because they’re young guys stepping in,” Rechtorovic said of his team’s depth, “freshmen and sophomores stepping in to replace these guys and getting some match time and some confidence because they all got some wins.
 “That’s just going to help us down the road for the rest of this season and the next couple of years.”
 The Wildcats and Rebels will look to get healthy and keep the momentum going as they each push for one of the four spots in the 1A West region duals in February.
 “A little banged up coming in, we just gotta get guys healthy,” Nalley said. “We’re about halfway through our dual season, so as along as we finish strong, we should make region duals.”
 The host Rebels went 5-5 on the weekend, beating Thomas Johnson and Saint James on the second day.
 Caleb Everhart won the 138-pound weight class with a 10-0 weekend, while Nick Kelbaugh also went 10-0 at 160 pounds.
 In the match that ended up deciding the 138-pound title, Everhart egded Northeast-AA’s Billy Katzenberger 2-0. The South senior scored the lone points on a first-period takedown in the battle of state-ranked wrestlers.

Jeff Hubl has worked at the fieldhouse part time since 2011. During the years, he has seen the growth of the facility and how it has become a vital part of the community for people of all ages.
 “This has been a great facility for the community because during the winter months you have families who come here to play volleyball or basketball, they can use the softball and baseball cages,” Hubl said. “We didn’t have that before. Trying to get a school gym was tough. So, this is a good opportunity for families to get out and do something during the winter months.”
 The fieldhouse is one of many recreation use areas operated by the Grand Island Parks and Recreation Department. Along with Grand Island’s many parks and athletic fields, the city also has Island Oasis Water Park, Heartland Public Shooting Park, and Jackrabbit Run Golf Course.
 Watching the high school kids play indoor soccer Saturday morning was Jeremy Jensen. As former Grand Island mayor and now a Nebraska State Fair board member, he said the fieldhouse has become part of the fabric of Grand Island and has grown in popularity so much that another indoor multipurpose facility is not out of the question down the road.
 Jensen is also the coach of the Grand Island Senior High outdoor soccer team that plays in the spring. He was there watching his player, and others play soccer as he begins preparation for the upcoming outdoor soccer season.
 “This fieldhouse has been a massive addition to our community,” he said. “You come out here at any time of the year, and it is full. The reality is, as nice as this facility is, we could use something five times this size, and the entire facility would be full all the time as well.”
 Jensen said watching the indoor high school soccer teams play allows him to see not only the talent that is at the high school, but also players from the other schools around the area.
 “You kind of take it for granted now that the facility is here, but before 2011, it is hard to imagine what the community was doing to fulfill these needs,” he said. “From a soccer perspective, a lot of these kids would go out of town, such as Omaha, to play during the winter. It is really nice to have something here in our community for these boys as well.”
 Jensen said it is amazing to see how much the facility is used by people of all ages.
 “I was out here last week, and there was a baseball team fielding grounders. It is obviously very much a multi-use facility,” he said. “It is something we are fortunate to have. Now that we are celebrating 10 years, I am really hopeful we can duplicate something similar to this and even enlarge it.

A task force formed to study ways to reduce property tax burden on Illinois residents is calling for consolidation of school districts and other local units of government and a boost in the state's share of funding for K-12 education.
 Those and other recommendations are part of a draft report circulated among the 88-member Property Tax Relief Task Force that state lawmakers formed during the 2019 session. A final report is expected to be released before the 2020 legislative session begins Jan. 28.
 The bill creating the task force was part of a package of legislation also including a proposed constitutional amendment to allow for a graduated income tax. And while the draft report does not mention the proposed amendment, which will appear on the November general election ballot, Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker has said that he wants at least some of the new income tax revenue to be used for property tax relief if voters approve the amendment.
 Rising property taxes have been a political flash point in Illinois for many years. The current system dates back to a 1901 Illinois Supreme Court decision that overturned the tax levying method that was used until that time, according to the draft report.
 The report notes, however, that property ownership today is no longer the indicator of wealth and ability to pay that it was in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It also states the current system is full of special exemptions for select groups of property owners -- including Tax Increment Financing districts, or TIFs, that have the effect of shifting the tax burden onto other property owners.
 The document also notes that local governments in Illinois -- school districts in particular -- rely more heavily on property tax revenue than in other states. Local property taxes account for two-thirds of all funding for public schools in Illinois, while state funding accounts for only about 26 percent.
 "Today's reliance on property taxes underscores how broken the system of funding local government services has become," the report states. "Too many units of government rely too heavily on property taxes, which are predicated on the value of something that is most often unrelated to the owners' ability to pay."
 The report argues the property tax system should be reformed on several levels, including how property values are determined, consolidating townships and other local units of government, and reducing or eliminating some property tax exemptions.
 But addressing the issue of education funding would likely have the biggest impact because school taxes make up the bulk of most people's property tax bills.
 Rep. Sam Yingling, D-Grayslake, one of eight co-chairs of the task force, said in an interview that one way to increase the state's share of school funding would be to expand the state's sales tax base to cover certain services not currently taxed. He added that also allow the state to reduce its sales tax rate.
 The report also notes that one task force member, Chicago Democratic Rep. Mary Flowers, who co-chaired the subcommittee on social and economic disparities, "recommends the removal of school districts from the property tax system so that the State of Illinois has sole funding responsibility for K-12 schools."
 Illinois also has an unusual system of organizing public schools, with 850 individual districts. Of those, more than 300 serve only grades K-8 and nearly 100 serve only high school students. The remainder are known as "unit" districts that serve all grades from K-12.
 "Each of these has administrative staff and combining them into unified school districts will result in efficiencies of scale," the draft report states. "The degree and scope of savings will vary from district to district and from school to school, but in parts of the state, merger will make great financial sense, and without raising concerns about geographic dislocation for students."
 Rep. Stephanie Kifowit, an Oswego Democrat who served as co-chair of the task force's school funding subcommittee, said in an interview that she agrees with the need for school district consolidation.
 "When you talk about school funding and single purpose districts such as K-8 or high school districts, the residents have to know that they are essentially being almost double-taxed versus a unit district," she said.
 By way of example, Kifowit shared a photograph she took of a constituent's property tax bill. The bill was for a home in Park Forest, a village south of Chicago in Cook County. The home was valued at just over $128,000 and the tax bill was for more than $13,000. That included more than $7,000 levied by two school districts.
 The task force was originally supposed to deliver its final report to the governor and General Assembly by Dec. 31, but Yingling said members felt it was important to get feedback on the draft from all four legislative caucuses - Republicans and Democrats in the state House and Senate. He said he expects a final report to be complete before the 2020 session begins Jan. 28.
 Once the final report is released, its recommendations will be drafted into legislation for the General Assembly to consider this year.
 "It's gonna take longer than one session in one year to fix but I think this is a great first step in the right direction," Kifowit said. "And I think that we can have a commonsense solution for to really work to lower property taxes for our residents."
 But not everyone on the task force was pleased with the draft report.
 "As a current draft, the final report is nothing more than a collection of thoughts with no real recommendations, put together by only a handful of people," Rep. Joe Sosnowski, R-Rockford, said in a statement. "There was no actual discussion or debate at the committee level on this report. This grossly oversized task force was created in a deal with the Governor to convince reluctant legislators to support an income tax increase being placed on the ballot, apparently to provide them with political cover. Instead of bringing us closer to achieving meaningful and lasting property tax relief for Illinois families, this draft report is a complete disaster that fails to live up to its intended purpose."

MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Disgraced Cardinal George Pell has been transferred from a Melbourne prison after a drone illegally flew overhead in a suspected attempt to photograph the famous inmate, a newspaper reported on Sunday. The most senior Catholic to be convicted of child sex abuse had been transferred from the Melbourne Assessment Prison where he has been held since February last year on convictions of molesting two choirboys at the city's cathedral in the late 1990s, the Herald Sun newspaper reported. The move came after a drone flew over a prison garden where Pope Francis' former finance minister is employed weeding and watering plants, the newspaper reported. The Justice Department on Sunday confirmed \"an incident involving a drone flying over the Melbourne Assessment Prison on Thursday,\" but would no comment on the 78-year-old cleric's whereabouts. Pell had been transferred to the maximum-security Barwon Prison near Geelong, southwest of Melbourne, the newspaper reported. Flying a drone within 120 meters (394 feet) of a Victorian prison is an offense that carries a potential two-year prison sentence. The incident has been reported to police but no arrest has been made. Pell has been sentenced to six years in prison and is no longer a member of Francis' Council of Cardinals or a Vatican official. A state appeals court in August rejected the cardinal's application to overturn the convictions in a two-to- one majority decision. Seven judges of Australia's High Court will hear his challenge to that decision in March. The court is Pell's last avenue of appeal.

It was not necessary for the army to respond immediately to Prof Zulum's outburst beyond promising to investigate the allegations. They should have just noted the allegations, acknowledged the sufferings the people underwent at checkpoints, and promised to get to the bottom of the problem, with an assurance that they would re-examine their methods and ensure that they gained or regained the confidence of the people on whose behalf they policed the roads in the first instance. But consistent with a culture that has pervaded their operations in the past few decades, a culture some powerful Western countries have repeatedly deplored, the army rushed out a prepared statement and insinuated that states blighted by insurgency should be so grateful that whatever complaints they have must either be muted or privately enunciated.

SPRINGFIELD -- Illinois House Republicans on Wednesday blasted a draft final report from the special Property Tax Relief Task Force that lawmakers formed last year. They said the panel's Democratic majority summarily rejected dozens of proposals from Republicans.
 "Following the release of their draft within the last week, we once again see [House Democrats] refuse to be serious … at a time when our citizens are so desperate and wanting for change in state government," House GOP Leader Jim Durkin, of Western Springs, said during a news conference in Chicago.
 The draft report has been circulating among the 88 members of the task force -- or about half of the General Assembly -- as the group prepares to issue a final report to Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker and the legislature ahead of the start of the 2020 legislative session Jan. 28.
 It calls for, among other things, having the state take over a greater share of funding responsibility for public schools, consolidating potentially hundreds of elementary school and high school districts into full K-12 "unit" districts, and extending the state sales tax to various services that aren't currently taxed to raise state revenue that could be used to lower local property taxes.
 Among the Republican proposals not discussed in the draft report, according to Rep. Deanne Mazzochi, of Elmhurst, was cutting pension benefits for new employees of local governments and school districts and capping pensions for school administrators.
 "We propose capping administrator pensions so that they can't exceed the average household income in the state of Illinois, because administrative pensions are going absolutely crazy and driving costs up," she said. "None of these were up for debate or up for consideration."
 In a separate interview, Rep. Sam Yingling, a Grayslake Democrat who served as one of the co-chairs of the task force, said Illinois did reduce pension benefits for new employees in 2010 when it adopted the so-called "Tier 2" pension plan. But he added federal law requires that in workplaces that offer pension benefits in lieu of Social Security, the benefits must be at least as generous as what Social Security provides.
 He also noted the state now offers the option of opting out of the pension plan in favor of a 401(k)-style savings plan and that it is also offering buyouts of future benefits.
 In response to the charge that House Republican ideas weren't considered, Yingling said the draft report was sent to all four legislative caucuses -- Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate -- for their suggested edits, but that the House Republicans so far have not responded.
 "The four caucuses were going to take the draft report back to their caucuses for edits, either additions or subtractions," he said. "And then we never heard back from the House Republicans, and as far as I'm concerned we're still waiting for their edits. They have apparently chosen to go this route instead. … So, we're still waiting on the House Republicans."
 Property tax reform is expected to be a significant topic in the upcoming legislative session and Gov. Pritzker has made it a high priority for his administration.
 "The governor appreciates the work of the property (tax) relief taskforce and looks forward to continuing productive conversations around property tax relief this session," a spokeswoman said in an email.
 The statement went on to note that this year's state budget includes a substantial increase in public school funding and that he recently signed a bill to consolidate hundreds of local police and firefighter pension plans, both of which are expected to result in property tax relief.

Southampton stunned Leicester City 2-1 at the King Power Stadium on Saturday thanks to a late goal from Danny Ings and a lucky strike from midfielder Stuart Armstrong, as the Saints put their 9-0 thrashing in the return fixture in October behind them.The win came on the back of a vastly improved display from Southampton and keeps Ralph Hasenhuettls side in 12th place in the table on 28 points.The in-form Ings, who had missed a slew of chances earlier in the match, struck the winner - his 14th league goal of the campaign - in the 81st minute after collecting a through pass from substitute Che Adams.The hosts thought they had levelled the tie at 2-2 in the final seconds of regulation time when Jonny Evans nodded in a free-kick from James Maddison. But the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) judged the defender to be in an offside position.We did everything we could to turn it around, and weve done that and better. So proud of the team, Ings, who struck the crossbar twice in the first half, told the BBC.We take each game as it comes. We have smiles on our faces, we are getting back to enjoying football.#WeMarchOn pic.twitter.comeWP5yXxk1s— Southampton FC (@SouthamptonFC) January 11, 2020×Leicester had earlier gone ahead in the 14th minute through midfielder Dennis Praets first goal for the club, as he tapped the ball in after Jamie Vardy ran on to a lobbed pass and fired a cross into the penalty area.Southampton levelled five minutes later as Armstrongs curling left-footed shot went in after a deflection off Maddison giving Kasper Schmeichel no chance in goal.Southampton were then given a second-half penalty when Caglar Soyuncu brought down Shane Long in the box, but VAR deemed that he was marginally offside in the build-up and also rescinded the yellow card issued to the Leicester defender.Hasenhuettl hailed his teams best away performance of the season so far.We played fantastically quick behind the lines. We had to be nervous until the end but we tried to press them high and keep them away from our goal, the Austrian said.It was a very important game... We changed completely our mind and worked so hard to find a successful way, and at the moment to see this team play is enjoyable all the time.Leicester, who had a number of chances in the match, remain second on 45 points but defending champions Manchester City could leapfrog them if they beat Aston Villa on Sunday.A disappointing day for us. We thought we would come away with a point which, possibly we would not have deserved, Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers said.We were just not quite at our best today. Normally we are good defensively. We didnt press well enough and we made too many mistakes with the ball.

Yes I have got a few stitches but am recovering fast. #jersey has taken a little bit of my blood but a script this good deserves that in the least. Have a good one you all. Keep it real.

The actor, who has a heavily bruised lower lip, is out of action for a few days and will resume shooting for Jersey as soon as the swelling reduces.Also read | Akshay Kumar, Twinkle Khanna give us a peek inside their dabbas, nominate Katrina Kaif and Bhumi Pednekar.

Gowtam Tinnanuri, who directed the original, has come on board to helm the remake as well.Earlier, Shahid told IANS that he was hesitant to do another remake right after Kabir Singh (a remake of the Telugu hit Arjun Reddy), but Jersey moved him. The film tells the story of a failed cricketer who returns to the game at the age of 36."Personally, I could relate with this story because, I too, am 38 years old. Sometimes, I also used to feel that I am not delivering a blockbuster film, so what should I do? Should I try something else? There is a time in everyone's life when we wonder why we are not doing well in life. Then you do something else, or make some kind of compromise," he said.Shahid revealed that he cried four times while watching Jersey. "Deep down, I feel you should do things you love or feel connected to, whether you get success or not. You should feel satisfaction in heart while doing what you do. That's the message of this film. Actually, I cried four times when I saw the film. This character is not like Kabir Singh at all. He is very quiet and introverted in nature. But his journey is inspiring," he said.Produced by Allu Aravind, Aman Gill and Dil Raju, the Jersey remake is scheduled to hit the theatres on August 28, 2020.Follow @htshowbiz for more

The army later explained that the lockdown was because of some skirmishes with elements of Boko Haram along the highway. Face-to-face with the governor at the checkpoint, they were silent on the ID card issue, and also refused to confirm that any soldier asked for or took a bribe. Later, after regaining their composure, the army, through their media coordinator, Aminu Iliyasu, issued a censorious statement that gave the governor a slap on the wrist. The allegations would be investigated, they said, but it was impolitic of any state executive to engage in public outburst. Said Col Iliyasu: "The Nigerian Army as a professional and disciplined institution views such allegations seriously, particularly coming from a state executive. It is on record that, whenever such allegations of troops' misconduct were made in the past, the Nigerian Army never failed in conducting thorough investigations to establish them and where any infractions were established against any personnel, appropriate sanctions were applied in line with extant rules and regulations as provided for in the Armed Forces Act CAP A20 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria."

“It was our intention when we bought the theater to diversify the programming,” Shawn Martin said. “(Audiences) have a lot of choice. You see that with streaming entertainment, and the same thing is true with live entertainment.”
 In an effort to make downtown Hagerstown a destination, the Martins have chosen to focus on offering unique experiences to patrons, including Saturday morning Theater for Young Audiences. Adults and teenagers perform for children, who can take pictures with the cast afterward.
 In 2016, the Hagerstown couple added children’s performance theater through its summer camp for youths aged 4 to 18.
 Laura Martin said the camp has proven wildly popular, with a wait list to enroll every year and some of the children coming back to later perform on the Playhouse’s main stage.
 As is traditional with dinner theater, the talent is locally sourced.
 Laura said the Playhouse is filled with people who have chosen to pursue theater for their passion rather than their paycheck, but Shawn said that in no way means the shows are “amateur” or the actors lack experience.
 “The Playhouse is literally fueled by love because our performers love to perform,” Laura said. “The people who serve on the waitstaff are company members. It’s hard work, but they loving waiting tables. They love interacting with our patrons and giving them that Playhouse experience. It’s a pretty awesome thing to be a part of.”
 Despite riding the “entrepreneurial rollercoaster,” as Laura put it, the hard work is paying off.
 Patrons from a larger footprint have started making their way to the Playhouse to experience the intimate venue, including more people from Washington, D.C., Virginia and beyond.
 “So that’s been exciting. People are driving from farther and farther away to come to the Playhouse,” Laura said.
 Shawn said the hope is to not only keep the theater going, but to help out other local businesses as well.
 Out-of-town guests might end up staying overnight or make it a weekend by visiting landmarks like nearby Antietam National Battlefield, or getting a drink at Cannon Coffee down the street.
 While the Martins said they don’t feel like their business has been adversely affected by the ongoing construction at Barbara Ingram School for the Arts and The Maryland Theatre down the road, Shawn said “a couple of years without projects would be great.”
 35th anniversary
 Over the summer, the Playhouse underwent a considerable cosmetic remodel that included a new lobby and updated bar area, fresh flooring throughout the theater and new technical elements, like lighting and sound.
 All told, Shawn said it was about a $40,000 investment, with everything self- funded as the family-owned Playhouse receives no grants or taxpayer money.
 “Which, for a small business, is a sizable chunk of change,” he said.
 The idea was to make a more enjoyable space for patrons and build the “Playhouse brand.”
 “We offer a unique experience that you can only get there and the improvements help add value to people’s experience,” Shawn said.
 The remodel comes in time for the Martins’ fifth anniversary as the Playhouse’s owners and the theater’s 35th season.
 The Washington County Chamber of Commerce held a ribbon cutting to commemorate the event Friday.

After the throw, the ax must be returned manually - the boomerang effect is not automatic. This opens up the potential for many ligaments and makes Leviathan a tool rather than a weapon for slaughter. You can throw it on a large scale into a particularly nasty creature, turning it into a block of ice. While one enemy is immobilized, stun and tear in half the second. And then - to run away, in a jump, return Leviathan to the hand and chop on the ground, causing a large ice explosion. Beauty! True, sometimes you forget that the enchanted ax does not live its own life, and because of this you get stuck in stupid situations, but, as for me, this is a plus. More impressions.

LEGISLATIVE PREVIEW-TENNESSEETennessee lawmakers enter session with election in sightNASHVILLE, Tenn.

Other top issues include deciding whether to deliver Gov. Bill Lee's promise of criminal justice reform and whether to follow the national trend of passing abortion limits destined for court. The election-year legislative session starts Tuesday.

The utility says damage is widespread throughout Tennessee's most populous county, including downed trees and power poles, some of which will need to be replaced. The utility says restoration will be complicated because debris has to be removed before repairs can begin.OFFICER WOUNDEDTennessee authorities make drug arrest after chase, shootoutCHATTANOOGA, Tenn.

The lynchings of Eliza Woods in 1886 and John Brown in 1891 on the Madison County courthouse lawn had gone mostly ignored until last year.

Lee said Friday he believes a response will arrive in the summer because federal officials say they won't have an answer in the spring. Tennessee filed the $7.9 billion block grant proposal with federal officials in November. However, state lawmakers would need to vote on the final product. Lee says if a response came early enough this year he would be open to calling a special legislative session to get legislative approval as soon as possible.

I have written this before, but it bears repeating. Iran's theocratic leadership believes war is the path to revealing the "12th Imam," their version of the Christian second coming. The Mullahs of Iran are true believers who it appears are willing, even eager, to die for their cause, or more accurately have others die in their place.
 Here is the formula the "no more war" crowd doesn't get or refuses to accept. Iran and its proxies kill U.S. troops, along with Iranian and foreign civilians and we are supposed to take it. If America responds to Iran, as President Trump has done (unlike Obama and Clinton), we are the enemy of peace and guilty of "escalating" the conflict. War is never a one-way street, unless one side pre-emptively surrenders. Victory must be our goal and should be defined.

No sera con el calor veraniego, pero si con el que corresponde a un pais desertico como Arabia Saudi. A miles de kilometros del territorio madrileño, el Madrid y el Atletico se disputan un trofeo: el de la Supercopa, que este año estrena formato a cuatro y se juega a miles de kilometros de España. A las 19.00 horas los dos equipos invitados a tan abstrusa competicion se la juegan.
 El Madrid llega tras haber superado al Valencia con claridad. Y el Atletico, despues de haber eliminado al Barcelona y provocado un terremoto en el club azulgrana, que, quizas, se lleve al tecnico Valverde por delante.
 "Cuando veo a mis jugadores, no le tengo miedo a nada", inspira el Cholo Simeone a los suyos, tan acostumbrados a creer. "Ahora me veo mejor entrenador", contesta Zidane, fiel a su estilo, el mismo que dio tres Ligas de Campeones a los blancos. En la memoria de colchoneros y merengues hay dos precedentes esta temporada. El mas escandaloso fue en pretemporada. En plena gira americana, el Atletico le endoso al Madrid un resultado mas propio de un videojuego (3-7). En noviembre, en pleno momento de duda sobre el regreso mesianico de Zidane al Madrid, los blancos hicieron muy buen partido en el Wanda Metropolitano. Salvaron un empate (0-0).
 Ni la Supercopa era el trofeo mas importante de la temporada cuando tradicionalmente se jugaba en verano, ni lo es ahora, que se juega en invierno. Sin embargo, tanto el Atletico como el Madrid buscan levantar un titulo, el primero de la temporada, que refuerce sus buenos estados de forma y de animos.
 Zidane podria alinear a los brasileños Rodrygo y Vinicius, ineditos en semifinales, o al colombiano James Rodriguez. Mientras, Marcelo tambien podria ocupar el lateral izquierdo en lugar de Mendy. Por su parte, el Atletico perdio en la semifinal al capitan Koke Resurreccion, que entro en el segundo tiempo y volvio a caer lesionado, por lo que todo indica que el mexicano Hector Herrera jugara junto a Thomas Partey, flanqueado por Saul y Correa. El Cholo confirmo en la previa que el central uruguayo Jose Maria Gimenez esta fisicamente listo y podria entrar en la zaga como compañero de un Felipe que va a mas y en lugar de Savic. Arriba, nuevo examen para el portugues Joao Felix como compañero de Álvaro Morata.
 Con esas mimbres, el Atletico y el Madrid juegan un derbi madrileño en pleno desierto de Arabia. Un derbi que vale un titulo.
