And pregnant women, who are usually immunocompromised but have high levels of estrogen and progesterone, tend to have mild courses of the disease.
 “So something about being a woman is protective, and something about pregnancy is protective, and that makes us think about hormones,” Ghandehari said.
 Some experts who study sex differences in immunity, however, warned that hormones may fail to be the magic bullet that some are hoping for; even elderly women with COVID-19 are outliving their male peers, and there is a drastic reduction in levels of hormones for women after menopause.
 The genesis of the estrogen trial at the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University on Long Island stemmed from a similar observation, said Dr. Sharon Nachman, the trial’s principal investigator, who credited a Stony Brook surgeon, Dr. Anthony Gasparis, with the idea.
 The trial enrolled its first patient this past week, and preliminary results could be available in a few months, she said.
 “It’s totally out of the box, which is how good ideas often start,” said Nachman, associate dean for research at the Renaissance School, which is part of the State University of New York.

A further 13 deaths have been registered of people who had tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total under that measure to 1,262.
 A total of 1,762 people are in hospital being treated for the virus, with 134 of them in intensive care.
 Ms Sturgeon said there were "real signs of progress" in the latter figures, with the number of people in intensive care units down a third over the last two weeks.
 "The NHS has not been overwhelmed, which just a few weeks ago we really feared it might be," she said.
 "We have evidence that the actions all of us are taking are making a real and positive difference. However, this progress remains very fragile.
 "Now is a time for all of us to exercise careful caution. It's certainly not a time to throw caution to the winds. The margins we think we are working within in respect to the reproduction rate are very narrow."

The Scottish government has published a paper setting out options for a "phased" lifting of restrictions, with the aim of beginning a conversation about an "exit strategy" from lockdown.
 However Ms Sturgeon warned that "at this stage even a slight easing in restrictions" could see the virus "start to spread very quickly again".
 "The job is not done yet, we need you to stay the course for a bit longer," she added.
 "I know all this is difficult, and it gets more difficult with every day that passes, but it remains essential. Any easing up right now would see the virus surge upwards again, so please stick with it so we can continue to make progress together."
 ## Economic damage
 The first minister said she was "acutely aware" of the economic damage being done by the lockdown, but said any "premature easing up of these restrictions" could make it "even worse".
 She said businesses "should not contemplate" re-opening unless they could comply fully with guidance on social distancing and health and safety.
 Asking firms to "continue doing the right thing", she told them that the "precautionary principle" still applies "for the protection of your workers and customers".
 The first minister also said it was "good to see Boris Johnson back at work", and that the governments of the UK were "all absolutely united" in the overall goal of tackling the virus.
 The prime minister also said he did not want to "throw away" the progress made so far by relaxing the lockdown too quickly.

Scots must "stay the course" with the coronavirus lockdown or risk reversing the "fragile" progress made so far, Nicola Sturgeon has said.
 The first minister said "real progress" had been made, with hospital admissions stable and the number of patients in intensive care falling.
 However, she said even a slight lifting of restrictions could put this at risk.
 She added: "Any easing right now would see the virus surge upwards again, so please stick with it."
 Ms Sturgeon warned businesses that they should only contemplate re-opening if they can comply with social distancing guidance.

She said it would continue to hunt down the last few cases. Starting at midnight, certain businesses like construction can reopen, but with social distancing. Ardern said the nation was opening up the economy but not people’s social lives.

New Delhi, Apr 27 (PTI) Shares of asset management companies (AMCs) and other financial sector related firms zoomed up to 12 per cent on Monday after the Reserve Bank of India announced a Rs 50,000 crore special liquidity facility for mutual funds.


  RBI's announcement follows Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund's move to close six debt schemes amid liquidity crunch.


  Nippon Life India Asset Management jumped 11.38 per cent and HDFC Asset Management Company gained 5.26 per cent on the BSE.


  Other financial stocks also witnessed demand, with ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company rising 12.20 per cent, Max Financial Services 8.32 per cent, Manappuram Finance 6.86 per cent, HDFC Life Insurance Company 6.84 per cent, The New India Assurance Company 6.53 per cent and Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services 2.28 per cent.


  The BSE Finance index gained 2.09 per cent at close of trade.


  "The Indian markets had a promising start to the week largely led by a surge in banking and financial stocks following RBI's liquidity support to the stressed mutual funds," Ajit Mishra, VP - Research, Religare Broking Ltd said.


  Shares of RBL Bank advanced 9.16 per cent, IndusInd Bank 6.33 per cent, Kotak Mahindra Bank gained 5.15 per cent, Axis Bank rose by 5.74 per cent, ICICI Bank 3.85 per cent and State Bank of India 0.64 per cent.


  The BSE Bank index closed the day with 2.88 per cent gain. In a statement, the central bank said heightened volatility in capital markets in reaction to COVID-19 has imposed liquidity strains on mutual funds (MFs), which have intensified in the wake of redemption pressures related to closure of some debt MFs and potential contagious effects therefrom.


  The stress is, however, confined to the high-risk debt MF segment at this stage and the larger industry remains liquid, it said.


  "With a view to easing liquidity pressures on MFs, it has been decided to open a special liquidity facility for mutual funds of Rs 50,000 crore," it said.


  Meanwhile, the domestic stock market closed on a positive note with the BSE benchmark index gaining 415.86 points or 1.33 per cent at 31,743.08.


  "This is more of a confidence-boosting measure. This should help settle some of the panics that was caused over the weekend over the FT news," said Ashish Shanker, Head of Investments, Motilal Oswal Private Wealth Management.

But health experts worry that having the drug easily available at a time of heightened public fear could make it easier to misuse it. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday warned doctors against prescribing the drug, hydroxychloroquine, for treating the coronavirus outside of hospitals or research settings because of reports of serious side effects, including dangerous irregular heart rhythms and death among patients.
 It’s the latest admonition against the drug that Trump mentioned 17 times in various public appearances, touting its potential despite his own health advisors telling him it is unproven.
 Oklahoma spent $2 million to buy the drugs, and Utah and Ohio have spent hundreds of thousands on purchases. The rest of the cities and states received free shipments from drug companies or the U.S. government over the last month. Ohio received a large donation from a local company.
 Several states including New York, Connecticut, Oregon, Louisiana, North Carolina and Texas received donations of the medication from a private company based in New Jersey called Amneal Pharmaceutical. Florida was given 1 million doses from Israeli company Teva Pharmaceutical.
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency said Friday it has sent out 14.4 million doses of hydroxychloroquine to 14 cities, including Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and Baltimore, from the federal government’s national stockpile, a source that also provided South Dakota and California with supplies. The agency said earlier this month it had sent 19 million tablets and didn’t explain the discrepancy between the two figures. The U.S. government received a donation of 30 million doses from Swiss drugmaker Novartis on March 29 to build up the stockpile, which does not normally stock the drug.
 “If he (Trump) hadn’t amplified the early and inappropriate enthusiasm for the drug, I doubt if the states would have even been aware of it,” said Dr. Kenneth B. Klein, a consultant from outside of Seattle who has spent the last three decades working for drug companies to design and evaluate their clinical trials.
 Klein said it’s understandable that government and health officials looked into hydroxychloroquine — which is approved for treating malaria, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus — as a possible remedy during a frightening pandemic, but the time and energy has been misspent. The potential side effects are worrisome, especially because many coronavirus patients already have underlying health conditions, he said.
 “The states and the federal government are reacting in light of that fear. But it’s not a rational response,” Klein said.
 Doctors can already prescribe the malaria drug to patients with COVID-19, a practice known as off-label prescribing, and many do. Medical and pharmacy groups have warned against prescribing it for preventive purposes. The FDA has allowed it into the national stockpile, but only for narrowly defined purposes as studies continue.
 Utah Gov. Gary Herbert, a Republican, has previously acknowledged that the drug is “not without controversy,” but defended the state’s efforts to build up a supply. As questions mounted Friday, though, he distanced himself from an $800,000 purchase the state made from a local company and said it would be investigated.
 Herbert also halted a plan to spend $8 million more to buy 200,000 additional treatments. “The bottom line is, we’re not purchasing any more of this drug,” he said.

A: Biotechnology companies are very quickly trying to find therapies for the virus. One of the ways that we are getting more quickly to these engineered therapies is using machine learning. We’re trying to understand the human immune system. So if you have like a read out of all of the T cells in your body and understand the distribution of those T cells in your bloodstream, you should be able to understand what diseases your body is actively fighting or that has fought in the recent past. The trick is to build mapping between that T cell profile and the actual illnesses. That’s the thing that’s sort of evaded biologists forever. We are now able to use the techniques of machine learning to build that mapping and a blood test that may be able to help us understand how the immune system is responding.
