There’s little room for error threading a raft of barges three football fields long through L4-B. About 23 feet on either side, to be exact.
 Spanning the main shipping channel of the Mississippi River between La Crosse and La Crescent, the Canadian Pacific swing bridge has provided an essential rail link between eastern markets and the west for more than a century.
 Erected in 1902, it replaced an 1876 bridge that had been key to the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad’s efforts to connect the three cities. Built with concrete and steel rather than iron and stone, it incorporated the most sophisticated designs of its time, according to a 2006 report by Hess, Roise and Co.
 Construction took a year and claimed one life, 26-year-old Fred Rickleff, who was crushed under a steel beam.
 The swing span pivots on a 26-foot diameter drum that sits atop 52 steel rollers, which bear its weight when open. Complicated as it sounds, the design was favored because it was less expensive than bascule lift bridges, and had fewer moving parts.
 Originally powered by a steam engine, it’s now turned by electric motors fed by an underground cable and operated by Canadian Pacific crews, who staff the bridge around the clock during the river shipping season.
 The railway won’t say how often it swings open, but Army Corps of Engineers records show that during the past year 1,686 commercial and passenger vessels passed through lock and dam 7 just 2.5 river miles upstream.
 Providing an opening just 151 feet wide for modern barges that measure 105 feet across, the bridge has long been considered a navigation hazard.
 It’s on a list of nine such bridges the U.S. Coast Guard has designated for replacement or modification, though Congress has yet to allocate funds for its replacement.

There’s a sense of history in most Coulee Region communities, which is evident in the heart of downtown Galesville. The Downtown Galesville Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, and the public square is anchored by the bandstand, which was built in 1912.
 The downtown was first platted in 1854, and most of the buildings date from the 1880s to early 1900s with brick facades and elaborate cornice detail. Many list the date of their construction. A fire in 2005 destroyed the Grover Building in the middle of Davis Street, but a historically appropriate facade filled in the gap. In 2013 a new convenience store was built on the square in the same fashion when another building was razed.
 Galesville is steeped in history. Chief Decorah ruled a large Winnebago village nearby and a historical marker on Decorah’s Peak tells the story of how he routed a rival tribe in battle. His granddaughter Princess Marie Nounka is buried near Artic Springs on the north side of the lake that bears her name. Lake Marinuka was formed by when Beaver Creek was dammed for a mill. Founder Judge George Gale helped start Gale College, which today is Old Main, a community and arts center. The homestead of Alex A. Arnold, who helped start the county fair, is a 15-room Italianate farm house that sits on the northeast side of the city that is also open for tours.
 A statue on the edge of the downtown pays tribute to the Rev. David O. Van Slyke, a Methodist farmer and preacher who published a booklet declaring that Galesville was the Garden of Eden. The statue by Galesville sculptor Elmer Petersen shows Van Slyke with an apple in one hand and a Bible in the other.

The Ruplin Bakery was located at 412 S. Fourth St. and was in business from 1895 to 1950, according to local history files.

After making the three-day trip from Earth, the Chang’e 5 lander’s time on the moon is scheduled to be short and sweet. It can only stay one lunar daytime – about 14 days – because it lacks the radioisotope heating units that China’s current lunar rover, the Chang’e 4, possesses to withstand the moon’s freezing nights.
 Launched as a single space craft, Chang’e 5 is actually composed of a lander, ascender, service module and return capsule.
 The lander will dig for materials with its drill and robotic arm and transfer them to the ascender, which will lift off from the moon and dock with the service capsule. The materials will then be moved to the return capsule for the trip home to earth.
 Joan Johnson-Freese, a space expert at the US Naval War College, said that the technical complexity of Chang’e 5, with its four components, makes it “remarkable in many ways”.
 If successful, it could be a blueprint for a Mars sample return or even a crewed lunar mission.
 She added: “China is showing itself capable of developing and successfully carrying out sustained high-tech programmes, important for regional influence and potentially global partnerships.”
 China Moon Mission (AP)
 The mission, named after the Chinese moon goddess Chang’e, is among China’s boldest since it first put a man in space in 2003, becoming only the third nation to do so after the US and Russia.

 Philbrook and his wife, Heather Schmidt, of Camarillo, California, have been trying to convince court officials that he should be excused from jury duty because her father lives with them. But court officials told him that is not a valid reason and he must appear in court early next month.

The California Court of Appeal recognized in a 2018 ruling in the context of the constitutionality of mandatory immunization for school children that “compulsory immunization has long been recognized as the gold standard for preventing the spread of contagious diseases.”
 How, then, should a private employer address bona fide religious objections to its mandatory vaccination policy in light of this “gold standard” of prevention?
 California law prohibits an employer from discriminating against an employee whose religious beliefs conflict with a work rule, unless the employer proves it has explored any available reasonable alternative means of accommodating the religious belief but is unable to reasonably accommodate the religious belief “without undue hardship.” “Undue hardship” is defined as “an action requiring significant difficulty or expense” in light of five factors, including the impact of the accommodations on business operations.
 An employer faced with a religious objection to mandatory vaccination should consider offering that employee an alternative position, if one exists. An employer also may consider placing conditions on the employee working onsite, such as requiring the employee to wear personal protective equipment at work, submit to testing when his health justifies it, and keep a log of his temperature.

For decades, macroeconomists assume the Ricardian Equivalence holds. Therefore, they believe the effect of public debt on growth turns out to be neutral in the long run.  As shown in Barro (1974), the adverse impact of increasing public debt can be compensated by the positive effect of the instantaneous increase in private savings. This co-movement holds the national saving stay the same, and there is no extra driving force in growth. As the rise in S exactly equals the absolute value of the fall in T−G, the third identity keeps unchanged.

 # This Brockton music artist will play the keyboard on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon
 Marc Larocque
 The Enterprise
 BROCKTON — Isaiah Valmont grew up as a creative child in Brockton, teaching himself to play the piano after his mother paid for a few lessons to get him started, honing his musical talents as a teenager by supplying catchy beats to local rappers and always performing hymns each Sunday morning at a Haitian church in the city.
 “At that point, I knew music is something I wanted to do,” Valmont said. “I didn’t know I would make a career out of it. But it’s what I spent all my time doing. I was 10 years old when I first started. I was playing sports, but my mom took me out of that because I wasn’t the athletic type. She got me a trumpet and a piano.”
 Valmont, 22, is now realizing his goals as a music producer, recently getting signed by the increasingly popular music making collective and record label called Internet Money, which in August put out the chart-topping hip hop song “Lemonade” with rapper Gunna, featuring Don Toliver and Nav.
 On Tuesday night, Valmont and other musicians from Internet Money are expected to appear for a performance of “Lemonade” on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. Valmont will be playing keyboard for the prerecorded show.
 “It’s definitely surreal, it doesn’t even feel real to me right now,” said Valmont, who graduated in 2016 from Brockton High School, where he also played guitar, trumpet and tuba. “It’s almost like it’s a dream. I’m taking it all in.”
 Valmont just returned from Los Angeles where he spent a month with Internet Money, getting signed by the group and spending countless hours in the music studio, working tediously from behind the keyboard on new projects with some of the hottest names in hip-hop, including the label’s co-founders Taz Taylor and Nick Mira.
 Valmont described one studio session that lasted from 2 p.m. to 2 a.m., with a nonstop marathon of experimentation and music composition, aiming to create music that is both timeless and catchy.
 “It’s a house full of young producers, creators and artists. I got signed literally two weeks ago,” said Valmont, keyboardist for the group. “I hardly slept for a second. I played music from when I opened my eyes to when I closed my eyes. We didn’t leave and ordered food in. That was basically our lives every day, constantly working and trying to find the next hit.”
 This comes after Valmont, who also teaches piano lessons on the side, signed a management deal in January this year. Valmont made a name for himself within Boston hip-hop circles while attending UMass Amherst, where he studied political science and spent much his free time bunkered down in a dorm room developing new beats.
 “I became a producer mainly because I had friends in high school that started rapping,” Valmont said. “I’ve been doing music all my life. I kind of put two and two together. I thought, maybe if I play melodies and add some drums, maybe people could start rapping to it. My first beats weren’t the best. But over the years, I’d constantly lock myself in my room downstairs or my college dorm and I got better over time.”
 Valmont said he’s now spending time with family during the holidays, playing piano on Sundays for Restoration Community Church, before he plans to return to California to continue working on music with Internet Money.
 For Valmont, being able to showcase his talents with a popular hip hop group that’s on the rise is a “dream come true.”
 “I feel like I’m walking in my purpose now,” Valmont said. “It feels great. It’s everything I prayed for. Now I’m in the room with these huge artists and huge names that we hear on the radio. I’ve been accepted into the community like I’m one of them. I’m playing on all these huge records. I definitely owe it all to God and my mom.”
 Louna Mahotiere, Valmont’s mother, a dental assistant who was born in Haiti, said she is “extremely proud” of her son. Mahotiere mentioned that an award for music and good behavior was named after him at Ashfield Middle School, and he played the piano for the Haitian Assembly of God Church on Court Street starting at age 12.
 “I’m beyond proud. With God’s grace, I raised such an amazing young man,” Mahotiere said. “I give all the glory to God. I always raised him to be humble and put God first. I always tell him to be kind to people. I have to say, he is a kind and well-grounded young man.”
 Mahotiere, who also has a daughter and two foster children, said she’s excited to see her son on national television performing on the Jimmy Fallon show.
 “When he called me and told me he’ll be on Jimmy Fallon, I was driving on my way to church,” she said. “I started praising God. For me, I couldn’t believe that. I’m very excited. I can’t wait to see him there. When my son was in fifth grade, I went to a parent-teacher conference. The teacher told me she was going to read about him on the newspaper or see him on TV one day. And it’s happening.”
 Valmont said has a passion for making hip-hop music, pop and R&B; and hopes to use his talents to give back to his family and community.
 “My goal with music is to take care of my mom,” he said. “I want to give her back that money she provided me, to play piano and get my first lessons, and more. I want to take care of my family and make a difference in my community.”
 Valmont encouraged others artists from Brockton to follow their dreams.
 “You can do anything you put your mind to,” he said “Don’t give up. Trust God. Trust yourself. And trust in your dreams. If I was to listen to everyone who says there’s only one-in-a-million chance you’ll make it, I probably would have adopted that mentality. But you just have to believe in yourself more than anyone else and just go.”

The flight-tracking website FlightRadar24.com showed a Gulfstream IV private jet took off from Tel Aviv on Sunday night and flew south along the edge of Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula before turning toward Neom and landing. The flight took off from Neom over three hours later and followed the same route back to Tel Aviv.
 Pompeo, who was in Israel last week, traveled with a small group of American reporters on his trip throughout the Mideast, but left them at the Neom airport when he went into his visit with the crown prince.
 While Bahrain, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates have reached deals under the Trump administration to normalize ties with Israel, Saudi Arabia so far has remained out of reach. The Trump administration, as well as Netanyahu, would love to add the Saudis to that list before it leaves office in January. In Sudan, a military official said an Israeli delegation was in the country on Monday to discuss the normalization efforts. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the visit with the media.
 King Salman long has supported the Palestinians in their effort to secure an independent state as a condition for recognizing Israel. However, analysts and insiders suggest his 35-year-old son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, likely is more open to the idea of normalizing relations without major progress in the moribund peace process.
 Israel and Saudi Arabia have a shared interest in countering archrival Iran, and they have welcomed the Trump administration’s pressure campaign on the Iranians, which included withdrawing from the international nuclear deal with Iran and imposing tough economic sanctions on the Tehran government.
 The reported meeting puts even more pressure on Iran ahead of an incoming Biden administration that has signaled a potential willingness to return to the 2015 nuclear deal.
 “I think there’s a message to Iran. Look, there’s a front against you. There’s two months to go to the new administration. Beware. We are on the same page,” said Yoel Guzansky, a senior fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies, a prestigious Israeli think tank.
 In an apparent message to President-elect Joe Biden, Netanyahu said in a speech Sunday evening, shortly before the reported trip to Saudi Arabia: “We must not return to the previous nuclear deal.”
 In the same speech, Netanyahu also praised “trailblazing Arab leaders who understand the benefits of peace” and predicted “we will see other states that widen the circle of peace.”
 In another possible reference to the Saudi meeting, a Netanyahu aide, Topaz Luk, accused Netanyahu’s rival and coalition partner, Defense Minister Benny Gantz, of “playing politics at the same time that the prime minister is making peace.” Gantz on Sunday launched an investigation into Israel’s purchase of German submarines — a scandal that has turned several close Netanyahu confidants into criminal suspects. Netanyahu himself is not a suspect.
 The reported visit Sunday night to Neom, still a largely undeveloped desert region alongside the north end of the Red Sea, also reflected Prince Mohammed’s ambitions.
 It brought two world leaders to Neom, which he hopes will become a futuristic, skyline-studded Saudi version of Dubai that will offer the kingdom jobs and cement a future beyond its vast crude oil reserves. It also would reframe a rule so far colored by the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi and the kingdom’s grinding war in Yemen.
 It was unclear where the three men met, though the Saudi royal family has massive mansions along the turquoise waters of the Red Sea, with a major golf course.
 Netanyahu has long signaled back-channel relations with the Saudis, though the nations have never officially confirmed a meeting between their leaders. But Saudi Arabia appears to have given its blessing to the decisions of its Gulf neighbors, the UAE and Bahrain, to establish ties with Israel.
 The kingdom approved the use of Saudi airspace for Israeli flights to the UAE. Bahrain normalizing ties also suggest at least a Saudi acquiescence to the idea, as the island kingdom relies on Riyadh.

South Africa paceman Kagiso Rabada has underlined his personal commitment to the Black Lives Matter movement in light of the Proteas’ decision not to take a knee during the forthcoming series against England.
 Rabada has previously spoken about how the teachings of Nelson Mandela inspired his belief in social responsibility and publicly backed BLM earlier this year.
 The 25-year-old was not involved in the 3TC match in July, when a host of leading South African players and officials made the symbolic gesture of taking a knee and raising a fist, and national head coach Mark Boucher has since announced his team will not be doing so against England.
 They may instead wear black armbands as part of the country’s wider recognition for those lost to the Covid-19 pandemic and to raise awareness of violence against women.
 Invited to offer his own take, Rabada said: “I’ve already expressed my views on that. I’ll see if I want to express them again.
 “As a sportsman, spreading the right message is important. It is a huge responsibility, the things you say and stand up for.
 Kagiso Rabada (centre) in action against England. (PA Archive)
 “We spoke about it as a group and there are a lot of things to look at. Black Lives Matter is 100 per cent something I’ll always stand for and speak for myself.
 “It was a team decision not to kneel and I think to look at gender-based violence and devote ourselves to another cause. BLM will always be relevant and something I’ll always believe in, but Mark has stated that the team won’t be kneeling and that’s how it is.”
 Rabada is coming into the series fresh from a productive time in the Indian Premier League, during which he took 30 wickets for Delhi Capitals to finish top of the overall bowling charts.
 And while his game is clearly in good order, he admits the challenge of transferring directly from one team bubble in Dubai to another in Cape Town – albeit in the luxury of the five-star Vineyard Hotel near Newlands – has been a mental drain.
 You've basically lost your freedom. It's like luxury prisons
 “It can be quite tough. You can’t interact, you’ve basically lost your freedom,” he said.
 “It’s like luxury prisons, but you just have to remind yourself how fortunate we are. People are struggling at the moment and we must be grateful for the opportunity to earn money and do what we love. We stay in great hotels, (but) it’s like a spoiled kid not getting what they want at the candy store.
 “You’re just surrounded by four walls most of the time and that can be a factor mentally. Once we start playing it will take away from the desolate times.”

ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkey and Germany were at loggerheads over an incident in the Mediterranean Sea, during which a German frigate enforcing an arms blockade against Libya intercepted and searched a Turkish freighter. Turkey said on Monday that personnel from the German frigate Hamburg were flown by helicopter aboard the Turkish vessel Rosaline-A on Sunday off the coast of Libya. They conducted an hours-long search which Turkey dismissed as “illegal under international laws." Germany's Defense Ministry said Turkey ordered a halt to the search which forced the German team to depart before completing their work. The ministry said that during the search, the team had found no cargo that was in violation of the weapons embargo.

"My parents had a much different experience in the 80s when they were looking for a home in Montecito, CA, a suburb of Santa Barbara. My mother toured houses without my dad because she learned she had a better chance of her offer being accepted as a white woman than as part of a biracial couple. One seller even took her home off the market to avoid selling to my parents after seeing my Black father. Although my family is just one example and racism in housing still exists, the country has made progress in just one generation."

Lake Arbutus is a manmade vacation mecca in Hatfield that traces its origins to 1904, when the La Crosse Water Power Co. dammed the Black River to create a hydroelectric plant.
 Located partly in Jackson County and partly in Clark County, the reservoir of more than 800 acres harbors three parks along its shores, as well as numerous cabins and homes — some seasonal; some year-round.
 “Hatfield is well known for having a sign that lists the population as summer, 5,000, and winter, 50,” said Torger Mikkelson of Waunakee, who has had a cabin there for 60 years.
 “Somebody sawed it off, so we’ve got to get a new one,” said Mikkelson, a member of the Lake Arbutus Association and editor of the group’s newsletter.
 The 200-member association of residents around and near the lake has taken a major role in enhancing water quality and making improvements to Arbutus, said Jon Schweitzer, assistant administrator of the Jackson County Forestry and Parks Department.
 “They have done a lot of good work,” Schweitzer said.
 That work has included donating two “gumby suits,” which are insulated, buoyant suits for water rescues, to the fire department in case someone breaks through the ice during the winter. The association also created three “Kids Don’t Float” kiosks on the lake so boaters who have forgotten life jackets for their children can borrow them and return them at the end of the day, Mikkelson said.
 With a maximum depth of 50 feet and a mean depth of 16 feet, the lake is a popular boating, skiing and fishing venue.
 Jackson County has two campgrounds — East Arbutus and West Arbutus — and camping also is available at Clark County’s Russell Memorial Park.
 The lake is almost as big of a draw during the winter as in the summer, Mikkelson said, with hundreds of snowmobilers and ATV riders taking to the state trails.
 The hydroelectric dam, still churns out current for North American Hydro in Neshkoro, Wis., which has been a subsidiary of Eagle Creek Renewable Energy in Morristown, N.J., since 2012.

Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy has warned of an “irrecoverable loss of income” if grounds remain closed to fans after the club posted a £63.9million loss for the year ending June 30.
 The figures stand in stark contrast to the £68.6m profit for the preceding 12 months, and come amid a coronavirus pandemic which Levy conceded “could not have come at a worse time” for the clubs.
 Reduced Champions League receipts, shortfalls in matchday and media revenues related to the pandemic, and an increase in operational costs by more than £40m all contributed to the deficit.
 We are currently in the midst of one of the most challenging times ever experienced. The impact of the pandemic on our revenue is material and could not have come at a worse time
 Levy said: “We are currently in the midst of one of the most challenging times ever experienced.
 “The impact of the pandemic on our revenue is material and could not have come at a worse time, having just completed a £1.2bn stadium build which is financed by Club resources and long-term debt.
 “The 2020/21 season has so far seen no fans at games and this is compounded by a loss of third party events such as NFL, concerts, the closure of stores and visitor attractions.
 Tottenham Hotspur v Manchester City – Premier League – Tottenham Hotspur Stadium (PA Wire)
 “Our estimate for the current financial year of the potential loss of revenue, should the stadium remain closed to fans, is in excess of £150m. Clearly this would be an irrecoverable loss of income.”
 Despite the move behind closed doors, Spurs reported an increase in matchday and catering receipts to £81.9m, compared to £64.2m in the previous year, when the majority of the club’s matches were staged at Wembley.
 Levy reiterated his belief that Tottenham, in common with their Premier League rivals, are equipped to enable the safe return of spectators as soon as government rules allow.
 “We have spent the past months preparing our stadium, testing our digital ticketing process and registering ID validation for fans,” added Levy.
 “Premier League clubs are entirely capable, similar to the experience in several other countries, of responsibly delivering outdoor events with social distancing, exemplary hygiene standards, qualified stewards, testing capabilities and diverse travel plans, operating in some of the most technologically advanced venues in the world.
 “We recognise that health and safety are paramount and we have been encouraged by the latest news on vaccine developments and potential Clinical Passports.”

Pigg's spell was the icing on the cake for the GDSC 2nd Grade competition leaders who were already well on track for victory thanks to a brilliant spell of 3 for 11 of 8 from skipper Billy Blanch. Earlier Jaye Yardy (41 off 50) continued to show his reliability at the top of the order while Jake Chevalley (44 off 23) continued to take his hitting game to a new level. Michael Monckton (24 off 18) and Damien Moran (20 off 9) also delivered blistering cameos, and Tucabia could have posted an even greater total but ran out of wickets with eight overs still in the bank.

That's an all-too-common concern. While some larger players, such as Amazon or the big grocery chains, are likely to weather this new round of restrictions, it's a far less certain path for smaller businesses, many which were already barely hanging on.
 Even before the new restrictions had been announced, industry estimates suggested that 35% of the state’s restaurants and 49% of the state’s hotels will permanently close due to the pandemic, the Washington Hospitality Association (WHA) said. Grim forecasts also await many smaller retailers as well as businesses, such as gyms, that must close entirely during the governor's restrictions.
 Those scenarios would be playing out with only a fraction of the government aid provided to businesses and their workers last spring.
 Congress hasn't extended its earlier program of small business loans and enhanced unemployment. On Friday, Gov. Inslee proposed a relief package worth $135 million as well as cuts in businesses' unemployment tax — but that's dwarfed by what the state's business community faces in total lost revenue.
 Other relief is also drying up. The first lockdown saw private philanthropic efforts supplement public aid. But as the 10th month of the pandemic approaches, some of those initiatives have wound down or focused their efforts on a smaller subset of businesses.
 "Donor fatigue is real," said Lillian Sherman, the executive director of the Pike Place Market Foundation, which has given nearly $500,000 to market businesses to help them roll out new products and transition to delivery.
