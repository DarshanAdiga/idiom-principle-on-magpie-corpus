One moment, photographer Andres Martinez Casares was out on the streets of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, dodging teargas canisters as crowds called for the resignation of President Jovenel Moise and his government.
 The next, he was in Beirut which was packed with protesters chanting for the political elite to be ousted. Journalists have to live with sharp transitions as they move from story to story. Martinez Casares had to travel 10,500 km (6,500 miles), in just over a day, from the unrest in the heart of the Caribbean to mass protests in the Middle East.
 The photographer - who had been working in Haiti since 2010 - had been asked to fly from Port-au-Prince to Guadeloupe to Paris and then Beirut to join the local team who had been covering the Lebanese demonstrations for weeks. Reuters has a string of international bureaus well placed to report on developments on their patch, but on particularly long-running stories, they welcome reinforcements.
 "Part of the job is to be a quick responder," said the 37-year-old from Leon, Spain. "On my first day in a new place, I always like to be with somebody who is familiar with the situation and can help me to understand it on the ground."
 Picture editors Cynthia Karam and Maria Semerdjian brought him up to speed on the latest developments in Beirut and showed him the main locations. RULES OF ENGAGEMENT
 From then on it was a question of following an adaptable set of rules of engagement - wearing the right protective gear, checking for exit routes, watching the behaviour of security forces and protesters. "I've always tried to work with somebody that I can trust, a motorcycle taxi driver in Haiti, for example, or other colleagues - keeping an eye on them and vice versa in case there is a problem so we can assist each other.
 "And when I‚Äôm taking pictures, it's about being respectful, responsible and accurate, not exaggerating or minimizing, and being honest and fair." It's also about telling the story of individuals caught up in political unrest.
 The last pictures he took in Haiti showed members of the national cycle team training in the backstreets as the protests raged around them. Among the first he took in Lebanon showed life in the street camps that sprang up during the demonstrations - women chatting on the roof of an abandoned cinema, tents in a downtown square.
 Three weeks on, those protests had died down in Beirut. But just over 13,500 km southwest on another continent, thousands more people were heading out on the streets, many of them calling for the resignation of their own president. Martinez Casares got on another plane, heading for Santiago, Chile. (Editing by Andrew Heavens)

Investing and corporate governance overhauls pushed by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe have forced Japanese companies to finally take notice of their shareholders ‚Äî and empowered investors to speak up more.
 Shareholders made proposals at the annual general meetings of a record 54 companies in June 2019, an increase of 35 percent compared to 2018, according to IR Japan Holdings Ltd. data. The shareholder pressure on companies to boost profitability and capital efficiency will likely push them to dispose of noncore holdings and seek out acquisitions that complement their main businesses, bankers say.
 Last year, vocal shareholders had varying degrees of success. Marathon Asset Management protested the surprise ousting of the chief executive of toilet- maker Lixil Group Corp. and ultimately helped reinstate him. But American activist investor Dan Loeb was rebuffed in his attempt to shake things up at Sony Corp. last summer, when the company snubbed his proposal to sell off its semiconductor and financial services operations.

Jones, Ellis N. Jr. GRAFTON Ellis N. Jones, Jr. entered eternal rest on Monday, December 16, 2019, after a brief illness. He was 87 years old and lived independently in his home. He was predeceased by his parents, Ellis N. Jones, Sr. and Minnie M. (Haviland) Jones of East Greenbush; his sister Gertrude E. Jones Longdove of Argyle; and his beloved companion of over 40 years Phyllis A. Collins. Ellis is survived by his sisters, Harriet Spiezio of Greenwich, Shirley Jones of Hoosick Falls; and his six children, Darcy (David) M. Nutter of Arlington, Vt., Faye (Ron) A. Wagar of Schenectady, Terri L. Marpe of Hoosick Falls, Ellis (Lynn) N. Jones, III of Buskirk, Eric N. Jones of Buskirk and Judith J. Gross of Johnsonville. He was a proud grandfather of over 30 grandchildren, great-grandchildren; and one great- great-grandson. Ellis entered the Navy upon graduating Hoosick Falls High School in 1951 and was a veteran of the Korean War . He retired from Niagra Mohawk after a 36 year career. He was a honorary member of the Forever Blue Future Farmers of America. He was an avid outdoorsman and a jack of all trades. Extremely skilled in many facets, he took great pride in maintaining and repairing not only his own home, but those of his family and friends as well. A man of constant motion, his interests and hobbies included but certainly not limited to hunting, fishing, maple sugaring, stamp and coin collecting, canonry, camping, model railroading and four-wheeling. His mind was always engaged, and he embarked on many new journeys and adventures even in his advanced years. A lifelong animal lover, he was devoted to spoiling his pets beyond reason. Ellis's strong proud character was tempered by his kind nature, extreme generosity, quick wit, and keen sense of humor. He loved and cared for everyone who was fortunate enough to be part of his life and will be missed beyond measure. A private military service will be held in the spring.

While he is optimistic, evangelical leader and Trump confidant Jerry Falwell Jr., the president of Liberty University, said it's too early to predict a Trump electoral landslide. But he's calling on all Republicans to embrace the Trump playbook.
 "He's teaching Republicans a lesson that I hope they learn ‚Äî that nobody's going to support them if they continue to be so diplomatic and so, what's the word I'm looking for? I mean they act like royalty, like it's beneath them to get down in the mud and fight," Falwell said in an interview. "The people have been looking for somebody who will get down in the mud and fight and wade in up to their waist. Trump's the first one who's the done that."
 Indeed, Trump has eagerly attacked anyone and everyone who has criticized his personal style or governing decisions, even members of his own administration at times. He has already used ethnic slurs to go after Warren, raised questions about Sanders' age, falsely called his rivals socialists, and openly encouraged foreign governments ‚Äî namely Ukraine and China ‚Äî to dig up dirt on Biden.
 As his political base cheers, such tactics threaten to inflict lasting damage on Trump's standing with some voters ‚Äî especially women.
 Democrats scored sweeping victories in the 2018 and 2019 as college-educated women, particularly in America's suburbs, turned their backs on Trump's GOP. At the same time, there is evidence that younger voters and minorities are both energized and repelled by Trump entering the new year.
 Bannon insisted the GOP has become the "working-class party" under Trump, although he has some concern about Trump's standing with working-class women. His more serious concern, however, lies with the narrow, but vocal slice of establishment-minded Republicans who are fighting his reelection.
 He referenced the recent birth of an anti-Trump group dubbed the Lincoln Project, led by veteran Republican strategists who are planning a nationwide campaign to convince disaffected Republicans and independent voters to vote Democrat. The group's leadership features conservative attorney George Conway, who is the husband of Trump's chief White House counselor Kellyanne Conway.
 "We need the Republican establishment on board," Bannon said, noting that Trump essentially won the presidency because of less than 80,000 combined votes across Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin ‚Äî "an inside straight," he called it.
 "If these guys can peel off 3% or 4%, that's going to be serious," he said of Trump's Republican rivals.
 Yet for all the talk of shifting voting blocs, intra-party fights and what will almost certainly be the most expensive campaign in the history of the world, Bannon believes that Trump's fate will ultimately be decided by one man.
 "Only Trump can beat Trump," he said.

Earlier in the month, De Mangeleer and his sous chef, Jef Poppe, also collaborated with French restaurants Florilege and Anis in Tokyo. But they saved the most elaborate collaboration for their final stop at Rakushin, simultaneously preparing both lunch and dinner services in Rakushin's compact kitchen.
 One dish that embodies their collaborative philosophy is the broiled _shirako_ (milt) topped with strands of gossamer-thin turnip shavings to which De Mangeleer adds a sauce of hazelnut butter and capers. It's a dish with subtle textures and bold flavors, one that well-represents the personalities that went into creating it. Another is the beetroot, salmon roe and caviar served in a dill and cream sauce.
 On the face of it, the two are very different chefs. Katayama and his team could pass for salarymen, if it weren't for their chef's whites and geta. In contrast, De Mangeleer is outfitted in a dark leather apron, sporting numerous bracelets and pendants for that rockstar-chef look.
 "What's most important, though, is the (overall) harmony that's created," Katayama says. "It's not just about the food, it's also about the atmosphere and theme of what we are doing. Above all it's about the people gathered here."

WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî President Donald Trump insists that Iranian cultural sites are fair game for the U.S. military, dismissing concerns within his own administration that doing so could constitute a war crime under international law. He also warned Iraq that he would levy punishing sanctions if it expelled American troops in retaliation for a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad that killed a top Iranian official.
 But Congress is pushing back, in what's expected to be a pivotal week as lawmakers return from a holiday recess. On Monday, two top Senate Democrats called on Trump to immediately declassify the administration's reasoning for the strike on the Iranian official, Gen. Qassem Soleimani, saying there is "no legitimate justification" for keeping the information from the public.
 And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said late Sunday the House would introduce and vote this week on a war powers resolution to limit the president's military actions regarding Iran. In a letter to House Democrats, Pelosi called the airstrike "provocative and disproportionate" and said it had "endangered our servicemembers, diplomats and others by risking a serious escalation of tensions with Iran." A similar resolution was introduced in the Senate.

Always prepared for competition, he loved skipping rocks, throwing frisbees, hitting targets, and being the loudest supporter at sporting events. Papa Dick was the best judge of a firm handshake. Moving to Perrysburg in 2009 started a new phase of life for Papa Dick. Much to his delight Ann Nicholson, his sweetie pie, became his wife in 2013, fully embracing her life and family as his own. Brad (Michelle) Nicholson, Lindsay (Jameson) Czech and their three children Harrison, Johanna and Anderson will miss him deeply. Dick's survivors include his wife, Ann Evans; children Kim (Alan) Henderson, Jen Midkiff, Kyle (Nicole) Evans and grandchildren, Nichole Henderson, Matt Henderson, Taylor Midkiff, Caden Midkiff, Landon Evans and Maebel Evans.

George Albert Lincoln, Jr., 80, longtime resident of Hudson, MA and more recently Nottingham Village, Northumberland, PA passed away peacefully surrounded by family on Tuesday, December 24, 2019. George was born in Arlington, MA on May 17, 1939, a son of the late George Albert Sr. and Florence (Fawcett) Lncoln. He married the former Jill Moore, and his death breaks a marital union of 56 years. George was a 1957 graduate of Arlington High, a Navy veteran, and a graduate of Newbury Junior College with a degree in Business Management. In 1962 he began a 34-year career at MIT Lincoln Laboratory in engineering. He worked on important government-sponsored programs including research and development for the space program. This included improving the processes and development of semiconductors utilizing technologies such as Ion Beam Assisted Etching and Gallium Arsenide. Some of his 30 publications are to this day the most frequently cited. After retiring at 56, he and Jill traveled frequently, splitting their time between Cape Cod and Fort Myers, FL. George's true passion was time with family. He was amazingly devoted to Jill, and as her primary care provider, his devotion was breath-taking. He was alw- ays there for his family | serving as his sons first hockey coach, present for every activity, quick to praise and celebrate every achievement, and provide wise counsel when advice was helpful. More than a great dad, he was a lifelong close friend. At the age of 60 he joined the Coast Guard Auxiliary and frequently patrolled the coast of Cape Cod. He also volunteered with Head Start, enjoyed woodworking, cooking, hunting, fishing, golf, and square dancing. He is survived by his wife Jill; one brother, William Fawcett Lincoln; one son, George; daughter-in-law, Kathleen; grandchildren, Matthew and Melissa; nephews, Jonathan and Josh; and nieces, Christine, Holly, Jenni, and Heather. He was preceded in death by two sons, Shane Michael and Gary Andrew Lincoln; and one brother, David Peter Lincoln. In lieu of flowers, please consider a memorial donation to

Martinez Casares had to travel 10,500 km 6,500 miles, in just over a day, from the unrest in the heart of the Caribbean to mass protests in the Middle East.The photographer - who had been working in Haiti since 2010 - had been asked to fly from Port-au-Prince to Guadeloupe to Paris and then Beirut to join the local team who had been covering the Lebanese demonstrations for weeks. Reuters has a string of international bureaus well placed to report on developments on their patch, but on particularly long-running stories, they welcome reinforcements.Part of the job is to be a quick responder, said the 37-year-old from Leon, Spain. On my first day in a new place, I always like to be with somebody who is familiar with the situation and can help me to understand it on the ground.Picture editors Cynthia Karam and Maria Semerdjian brought him up to speed on the latest developments in Beirut and showed him the main locations. RULES OF ENGAGEMENTFrom then on it was a question of following an adaptable set of rules of engagement - wearing the right protective gear, checking for exit routes, watching the behaviour of security forces and protesters. Ive always tried to work with somebody that I can trust, a motorcycle taxi driver in Haiti, for example, or other colleagues - keeping an eye on them and vice versa in case there is a problem so we can assist each other.And when Im taking pictures, its about being respectful, responsible and accurate, not exaggerating or minimizing, and being honest and fair. Its also about telling the story of individuals caught up in political unrest.The last pictures he took in Haiti showed members of the national cycle team training in the backstreets as the protests raged around them. Among the first he took in Lebanon showed life in the street camps that sprang up during the demonstrations - women chatting on the roof of an abandoned cinema, tents in a downtown square.Three weeks on, those protests had died down in Beirut. But just over 13,500 km southwest on another continent, thousands more people were heading out on the streets, many of them calling for the resignation of their own president. Martinez Casares got on another plane, heading for Santiago, Chile. Editing by Andrew Heavens

The shop's managing director, Gillian Kennedy, said they had tried to "fight on" despite increasingly difficult trading conditions.
 She told BBC News NI: "A lot of our customers say they don't really come into Belfast any more, between the price of parking and the one-way system and bus lanes, it is just not enjoyable.
 "Online is, also, too convenient for people, we can't compete with the online giants.
 "We knew this would be on the cards for the past year or so. We are all very much a family and it has hit everybody hard. It is a very difficult time."
 There has been significant reaction to the news from customers of the shop, which specialises in arts and crafts supplies.
 One customer posted on Facebook that she travelled from Dublin to get stock or attend demonstrations at Craftworld and was sad to see the news.
 "I can't believe I am reading your news. I can only imagine how hard this decision was to make," wrote another.

The complicated structure of many Japanese conglomerates has long baffled foreign investors, with publicly traded parent companies and their networks of listed units ‚Äî so-called parent-child listings ‚Äî coming in for particular criticism. But driven by corporate governance changes that have boosted outside voices on boards, as well as a forthcoming overhaul of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, many are starting to rein in or divest their listed units.
 In 2019, Honda Motor Co. and Hitachi Ltd. agreed to merge four car parts businesses into one conglomerate supplier, while Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corp. offered $4.5 billion to buy out the rest of drugmaker Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corp. Hitachi and Toshiba also took steps to consolidate or divest multiple listed units under their control.
 Tokyo investors are now speculating that Sony, Fujitsu Ltd. and NEC Corp. will be next to tidy up their listed portfolios in 2020.
