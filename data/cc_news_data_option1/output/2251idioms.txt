A mother, who captured a video of another woman verbally attacking her and her daughter during a Black Lives Matter protest last weekend, said Tuesday there's "a lot of cracks" in the woman's apology.
 Erika Baze and her 8-year-old daughter participated in a Friday protest in northwest Bakersfield. Baze said she'd attended daily protests up to that point, and her daughter wanted to come along. Because she heard the northwest Bakersfield protest was peaceful, Baze decided to take her daughter during the day.
 "(My daughter) was first looking around, holding up her sign, then she was raising her sign higher, and then she started to chant and get louder," Baze said. "She was enjoying it."
 The two decided to head home before it got dark, and when walking through a neighborhood, Baze said the woman, identified as Carrie Maxwell, reportedly a Bakersfield City School District teacher, told them they "needed to leave" and "had no business to be there." At that point, the two weren't holding up signs or chanting, Baze said.
 Baze noticed Maxwell was recording her daughter and "getting closer and more aggressive," so Baze decided to pull out her phone and record Maxwell.
 In the now widely shared video on social media, Maxwell says, “I’ll (expletive) kill you,” toward the mother before a shirtless man takes her away. Baze's daughter is heard crying and saying, "I'm scared."
 Her daughter is doing OK now, Baze said.
 She said she called the Bakersfield Police Department to file a report after returning home. Police spokesman Sgt. Nathan McCauley said Monday that the BPD is investigating the incident.
 The Bakersfield City School District also said Monday it was conducting an investigation into the incident.
 Maxwell released a statement Monday through her lawyer, Kyle J. Humphrey, offering "my sincerest apology to anyone who was hurt by my behavior ...," adding the video was a "captured moment of my anxiety, frustration, and panic for the safety of my family."
 Baze didn't think Maxwell's full statement was an apology, but rather a news release.
 "If you analyze the words, she doesn’t apologize to me or my daughter. She apologizes 'to anyone who was hurt by my behavior in that video' and that’s the only word of apology in the statement," Baze said. She added she didn't receive a copy of the apology.
 Maxwell saying she "never intended to cause fear" also made Baze pause, since Maxwell threatened to kill her, the video shows.
 Baze said her daughter doesn't want to go back to a protest for the time being.

Son varios los factores que llevan a esto. Por un lado, la delicada situacion economica local que tendera a agravarse como consecuencia de la prolongada cuarentena. Si bien el coronavirus golpeo a todos los paises, los problemas que traia de arrastre la Argentina suponen una caida mayor al resto y una recuperacion mas lenta. "La decision de emigrar no es sencilla, pero hoy encontramos mas disposicion a hacerlo. Sin duda esta creciendo desde el año pasado la tendencia a posicionarse en el exterior. Recientemente tuvimos un caso de una busqueda en Sudamerica en la que uno de los candidatos la rechazo pero un par de meses despues llamo para saber si todavia estaba activa. A esto se suma que la Argentina lamentablemente presenta cada vez menos oportunidades de crecimiento, a medida que las empresas multinacionales mueven sus roles regionales y la toma de decisiones hacia otros paises. Vamos perdiendo relevancia", comentaron en otra consultora de primer nivel en la que prefirieron la reserva.
 El "efecto default" es otro ingrediente clave que se maneja en el mundo empresario porque imagina un escenario de ajuste empresario mas que de expansion. De hecho muchos ejecutivos no saben si podran mantener sus puestos si no se detiene el derrumbe. "Hay una tendencia de mayor demanda de ejecutivos argentinos. No solo de residentes en el pais sino tambien los que estan en el exterior porque tienen una flexibilidad para adaptarse a otras culturas. Los argentinos que residen afuera tienen una vision de la realidad argentina bastante mas negativa que la que tenemos los que vivimos aqui. En parte porque tienen un punto de referencia de economias mas estables y racionales. Pero quizas otra parte de la ecuacion es que nosotros nos hemos ido acostumbrando a una situacion poco 'normal'", explico Pablo Taussig, consultor y socio de Spencer Stuart Argentina.
 Las cuestiones politicas tambien son un punto a tener en cuenta a la hora de decidir dejar el pais. Pero tambien juegan a favor los niveles de ingresos. En un pais ultra devaluado, los salarios de posiciones de primer nivel (salvo excepciones aclaradas previamente o las participaciones accionarias) tambien se deterioran medidos en dolares ya que se pactan en pesos. En el mundillo del personal jerarquico suelen pensar en "verde", por lo que la comparacion con otros paises se hace en esa moneda. En ese contraste, los ingresos en cargos similares pueden estar hoy entre 30% y 50% que en paises vecinos
 Si bien los destinos mas codiciados son Estados Unidos o Europa, especialmente España, tambien son los mas dificiles. Por eso la region va ganando terreno. Chile y Brasil son, tradicionalmente, los preferidos aunque Uruguay surge hoy como una alternativa importante. "Es un lugar que cada vez es mas atractivo por su cercania, la estabilidad economica e ingresos superiores. Trabajamos con empresas extranjeras que estan haciendo busquedas y notamos que crece la cantidad de ejecutivos argentinos que lo tienen como una opcion real", agrego Scagliotti.

Antonio Caperna   MILANO - Riorganizzazione delle attività, messa in atto di procedure preventive COVID-free, copertura dei turni e della continuità assistenziale, utilizzo delle nuove tecnologie per teleconsulto e telelavoro. I Dipartimenti di radioterapia oncologica italiani hanno risposto rapidamente ed efficacemente all'emergenza sanitaria da COVID-19, continuando ad effettuare, seppur tra molte difficoltà, i trattamenti per i pazienti ad elevata priorità oncologica, gestendo bene il compromesso tra rischio di infezione e necessità di cura.   È quanto emerge da un'indagine su oltre cento Servizi di Radioterapia, promossa dall'Associazione Italiana di Radioterapia e Oncologia Clinica (AIRO), coordinata dal prof. Vittorio Donato, Presidente AIRO e dalla prof.ssa Barbara Jereczek-Fossa, Direttore della Divisione di Radioterapia dell'Istituto Europeo di Oncologia di Milano. Lo studio è in pubblicazione su Radiotherapy & Oncology'.   Secondo i dati è stata mantenuta in 2 radioterapie su 3 l'attività clinica pre-coronavirus: la riduzione delle prestazioni è risultata inferiore al 10% nel 32% delle radioterapie e tra il 10% e il 30% nel 30,4% delle strutture. In media, per 9 centri su 10 l'effettiva riduzione è stata molto inferiore al 30%. È aumentata l'attività dei regimi ipofrazionati (73%) nei centri che trattano più di 500 pazienti all'anno, per consentire ai pazienti soste brevi in ospedale e minori accessi possibili. Inoltre, per tutelare la continuità terapeutico-assistenziale è stata attivata la consultazione telematica (63%). Sono state adottate misure preventive molto accurate sia per salvaguardare il personale alla macchina sia gli operatori sanitari con sale COVID-free e triage pre-ingresso in ospedale e nelle sale di radioterapia per garantire la necessaria sicurezza ai pazienti oncologici.   «L'indagine è una fotografia reale di quanto accaduto in questi mesi di emergenza in tutta Italia. I 125 centri che hanno risposto sono distribuiti nel Paese con una rappresentanza lombarda del 20% dichiara il prof. Donato I reparti radioterapici non solo hanno protetto i loro pazienti e il personale ma con uno sforzo immenso hanno continuato a erogare prestazioni salvavita ai malati in trattamento e con malattia attiva. L'utilizzo del teleconsulto è stato di grande utilità come metodica alternativa a distanza ai controlli e al follow up face to face.   leggocaperna@gmail.com

Sue, the oldest of six, was raised in Wheat Ridge, Colorado. Her greatest childhood memories were spending time with her Italian grandmother, Sarah Gioia, making spaghetti sauce and homemade pasta and riding with her grandfather, Nick Gioia, delivering fresh produce to homes in Denver. By the early age of eight, she was helping her father with his homebuilding business. This is where her love for real estate and sales began. During her 40+ year career in real estate sales, marketing, management and training, she received four Home Builders Association MAME (Marketing and Merchandising Excellence) awards, three National Association of Homebuilder awards and inclusion in the International Who’s Who Historical Society list. For Sue, the accolades were nice, but that wasn’t what drove her. It was helping others succeed that made it all worth it to her, and many considered her a “Life Coach”. Even when she became diagnosed with Wet Macular Degeneration (WMD) in 2017, which impeded her ability to see the smiles of her family and friends, she never let on about the challenges with her vision.
 In 1993, while working in Colorado Springs, she met her soulmate, Dean Wieseler. Their relationship started with dinner and a game of cribbage after work. She was also a card shark as Dean would soon find out. They were married September 15th, 2006 in Colorado Springs. Sue also knew family was also very important to Dean, so after semi-retiring in 2008, they moved to their lake house in Crofton, Nebraska to be closer to Dean’s family. She was welcomed with open arms and continued to spread her love. In September of 2011, Sue and Dean exchanged their vow’s again at Immaculate Conception Catholic Church in Saint Helena, Nebraska with Father Ross Buckhalter and Father Eric Olsen officiating. She and Dean made frequent trips to Denver to spend time with her wonderful family and friends. She loved being a grandma and great-grandma (GG) and their visits were always full of love, joy and, of course, games and cards. Many tears of laughter were shed. She also enjoyed traveling, especially road trips with Dean, and visiting the many people she met over her training career across the country.
 Sue is survived by her husband, Dean Wieseler of Crofton, NE; two children, Steve Miller of Lakewood, CO, Tina Miller of Lakewood, CO; two grandchildren, two great-grandchildren, five siblings, many sisters and brothers- in-law, and numerous cousins, nieces and nephews.

Third, from a regulatory point of view: it is the strength of the EU “food system” that it treats food as a tradeable commodity embedded into harmonized EU standards, including sustainability. Changing the approach from consumer preference to “ _food as a common good_ ” with a view to realise only one out of many conflicting regulatory goals risks triggering unwanted side-effects. Realising one single predefined regulatory purpose such as sustainability had been exercised in the past with a view to enforce safety of products in the EU.[1] It had resulted in major drawbacks to the European integration project. As the EU is characterised by different socio-economic settings, disconnecting food from the diversity of consumer preferences and business requirements risks resulting in the creation of uniform “Eurofoods”, which satisfies the requirements of only a few consumers and businesses at the expense of others.[2] A standard example had been the discussion around the introduction of an EU-wide prohibition of cheese made from non-pasteurized milk.[3] While justified by sound scientific reasons, it would have only impacted mainly small Southern cheese manufactures in Europe to the benefit of Northern cheese producers. It would had also deprived consumers who had have been enjoying these kinds of cheese for centuries, and who may want to eat these cheeses in full knowledge of the potential health effects. Ultimately, it risks to impose one food standard on EU citizens and risks levelling the rich cultural diversity of food in the EU, a major characteristic of Europe.

Second, from a legal point of view: the application of the majority of regulations concerning foods in the EU are based on the provision of the free movement of goods. In other words, all regulations concerning the trade in foods, including those concerning the environment, sustainability, consumer protection and others require foods to be characterised as a commodity, or a consumer good. Deviating from this, as the report suggests, risks resulting in a pyrrhic victory by disabling the tools that enable us to regulate food systems with a view on sustainability, health and environmental protection at EU level. For example, while the regulation of “health” in the EU is according to Art. 168 TFEU by default in most cases only possible for non-harmonising measures such as an action plan on child obesity, regulation of health as a by-product of trade in goods, such as healthy packaging requirements or maximum residue levels, can be realised in the EU at any level of harmonisation.

Sinclair Broadcast Group could end up yanking 30 stations off of Comcast because of an ongoing battle over retransmission consent - leaving some 3 million customers without their broadcast signal.
 Sinclair's carriage deal with Comcast is up Feb. 5 and the broadcaster is demanding cash from the cable operator to carry its stations in 23 markets. Comcast, the nation's biggest cable operator, is refusing to pay cash and says Sinclair is the only broadcaster with which it can't reach a deal.      But in an interesting twist, many of its stations can't go black then due to a federal law that says no in-market station can be pulled from cable during a sweeps period.      By demanding cash, Sinclair becomes the latest broadcaster to assert its legal right to demand money in exchange for allowing the cable operator to retransmit their signal. Last month, fellow station owner Northwest Broadcasting Corp.
 pulled Fox stations
 on Time Warner Cable in three states because the two couldn't reach an agreement.      So far, stations have accepted advertising time from major cable operators or carriage of sister cable networks and have only gotten cash from satellite and small cable operators. Kagan Research projects that station owners stand to collect some $225 million in retransmission fees this year from cable and satellite operators and telcos, and $1 billion in 2009, the year some station owners’ cable deals, notably CBS, come due then.      The cable operators have historically said that they do not want to pay cash because they do not want to create higher bills for their customers, bills already getting hammered by the FCC as too high. Comcast would not say how much Sinclair was seeking and Sinclair did not return calls at press time.      In a statement, Comcast Corporation Executive Vice President David Cohen said: "Sinclair Broadcast Group, one of the nation’s largest broadcast television station owners, has demanded large cash payments from Comcast, and ultimately consumers, so that these customers can continue to view broadcast television stations that are available over-the-air for free. We do not believe that our customers should have to pay extra to watch free TV.      "We are currently negotiating with Sinclair to reach a fair agreement, but are not legally allowed to carry these channels without Sinclair’s permission. We will do everything in our power to avoid service interruptions without adding Sinclair’s proposed fees to customers’ bills."      Sinclair, which owns mostly Fox and MyNetworkTV stations, has had
 similar battles
 with Time Warner and Mediacom. Time Warners rights to carry the Sinclair' station in Buffalo was up Dec. 31, according to Sinclair, but was extended until Jan. 12 when an agreement couldn't be reached, according to a Time Warner spokesperson. And Sinclair's contentious retransmission dispute with Mediacom - with Sinclair scheduled to pull 22 stations Jan. 5 - resulted in the cable operator filing a complaint
 with the FCC
 .      In a similar standoff, Nexstar pulled its stations off cable systems in four small markets in December 2004 after the operators refused to pay the 30¢ per subscriber rate Nexstar was seeking. Most of the disputes have been resolved, and Nexstar says the majority of cable operators are paying cash (however, CableOne and Cox, two of the biggest operators Nexstar fought, are not).   Nexstar says retransmission payments will go from almost zero to some 15% of the company’s cash flow over the next five years

It was crazy. I feel like I had a first moment of like an epiphany of, "Wow! I'm actually going to play a superhero". That was always my dream as an actor, to be a superhero. So just when it all came together... Because it was a long process, I had to get scanned all over my body, I had to get those casts, those body casts, and I mean they were just working endlessly to try to perfect everything. And there's people who designed it on paper first and then they had to get me in just a regular black suit and then they were patching on the designs. Those triangular designs that go inward, they were patching those on, and it was a process. But once I finally put it on, it was a surreal moment of like, "Wow! This is going to be my life for the next six months, shooting the series". It was the best feeling in the world, I have to say.

I was pleasantly surprised to see some pics coming in today with a number of yellowfin tuna in them. Up until today tuna fishing had been pretty dreadfully slow. Mike Bromwell and his crew had one of the better tuna days when they scratched out 9 yellowfins on board the MARLI with Captain Mark Hoos and mates Dakota Bittner and Jon Robertson.

Just like the yellowfin tuna offshore, flounder made a little better appearance today in the back bays of Ocean City. The water was crystal clear north of the inlet and flounder love to eat in clean water. Captain John Prather of Ocean City Guide Service had two trips today and both produced keeper flounder for lucky anglers.

 Nationalised banks and cooperative banks had started levying interest for interest-free loans also and had begun collecting the interest from the borrowers.
 While the Central government had announced that additional credit to the tune of ₹30,000 crore would be pumped in through National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, the cooperative banks should waive all outstanding loans and stop collecting the interest for the moratorium period.
 ## ‘Non-performing assets’
 If the waiver was not possible, the Tamil Nadu government should ensure that the cooperative banks declared the outstanding loans as non-performing assets and disburse fresh loans to the farmers, Mr. Pandian urged.
 Drawing the attention of the government to the appalling financial condition of the cane cultivators who supplied sugarcane to Arignar Anna Sugar Mill at Kurunkulam in Thanjavur district, Mr. Pandian said the mill had not disbursed the amount due for the farmers for the year 2019-20 and, hence, the cane cultivators were unable to repay the loan taken by them for raising the crop.
 As a result, they were unable to avail fresh loans and were reeling under a severe financial crunch, he claimed.
 Alleging that agricultural operations in the State was all set to get affected as the COVID-19 virus had started spreading in villages in view of the relaxations of lockdown conditions, Mr. Pandian urged the State government to step up coronavirus tests in all districts.

"Obviously this has been a difficult semester, if you go all the way back to the last time we saw our players on the 6th of March when they took off to go on Spring Break and Spring Break hasn't really finished in a lot of ways," said Head Soccer Coach G Guerrieri. "We have been able to meet through virtual meetings and other interactions that were not real face-to-face meetings, but now we are able to get back in training, back in our facilities over at the Player Development Center, all of those things start to getting ourselves back to where we need to be. Now that we already have a third of the team back on campus, it is great to see them in person."
