For much of the next century, then, rapture theology was about escapism — creating a subculture with its own schools and rules and focus on personal salvation — and was concentrated in the South within fundamentalist communities, finding a home among those who rejected evolution and women’s lib and adhered to a strict, literal interpretation of the Bible. It wasn’t until about 50 years ago that the ideas started to take on an unhealthy political bent. The 1948 creation of the state of Israel meant that the end-times clock was ticking, and the founding of NATO and the U.N. foreshadowed the emergence of a New World Order run by liberal elites in cahoots with the Antichrist, who might be anyone from Gorbachev to Obama. The end-times Christian’s main calling had once been to save as many souls as possible before the rapture occurred, but after the advent of Jerry Falwell’s Moral Majority — a political crusade initiated by anger at the government for its attempts to desegregate private Christian schools — the mission became more overtly political and wrapped up in the idea that God would judge not just individuals, but also nations. As the world sunk further into depravity, a Christian’s charge was to push back against that depravity, to fight evil at every turn, and at every level of government.

 Düsseldorf (dpa/lnw) - Der nordrhein-westfälische SPD-Fraktionschef Thomas Kutschaty hat Ministerpräsident Armin Laschet (CDU) Führungsschwäche in der Corona-Krise vorgeworfen. Die schwarz-gelbe Landesregierung habe trotz früher Warnhinweise auf die Entwicklung zu viel Zeit verstreichen lassen statt zu handeln, sagte der Oppositionsführer am Freitag in einer Sondersitzung des Düsseldorfer Landtags zur Corona-Krise.
 \n
 Schon vor Wochen wäre es Aufgabe der Regierung gewesen, die Gesundheitsämter personell besser auszustatten und auf die zweite Infektionswelle vorzubereiten, unterstrich er. Stattdessen würden Tests in Kitas und Schulen schon wieder zurückgefahren und kostenlose Tests für Reiserückkehrer gestrichen. «Das ist genau das falsche Signal.».
 \n
 Schulministerin Yvonne Gebauer (FDP) habe nicht mehr anzubieten als Maskenpflicht, offene Fenster und den Rat, eine dicke Jacke anzuziehen. Nötig sei aber «ein Plan B» für eine noch dramatischere Entwicklung. Dazu gehörten kleinere Lerngruppen mit Schichtunterricht und Konzepte für digitalen Unterricht.
 \n
 Er forderte darüber hinaus eine stärkere Beteiligung des Parlaments und gesetzliche Entscheidungen statt «eine ständige High-Noon-Politik» mit Notverordnungen in letzter Sekunde.

Thank you, Stephanie. I'll try. Hello to WWE shareholders. Today, I'll review WWE's financial performance, liquidity and capital structure and business outlook. As a reminder, all comparisons are versus the year ago quarter, unless I say otherwise. WWE generated third quarter revenue of $221.6 million, up 19% and adjusted OIBDA of $84.3 million, up more than 2 times, both were driven primarily by higher rights fees from U.S. distribution agreements. Although government mandates continue to result in the cancellation of live events, WWE offset the absence of ticket sales with a reduction in event- related production expenses and other short-term cost savings.

The 15th Finance Commission (FC) will present its final report for the five fiscal years from 2021-22 to 2025-26 to the President on November 9, according to an official statement on Friday. The NK Singh-led commission completed its deliberations on Friday, which was the pre-appointed deadline, and sought time from President Ram Nath Kovind to submit the report, the statement said. A copy of the report will also be presented to the Prime Minister later next month while finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will table the report during the next session of Parliament along with an action taken report, it said. The commission finalised its recommendations after wide- ranging consultations with the Union, state and local governments at different tiers, its advisory committees, members of previous FCs and various domain experts, the statement said. With Singh as the chairman, members of the commission included AN Jha, former finance secretary, Ashok Lahiri, former chief economic adviser, Ramesh Chand, NITI Aayog member and Anoop Singh, former Asia and Pacific director at the International Monetary Fund. Traditionally, FCs have recommended the formula for tax devolution and grants to the states but the 15th FC was given the additional remit of coming up with a fiscal consolidation roadmap for general government. The 15th FC had submitted its interim report for FY21 in November last year. It had recommended a 41% share of taxes for the states with 1% going towards the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladhak. The 14th FC had awarded the states a 42% share. The commission had to adjust its plans on account of the Covid-19 pandemic that hit the Indian economy in March this year, rendering any previous assumptions of the economy untenable. In September, it was decided that the current fiscal be treated as a zero year and the commission should make its final recommendations for the coming five years till FY26. Singh had earlier indicated that an entire chapter within the report would be dedicated to the health sector given the added importance of the subject in light of the pandemic. The chairman had also mentioned that defence spending would be looked at through the perspective of the ongoing border tensions with China.

Going by current standings, RCB are better-placed at second place in the standings and they need to win one of their remaining two games  \-- against Sunrisers and Delhi -- to make the cut.      And even if RCB lose both their matches and stay on 14 points, they can still qualify but for that they need favourable results from other games.      However, RCB can ill afford to lose both their last two games as it will affect their net run rate, resulting in their elimination if other teams on 14 points have higher run rates.

Whether ISIS will seek greater clout over the Lake Chad insurgency in the future is unclear. Since 2018, when the last of the interviewed defectors left the group, some observers have claimed that ISIS is pushing for greater control of ISWAP.

There is even speculation that a recent round of internal tensions, which has resulted in the killing of major ISWAP figures, including Mamman Nur in 2018 and Ba Idrissa in 2020, had to do with ISIS wanting to clean house and exercise more direct authority.

Jennifer Lopez y Armie Hammer seran la pareja protagonista de Shotgun Wedding, una comedia romantica y de accion que dirigira Jason Moore (Pitch Perfect, 2012). Esta pelicula de Lionsgate contara entre sus productores con Lopez y tambien con otra estrella de maximo nivel en Hollywood como Ryan Reynolds. Shotgun Wedding relatara la historia de Darcy y Tom, una pareja que afronta su inminente boda con muchas dudas y con sus respectivas familias ayudando muy poco a relajar la situacion. Para complicar aun mas las cosas, la boda deja de ser una fiesta cuando todos los invitados sufren un intento de secuestro. El irresistible magnetismo de Jennifer y Armie, tanto separados como juntos, les hace la pareja perfecta para esta comedia de accion, aseguro hoy en un comunicado Erin Westerman, que es la presidenta de produccion de Lionsgate. Ambos son actores increiblemente divertidos que tambien cumplen en la accion, pero lo que diferencia a esta pelicula es la manera en la que su contagiosa quimica domina la pantalla. No puedes quitar los ojos de ellos, añadio. Mark Hammer y Liz Meriwether firmaran el guion de esta cinta. Tras arrasar entre la critica y el publico con Hustlers (2019) y deslumbrar al mundo junto a Shakira en el espectaculo de la Super Bowl de la NFL del pasado febrero, Lopez estrenara en 2021 en San Valentin la comedia romantica Marry Me junto a Maluma y Owen Wilson. En el futuro, la estrella hispana tambien tiene previsto meterse en la piel de la narcotraficante colombiana Griselda Blanco en la pelicula The Godmother. Por su parte, Hammer, que brillo junto a Timothee Chalamet en Call Me by Your Name (2017), acaba de presentar en Netflix y junto a Lily James una nueva version de Rebecca, la novela de Daphne du Maurier que ya habia sido adaptada en 1940 en la clasica cinta homonima de Alfred Hitchcock

 Since school returned on Aug. 6, there have been just 40 confirmed positive cases of COVID-19 among students and 24 positive cases among employees across the entire school system as of Tuesday morning, Superintendent Greg Faught said.
 He also said there has been an approximate 9 percent increase in the number of students who have returned to school from distance learning for the next nine weeks.
 “As many of you know, at the beginning of the school year we started with around 20 percent of our students staying at home for distance learning, and that number actually increased slightly after school started to just above 20 percent,” he said. “Currently, we have about 11 percent of our students at home for distance learning. Many of those students are doing very well, but we do have a few who are struggling in that area. We’re in close contact with those parents and students frequently and are encouraging them to allow us to help them at home or to get them back in school so we can help face to face.”

Leaders must now do a better job of bringing citizens on board with new restrictions. They must ensure that measures are proportionate and based on scientific advice, and that the public sector does its part to limit the spread of contagion — for example by reducing crowds on public transport. They must do better at communicating the thinking behind their decisions. Finally, they must put together adequate financial support and get it swiftly to those in need. During the first wave, countries such as Germany managed this far more efficiently than others such as Italy.

Euralarm, the European association of the fire safety and security industry, has commented on the upcoming delegated act (DA) for internet-connected and wearable radio equipment, as part of the Radio Equipment Directive. The comments and proposals are given in view of the activation of the delegated act pursuant to article 3(3) of the RED (d, e and f) and cover the scope of the delegated act, the definition of 'internet- connected devices' and the implementation period. Relevant technical aspects addressing cyber security While Euralarm supports the need for increased cyber security, the fire and security industry will preferably support a horizontal cyber security regulation. Nevertheless, if embedded in the RED, Euralarm wants to ensure that the technical aspects addressing cyber security are relevant for wireless fire safety and security equipment, and can work for manufacturers and service providers. The idea is to include the cyber security requirements through a delegated act on internet-connected and wearable radio equipment. Such an act is a legally binding act that enables the Commission to supplement or amend non‑essential parts of EU legislative acts, for example, to define detailed measures. Scope of DA limited to 'internet-connected devices' Euralarm believes that the scope of the DA should be limited to the 'consumer internet-connected devices' Since the essential requirements of the delegated act have been triggered by cases involving toys and other consumer devices, Euralarm believes that the scope of the DA (delegated act) should be limited to the 'consumer internet-connected devices'. Article 3(3) (d) of the RED states, "Radio equipment does not harm the network or its functioning, nor does it misuse network resources, so as to cause an unacceptable degradation of service." The term 'network' is not defined in the RED. Applying Art 3(3) (d) to internet-connected devices would create a deviating understanding of network, instead of radio communication network, it is enlarged to the 'internet'. Ensuring users' privacy and data security According to Euralarm, it is therefore, sufficient to enforce Art 3(3) (e) and (f) to ensure that personal data and privacy of the user and subscriber are protected, and that the equipment is protected from fraud. This will also reduce the risk of inconsistent and overlapping requirements. As far as the definition of 'internet-connected devices' is concerned, Euralarm believes that a clear definition is crucial for the correct application of this delegated act and that, therefore, the concept of 'directly or indirectly' shall be avoided. Defining 'consumer internet-connected device' Since 'internet' is not used nor is it defined in RED, Euralarm also proposes to re-formulate this definition to cover radio equipment connected by using any internet protocol. This specifically covers those devices that could potentially present cyber security risks. The definition of a consumer internet-connected device that Euralarm proposes is "Any radio equipment, falling within the scope of Directive 2014/53/EU, which is capable to be connected to internet by using any internet protocol and intended to be put into service by a consumer or any other end-user." Proposed transition period of five years As far as the date of application is concerned, Euralarm proposes a transition period of five years, before the requirements of the delegated act become mandatory. This allows enough time for a harmonised standard to become available and cited, and for manufacturers to finalise their product design and demonstrate the compliance.

For a thoroughbred fighter whose travails went far beyond the iron cages and blaring bluster, a violent sport has come as meditative succour. “At times, I do think of where I came from. All those childhood memories, all that violence…it is too hard to forget, but sport has given me hope. To see wards like Ritu develop and learn motivates me as a coach. Yes, it is challenging at times to build a new fighter from scratch and teach them a new discipline, but it is a beautiful process.” And so, the process, and Bahadurzadas fight for peace, go on.

Extensive testing was rolled out in Europe after the first wave, but too slowly and too late to avoid delays and bottlenecks. Contact tracers were too few; digital apps were left to wither on the vine. Positive cases didn’t take isolation seriously, because of a lack of enforcement and patchy financial support. These aren’t questions of philosophy, but about implementation of policy. Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, admitted as much on Thursday when she said European Union leaders should have acted sooner. Even the famously organized Germans failed to halt the second wave.

So I think we've all seen with Amazon, certainly an appetite for the NFL. We've also seen them sampling internationally, specifically with tennis in the U.K. It's certainly an indicator to me, if you look at some of their recent executive hires. We don't believe that you make those hires unless you're going to get more -- unless you're going to go deeper into the live business. If you look at Netflix's model, if, in fact, Disney is contemplating whatever they might be contemplating and NBC Universal, the same thing. If you're Netflix, you're sitting there saying, "Okay, we can continue to put out fresh content that registers, perhaps on a weekly basis, but we haven't yet tested live." So are they looking at testing live? Do they look to test it globally or internationally first, so they can make a few mistakes as it seems that Amazon did with tennis? They're all getting there, if they're not there already. So we're going to be there with them, again, with our current partners in mind first, but as the business continues to shift and Peacock becomes more of a priority for NBC Universal and with Fox's recent acquisition. Again, it's all going there. So yes, our anticipation is that the fangs, if they're not all there, the great majority of them are going to be there in the not-too-distant future in terms of live.
