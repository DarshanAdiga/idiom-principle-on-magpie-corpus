This International Day of Yoga, more and more studies and research discussing the many benefits of yoga are being published, especially it's benefits on mental health. Mental illness is not something new to this world, but in times of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing lockdown put in place to curb its spread, it has become grave. With people increasingly living isolated lives for the last three months, the situation is getting worse day by day. With millions of recorded cases and deaths, the infectious disease has seen a rise in depression, anxiety disorder, domestic violence and sexual abuse, with cases reported from across the country. According to research published online in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, affecting more than 340 million people. And depressive symptoms often go hand in hand with other mental health issues, such as generalised anxiety and psychotic disorders.A recent study concluded with a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing research suggests that yoga may help ease depressive symptoms in people with other mental health issues.While sharing his experience on Yoga, Sourabh Tiwari, Assistant Professor, Manipal University Jaipur told ANI, "I was never a Yoga person, but during the early days of lockdown I was frustrated and disturbed. I was not able to concentrate on work, I decided to start Yoga and morning walks. This getting up early in the morning and doing Yoga helped me a lot in achieving my mental peace.""Now, I find myself more energetic and relaxed. Yoga is something which has to be done regularly to learn its benefits. No one can actually predict the benefits of Yoga without experiencing it. On the International Yoga Day I request all youngsters to please try and see the benefit yourself," Tiwari further said.Kriti Raj, a post graduate student who has been practising Yoga for many years says that Yoga had helped her to remain calm, cool and positive. By doing Anulom vilom, Bhujangasana, Bhrastika and Kapalbhati yogasanas she felt a lot of improvement in her mental as well as physical health.Meanwhile, Priya Manish Kumar, an Assistant Professor from St. Xavier's College, Patna said that Yoga is magic! It helped her to balance her emotions."Yoga, I was told was not just for the body but also for the soul. I started practicing yoga to lose weight and was rewarded with myriad other health benefits. Yoga is magic! Other than keeping me physically fit, it helps me be calm and emotionally balanced. It gives me a lot of energy that keeps me productive throughout the day," she said.Dr Rajiv Mehta, Vice-Chairperson, Institute of Psychiatry and Behavioural Sciences, Sir Gangaram Hospital while talking to ANI about mental illness said, "Our body functions on chemicals. Emotions and behaviour also run on chemicals, when they get depleted, depression happens. The reason for the depletion occurs from the demands in the brain which can be addressed as any kind of change, be it positive or negative. So by yoga especially Pranayam and meditation--- it improves the chemical level in the brain as it is an oxygenating mechanism for the brain."Dr Mehta suggests for practising Yoga continuously to gain the maximum benefit from it, as it is slow and steady process. However, action starts soon after doing yoga and it can maintain or prevent a mental state but for improvement it takes days and months with Yoga.Due to the pandemic induced lockdown the number of patients has been increased who are suffering from major metal illness. "By one estimate approximately 10 per cent of the Indian population was suffering from major mental illness minor mental illness is apart but by the end of the COVID we expect it around to be 20 to 40 per cent," said Dr Mehta.Further elaborating about the reasons for increase numbers of patients Dr Mehta said, "Major mental illness like--depression, anxiety, drug addiction and hypochondriasis are increasing among people and the reasons for this increase is job insecurities , lack of payment in the job, lack of business, domestic violence, child abuse, and frustration not to go outside. Just like calcium deficiency leads to osteoporosis, thyroxin deficiency results in hypothyroidism, iron deficiency causes anaemia, serotonin deficiency reportedly leads to depression.Medical expert says to deal with anxiety and stress in this lockdown one should do various types of activities and should not make a monotonous routine of the day. People dealing with stress or depression should also communicate well with family and friends. International Yoga day is a wonderful concept; one should do time management and take time for Yoga and exerciseGarima Bhandari, an internationally acclaimed Yoga coach talking about the importance of Yoga said that, "Yoga is a detailed and precise science. The practice of yoga applies just the right amount of pressure on external organs, internal organs, the mind, and even emotions to keep them all in a perfect balance. Through regular practice, one can bring the body in such a harmony that external factors diminish in intensity, and the state of is equilibrium is achieved.""The most important aspect of yoga is breathing. When we breathe right, our entire being exists only in that moment and in that breathe. Everything else fades away until it is just you, the movement of your body and your breath. In that state, there is no space for even thought, let alone anxiety or stress. It is as close to a state of zero a human being can get as is possible within the confines of our body," said the coach.Bhandari is inclined towards 'inversions' for keeping her mental health condition well, as this yogasana sends more blood to our head. As a Yoga instructor she recommends to look at the condition of the body before practicing Yoga because due to overreach it might cause injury. She also suggested some yogasans to be mentally healthy."The most basic to start with is Ujjayi breathing. This is the first and the foremost step and the fundamental of your practice as this is the manner in which you will breathe no matter which posture or asana you hold. You can then progress to the Vipritkarniasana, which is a simple legs against the wall while your upper body rests on the bed pose. Post which you can try the Sarvangasana, Downward Dog, Upward Dog, Bhujangasana, Adhomukhswanasana and many more," said Garima Bhandari.In today's scenario, it is important for everyone to realise that mental health is equally as important as physical health. It is something which should never be ignored as it can leads to an unhealthy life. Yoga is one of the key to lead a happy and prospers life.The International Yoga Day is annually observed on June 21 since 2015. Due to the outbreak this year's theme for Yoga Day is "Yoga at Home and Yoga with Family".The first International Day of Yoga was observed all over the world on June 21, 2015. The idea of International Day of Yoga was first proposed by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his speech at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on September 27, 2014.

BLEIWEIS, SOL   It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Sol Bleiweis. He passed away peacefully in his Gainesville, Florida home on June 15th, 2020 at the age of 91.   Sol was born in Lódz, Poland on December 24th, 1928 to his parents Henry and Esther Bleiweis. Sol was a Holocaust survivor. He was imprisoned in the Lódz ghetto before he was transferred to multiple different Nazi concentration camps, including Aushwitz-Birkenau. He survived the loss of numerous family members, a death march and unimaginable atrocities before he was liberated from Bergen-Belsen.   After the war, Sol spent his young adult years traveling Europe pursuing his passion for boxing and soccer. He eventually reunited with his father, who was his only surviving immediate family member. His mother and brother were victims of the Nazi regime. Sol emigrated to the United States and enlisted in the U.S. Army to serve in the Korean War. He was a proud veteran.   Sol was a textile engineer and business owner. He lived in New York, New Jersey and California before settling a mile from his son, Mark, and his daughter-in-law Jennifer, in Gainesville. He is survived by his wife of 58 years, Beverly Bleiweis, and his children, Mark, Glenn, Shari, Bonnie, Ted and Lisa. He also is survived by thirteen grandchildren and 5 great-grandchildren.   Sol loved watching all sports, hitting the speed bag in his garage and talking politics. Family members describe Sol as 'larger than life.' He was an avid storyteller and never met a stranger. His gregarious personality and unending stories were an inspiration not only for his family and friends, but also to students at all levels with whom he shared his life experiences.   In lieu of flowers, the family asks that friends make donations to one of the following: the Chabad Jewish Center at the University of Florida or Congregation Bnai Israel, of the Center for Jewish Studies at the University of Florida.

In a high-stakes Big Two derby, Linfield needed to win to clinch the title while Glentoran needed at least a point to bring the title race down to the final day.
 With approximately 12,000 in attendance at the Oval, former Manchester City trainee Stephen Parkhouse fired the Glens into a 24th-minute lead.
 Linfield quickly bounced back through Paul McAreavey's left-footed volley before Colin Nixon restored Glentoran's lead shortly after the restart.

On whether the Chinese economy will collapse first or the US dollar head for a painful reset hinges a primary effect of the China-US struggle, which has over the past three years especially become an existential matter for both countries. Financial, manufacturing and service chains from countries across the world are de-linking from the PRC if dependent on the US, a trend that will only intensify in coming years. Separating from Chinese supply chains that have long generated huge returns for US and other corporations is a hard ask, but is becoming necessary under expanding security protocols. Even Chinese students in US universities are coming under the radar, while across the board, the FBI and other elements of the robust Homeland Security system in the US are checking on transfer of intellectual property to China by visitors to either country from the other. Taiwan is on the way towards a complete reset of the "China Embrace" that was a mark of the earlier KMT period. Under President Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan has from the start of her term been distancing itself from China. This policy has led to Taiwan escaping the fate of Italy, where linkages with the PRC have grown substantially during the past 15 years. Being tied to both the US and the PRC is becoming untenable, as a worried Australia is finding out. That country, unlike Italy or Germany, seems to have read the tea leaves and has begun the process of de-coupling from China. In contrast, India is still in the "non-aligned" box, maintaining a welter of conflicting relationships.

Ride High may have changed the Australian pacing landscape with an audacious performance in tonight's Vale Rod Osborne Pace, blazing home in a 52.7-second last half to record a stunning first up win.
 Race caller Dan Mielicki was running out of superlatives to thrust on to the Clayton Tonkin trained five-year-old, who produced an 11th win in only his 12th start.
 "He has absolutely demolished them," called Mielicki, as Ride High rattled home in 25.7 seconds to win in a 1:51.6 mile rate, despite a regulation first half over the short distance. "Now listen to this it's going to blow you away ... the last half-mile (52.7), wow. That's as fast as I've ever heard."
 In her first steer of the _Art Major_ entire out of All The Magic, Kima Frenning comfortably guided the short-priced favourite to the front and when she allowed him to run for the last half he proved in a class of his own.
 "That was just ridiculous," Frenning said. "How easy he did that, how good he is. Still untapped, that was pretty cool.
 "It makes me a bit emotional. As a junior driver to get an opportunity to drive a horse like this. Obviously when you get on you just don't want to stuff up, that's what makes me a bit scared. It's super cool. I can't thank Emma (Stewart) and Clayton enough, they have done so much for me and been unreal. They're awesome."

The Shipping Ministry led by Mansukh Mandaviya is enticing global shipowners to flag their ships in India, reviving a much debated topic that has often lost steam over the lack of a level playing field and the high cost of operating a ship registered in the country, compared to those registered overseas.
 The carrot dangled before global shipowners this time is the ‘Make in India’ policy that was recently revised for public procurement, among others, of all services. Under the revised policy, no global tender enquiry shall be issued, except with the approval of the competent authority, for procurement of all services with estimated value of less than Rs 200 crore.
 Last week, Shipping Minister Mandaviya reviewed the Indian shipping industry’s preparedness to implement the government's cargo transportation policy. The Shipping Ministry estimates that the ‘Make in India’ policy will provide opportunity to at least double the number of Indian flag vessels employed in overseas trade in the immediate term - from the present 459 ships to at least 900 and more over a period of three years.
 India allows 100 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) under the automatic route in the shipping industry, but foreign fleet owners have so far shied away from setting up shop in India, citing an unfavourable tax regime and operating conditions.
 The growth of the Indian fleet has been primarily affected by the lack of long-term bankable cargo contracts, the higher cost of capital, relatively higher tax incidence and an overall global slowdown in the shipping industry, according to the Shipping Ministry.
 For instance, the difference in cost between a foreign flag container vessel and an Indian flag container vessel operating along the Indian coast was 41 per cent in favour of a foreign flag in 2015, according to the managing director at the Indian unit of a European container shipping company. “That’s not a level playing field at all,” he said.
 “The government has to bring in a level-playing field. Indian flag ships need the support of the Government of India now more than ever,” he added.
 A series of missteps taken by the government, including a planned tweaking of rules to avail of the right of first refusal (RoFR), available to Indian shipping companies in carrying cargo owned by state-run firms and allowing state-owned oil firms to move one-third of their annual crude imports on cost, insurance and freight (CIF) basis (wherein the shipping arrangement is the responsibility of the crude supplier) have led local fleet owners to say that the government was not interested in building a strong national fleet.
 The plan to change the RoFR policy – by giving top preference to Indian-built ships in carrying cargo or providing other services such as dredging and offshore oil exploration support activities for state-run entities - has been stalled by a Delhi court on a petition filed by some of the local fleet owners.
 Foreign ships carried 905.834 million tonnes (mt) or 92.9 per cent of India’s export-import (EXIM) trade of 975.542 mt shipped by sea in FY18.
 India pays more than $52 billion in freight to foreign shipping companies annually, according to the Reserve Bank of India.
 “I can’t think of a single maritime nation with this volume of trade – India does more than a billion tonnes of trade annually - not keen on building a strong national fleet. Countries such as China, Korea and Japan are going out on a limb to control more of their cargo through free-on-board (FOB) contracts to build a robust fleet,” said the managing director of a Mumbai-based shipping company.
 In FOB contracts, the buyer is responsible for tying up the shipping arrangements.
 Even a small country like Singapore, which does not have much trade, the way they try to attract shipping, shows how this industry can have multiplier effects - it creates services, helps insurance, a lot of spin-off benefits are there, he added.

Henry Flynn, Jr.   1931-2020   Henry Flynn, Jr., was born in Houston, Texas, on June 14th, 1931. He was the son of Henry Flynn, Sr., and Lettie Olean Tracy. Shortly after birth, he went to live in Port Arthur, where he grew up. He attended Woodrow Wilson Jr. High and Thomas Jefferson Sr. High School, graduating in June of 1949. During this time, he was active in Boy Scouts, earning his Eagle rank at the age of sixteen.   Henry attended Rice University from 1949 to 1954, earning two degrees in Chemical Engineering. He married Susan Jane Bentley in 1953 at the beginning of his final year of college. Before marriage, Henry and Sue agreed to be active in church and Christian endeavors, and to tithe their gross income. Henry continued through with this for the rest of his life, and the blessings of God have been returned many times over.   After graduation, Henry accepted a job with American Oil in Texas City, Texas. After two years, he was transferred to Yorktown, Virginia, where he lived for three years before transfer to Joliet, Illinois. With the move to the Joliet plant, he switched from the refining to the chemical division of the company, where he worked 29 years. He finally transferred back to Texas in Chocolate Bayou, where he retired in 1992. Throughout his career, Henry continued to advance in his occupation. He eventually became the Superintendent of Operations in Joliet and Technical Director in Chocolate Bayou. The move back to Texas was an answer to prayer to get away from the harsh Illinois winters and be near two of his daughters and grandchildren. In October of 1992, Amoco was downsizing and offered financial incentives for early retirement. Henry gladly accepted the offer at the age of 61, retiring after 37 years of service.   Throughout his life, Henry enjoyed genealogy and became a member of the Sons of the Republic of Texas. Additionally, Henry's faith was very important to him. At a young age, he asked Jesus to be his Savior and Lord. Throughout his life, he studied God's word, put it into practice in his life and taught it to many others. While attending local Baptist churches, Henry taught youth and young adults, served as church treasurer, attended Billy Graham's first U.S. Congress on Evangelism, and went with the Southern Baptist Foreign Mission Board on a Mission trip to the Philippines. In Henry's own words, the trip to the Philippines "was a marvelous experience and one of the spiritual highlights of my life."   During his time in Joliet, he and his family began attending Calvary Temple, an Assembly of God church in Naperville, Illinois, because of the outstanding teaching, and his Christian walk grew tremendously as a result. While there, Henry went on mission trips to Munich, Germany, and Paraguay and became a certified instructor in Evangelism Explosion.   After the transfer back to Texas, he made his home in Friendswood. Upon retirement, he became involved in the ministry of Promise Keepers, serving as the local coordinator. He served on the Board of the local Crisis Pregnancy Center, Faithful Fathering, and Action Ministries. He also financially supported many ministries.   Henry was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2005 and fought hard through the rest of his life. He finally succumbed from health complications due to Parkinson's on June 9th, 2020, and is now with Jesus, whole once again. His family would like to express their gratitude to the health care workers who saw to his every need around the clock for the last two years of his life. You are like family to us, and we cannot adequately express our thanks to you for going above and beyond in your care of him.   Henry is survived by his loving wife, Sue, and his daughters Linda (Ron) Clark, Clarke (Paul) Hines, and Kate (Ninja) Escobedo, seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.   In lieu of customary remembrances, please send memorial contributions to the Beltway 8 South Crisis Pregnancy Center or Faithful Fathering Ministries.

Although Linfield were beaten only once in their opening 13 league matches, they had only picked up two points from their last three outings before their trip to Mourneview Park.
 They had soundly defeated the Lurgan Blues 4-0 at Windsor Park back in August, but Glenavon had made steady progress since moving into a top six spot by the start of November.
 And the Blues' hopes of arresting their slide were dented when referee Tim Marshall dismissed both Matthew Clarke and Roy Carroll, the former for his foul on Andy McGrory and the latter for dissent, leaving the Blues with nine men for all of 79 minutes.
 The visitors, who now had defender Mark Haughey between the sticks, then went a goal behind after the enigmatic Paddy McCourt broke the deadlock on 29 minutes with his first league goal for the Lurgan Blues.
 Five minutes later it looked as if Gary Hamilton's side had wrapped up all three points when Greg Moorhouse made it 2-0 after volleying past Haughey before Andy Waterworth's header gave the travelling Linfield faithful hope just after the hour.
 Despite their numerical disadvantage the Blues continued their search for an equaliser and their persistence was rewarded when half-time substitute, Paul Smyth, poked the ball home with just two minutes remaining to give Healy's men a dramatic, unlikely point.

Since the rise of Covid-19, the world has become more attentive to the impact of our daily consumption habits. Images of smog-free air and clear blue rivers have been passed around the internet as the world stands in awe of the monthslong transformation that has occurred in our environment. As an increased number of people are remaining home as opposed to commuting to and from work each day, we have seen the impact that each person can make day by day on the climate crises we continue to face.
 As the fight to end this global pandemic continues, so does the fight to end climate change. As our consumption patterns have faced an unexpected turn, we are presented with an opportunity to reflect upon how we as individuals contribute to the global climate crises and more specifically the climate crises occurrence in the global south.
 The Global South is a term that is in direct relation with the term Developing Nations as the Global North can be used interchangeably with Developed Nations. The Global South has been directly impacted by the consumption habits that occur in the Global North for decades. As the fast fashion industry and commercial farming have come to the forefront of markets in the Global North, we rely heavily on Global South for increased production often at a very low cost. As an individual living in the United States, the majority of items that I consume on a day to day basis come from the Global South. Whether it’s a T-shirt from Bangladesh, a banana from Chile or oil from Nigeria, the items I utilize every day are often at the expense of wage laborers in foreign countries. You’re probably asking yourself why does this matter? And what does this have anything to do with the recent development of Covid-19?
 First, I want to address what this truly has to do with the current state of the global pandemic. As Covid-19 continues to affect our social lives, our jobs and our families, it is also having a tremendous impact on the availability and accessibility of various goods. The food system in the Global North has become greatly dependent on large commercialized farming, either within the United States or within various nations of the Global South. As the pandemic is affecting the stock market and the economy, it is also becoming increasingly difficult for commercial farms to operate at their regular capacity due to the impact Covid-19 is having on the job force. As large commercial farms are having difficulties producing at optimal levels, consumers are now reaping the consequences. The cost and availability of items such as meat, eggs, toilet paper and produce have changed drastically as the demand for these goods continues to rise. The Global North is now experiencing the negative side effects of relying on a monopolized food system and we as consumers have the ability to change this.
 In fact, we have the responsibility to change this.
 About a month after the pandemic began to affect my life here in North Carolina, I began to wonder how my choices extend far beyond the United States. I tracked nearly everything I consumed for a week and where it came from. I found a few different things during this experiment. First off, about 90 percent of the items or food that I consume daily come from the Global South. Second, I realized that for so many products, (most of which were various packaged food items such as soup or canned veggies) it was nearly impossible to find where the ingredients were sourced. As consumers, we are far too often left in the dark about the origins of the products we consume. As this global pandemic continues to affect people’s lives and the things we consume, I urge you to keep track of your consumption habits for one week (or one day even). Where do your clothes, your phones, your car, your TV and even your food come from? By tracking your consumption patterns, I believe that you, as a consumer, will gain much more than just knowledge. You will gain autonomy and agency over your life and the items you rely on. By growing your own food, shopping for produce locally, buying clothes made in the United States or second hand, and utilizing the local resources that are available to you, you can not only make a positive change for the environment but you can become an active contributor to stimulating local communities, organizations and farmers. It is through our simple day to day actions and decisions that we can begin to fight the climate crises as one collective entity.
 Let’s begin to make a change; we are in this together.

Answers are hard to come by but events since May 5 and 6, including the deadly clash in the Galwan Valley and the subsequent statements from both sides, have further muddied waters. While China lays claim to the entire Galwan Valley contrary to earlier ground position and India accuses Chinese troops of trying to forcibly alter the status quo on the ground, the tactical battle of attrition will likely get worse before any solution is found by military commanders. For India, nothing less than restoration of status quo ante will be acceptable, especially on the north bank of the Pangong Tso in Ladakh. China, meanwhile, would like to maintain its upper hand in that location even if it disengages at other places like the Galwan Valley. It will take a combination of hard-nosed diplomacy and military acumen to achieve India's immediate objective. Whatever be the outcome, it will not prevent a chilling effect on India-China relations in the long term. The spirit of Wuhan and Mamallapuram is now dead.

Advice at the time of a crisis, especially when it involves the big bad dragon on our northern border, comes not as a tickle but as a tsunami from all quarters. The Chinese had been sending their patrols not only to Fingers in the Pangong Tso and Galwan areas, but also in North Sikkim and other regions almost every year. Local Army commanders have been dealing with these intrusions, and every time after showing the flag, these issues were resolved. However, the moment the Chinese needed to up the ante as it were, all that it would require would be to identify the right people to start making noises in the media. The rest, not to be outdone, would flock to the fore and do the rest. Psycho-analysts in China would then simply have to put away their crystal balls and simply switch on Indian TV channels to know what was happening on the southern side of the Himalayas.

India has questioned the rationale of joint statements issued by some countries at the World Trade Organization (WTO) pushing for greater opening of markets for agricultural products. It has argued that for developing countries, export restrictions are a tool to prevent domestic shortages and are essential.
 The country made a case against permanent tariff concessions or a dilution of the tariff bindings at a special meeting of the Committee on Agriculture (CoA) in Geneva recently. “Members reviewed a number of farm-support packages and export-restrictive measures adopted as response to the Covid-19 crisis,” a trade official in Geneva told _BusinessLine_.
 While India asked other countries to formulate a “balanced, inclusive and calibrated” response to Covid-19, it disagreed with the idea of permanent tariff concessions, or a dilution of the tariff bindings as a response to a temporary crisis.
 New Delhi also warned about a growing narrative that seeks to prohibit the use of export restrictions on medical and agricultural products. "For developing countries, export restrictions are a WTO-consistent policy tool that are important to prevent critical domestic shortages of essential supplies," India said.
 A recent Canada-led joint statement, a new Cairns Group initiative and an Ottawa Group statement, all made a case for open and predictable trade amidst the Covid-19 crisis.
 Australia, Chile, Japan, Norway, Brazil, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Columbia, Russia and Jamaica expressed their full support for Canada’ s joint statement, in which the co-sponsors vowed to refrain from imposing trade-restrictive measures that would ultimately have a negative impact on the food security, nutrition and health of members and their populations.
 The new Cairns group proposal presented by Australia stated that Covid-19 export restrictive measures should be “targeted, proportionate, transparent, temporary and consistent with the WTO rules”.
 It recommended greater WTO scrutiny of Covid-19 agriculture-support measures — including tracking by the WTO secretariat, regular CoA discussions and a voluntary, member-driven WTO Covid-19 Agricultural Working Group.
 Questions were also targeted at the US’s $19 billion Coronavirus Food Assistance Program, launched in April 2020, including $16 billion in direct support to farmers and ranchers.

 But Cliftonville, on the back of two straight wins, demonstrated their newfound confidence as Daniel Hughes, Jay Donnelly and Ruairi Harkin fired them into a seemingly unassailable lead with less than half an hour remaining.
 Not to be outdone, though, the Crues came roaring back, with Jordan Owens helping himself to a double to set up a nail-biting finale. Michael Carvill looked to have stolen a point for Stephen Baxter's men but up popped David Cushley in the 94th minute to give them all three.

"articleBody": "Liverpool can close to within one win of a first league title in 30 years when the English champions-elect return to action for the first time in three months against local rivals Everton on Sunday. Liverpool have a 22-point lead in the Premier League table and need two wins from their last nine matches to end the wait for a league title. However, Liverpool could be champions as soon as Monday if they beat Everton and Manchester City lose to Burnley 24 hours later. Despite concerns over supporters congregating around the stadiums, Sunday's clash will take place at Everton's Goodison Park (kick off 1800GMT), less than a mile from Liverpool's Anfield home. A Merseyside derby like no other will take place behind closed doors, but Klopp is just relieved to have the chance to complete the job on the field after some suggested the season be declared null and void due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Similar conditions for Egyptians unable to travel abroad has contributed to a spike in domestic tourism, Faisal said. "That business has seen a boom because Egyptians can't go anywhere now, and in reality there are more Egyptians that can't fly out of Cairo for tourism abroad than tourists that would come to Egypt," Faisal said. "Actually, this weekend you cannot find a single apartment to rent in El Gouna," he said, referring to a town just north of Hurghada.

A very 1930s phenomenon across both political parties, not only a Labour thing.      Think back a bit, the end of the 19th century exposed idiocy as a common and economy-sapping phenomenon. Largely brought about by limited travel and genetic sourcing opportunities. Didn't matter much in a largely agricultural country but it did matter in an industrial economy with one eye on war. Something must be done.      To a control freak eugenics looks like an answer. Ticks all the boxes, sense of superiority, prurient interest in sex, keep the lower orders in line and of course racism and class. But the real answer was the bicycle, fixed the problem at source.      Find an elderly doctor and ask how idiocy was handled up till the early '60s. Sterilisation was more common than you might think, pretexts for an operation 'down there' were thought up and a nip and tuck, voila.      You can be sure today's problems have their roots 30 or 40 years back and clever people will come up with daft 'solutions' and politicians will buy them, so we go on.

Maguire was fearful for the Gas’ future if the owner’s commitment dwindled, with “drastic cuts in spending” a best case scenario if he were to end his bankrolling abruptly.
 That has proven not to be the case, with Al-Qadi giving the firmest possible message that he is in it for the long haul by converting the debt owed to Dwane Sports into shares.
 Al-Qadi received plenty of stick from Bristol Rovers Supporters’ Club (BRSC) following the release of the accounts and the Ken Masters saga, and the group’s eight per cent stake in the club will be significantly diluted as a result.

At the same time as responding across the board to Chinese incursions of the LAC, innovative diplomacy needs to be initiated to try and ensure that President Xi Jinping distances CCP policy from the disastrous policy options being promoted by GHQ Rawalpindi to the PLA. Fast-track settlement of the boundary issue by making the LAC the legal border would be in the best interests of not just India but China.
