Additionally, similar challenges persist for students in rural tribal communities, many of whom need to travel far from home just to access an internet hotspot or some other form of connection. Even communities that have connections often face reliability issues, according to Dr. Chad S. Hamill, vice president for Native American initiatives at Northern Arizona University.

Once operational, the fiber networks will provide Navajo Nation with direct connections to high-capacity connectivity, enabling the tribe to fully participate in the 21st century’s connected economy, according to the company.

“The disparity of homes connected to high-speed internet on Native lands versus the rest of America leaves tribal nations at a significant disadvantage,” he said. “The Sustainable Tribal Networks program is a significant step forward in providing us with the same opportunities as the rest of America in today’s digital age. COVID-19 underscores just how imperative it is that we get every home in tribal communities connected. We are facing significant challenges in communicating updates about the pandemic, establishing emergency and social services as we’re further isolated during these unprecedented times.”

MuralNet also is working with various tribes on “Community Builds,” which it describes as “a working group-centered incubator focused on building the internal capacity of Tribes to design, deploy, maintain and grow their own sustainable community networks.” The groups are intended to speed the development of wireless network connectivity for tribes across the U.S.

“This unique partnership uses long-haul fiber route construction as an economic development tool for the Navajo people,” Arcadian Infracom CEO Dan Davis said in a statement. “Given the ongoing COVID-19 public health emergency within the Navajo Nation, it is imperative that we continue to work closely together to create opportunities for the Nation to move beyond the tragic reality that they currently have no scaled fiber backbone connectivity to the rest of the world.”

“Internet access was always important, but COVID-19 is exacerbating the large divide between the connected and the unconnected,” Tae Yoo, senior vice president of corporate affairs at Cisco said in a statement. “Now more than ever, the internet is critical for rural Tribal communities — it can connect them to vital health and educational services in the midst of the pandemic as well as provide them access to long-term economic opportunities. Together with MuralNet, we hope to help these communities build their own networks, while at the same time, help them build thriving and sustainable futures.”

MuralNet and its affiliates have submitted more than 100 applications to license 2.5GHz spectrum that the Federal Communications Commission is making available to tribes via a Tribal Priority Window that closed on Sept. 2. The window was supposed to close on Aug. 3, but was extended by 30 days to accommodate tribes that had been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, a move that many Native-led groups criticized, as Native News Online previously reported.
