CLEVELAND (AP) — Denzel Ward may be ready to go this week for the Browns, who could face one of their many former quarterbacks against the New York Giants.
 Cleveland's top cornerback returned to practice Wednesday after missing three straight games with a strained calf. Ward was playing at a Pro Bowl level — leading the NFL in passes defensed — when he got hurt last month against Philadelphia.
 The Browns (9-4) will monitor Ward and see how he responds in the next few days before deciding if he'll play against the Giants (5-8).
 It's still up in the air who will be under center for New York. Starting quarterback Daniel Jones is dealing with two leg injuries, the newest sustained while he was being sacked six times in Sunday's loss to the Arizona Cardinals.
 Giants coach Joe Judge said Wednesday that Jones, who was already dealing with a lingering hamstring injury, will be evaluated over the next few days before a decision is made for the game.
 If Jones can't play, the Giants would turn to backup Colt McCoy, a Cleveland draft pick in 2010 who started 21 games for the Browns before they traded him to San Francisco in 2013. McCoy stared for an injured Jones earlier this month and led the Giants to a 17-12 upset of Seattle. He completed 13 of 22 passes for 105 yards with one touchdown and an interception.

CBD can affect how your body handles other medicines. This means you may have higher or lower amounts in your blood than you should. Penn State University researchers found 60 drugs that interact with CBD or cannabis. Be extra careful if you take blood thinners, heart medicine, or drugs that weaken your immune system after transplant surgery. Pierre says that even some psychiatric medicines, including antipsychotics, could interact with CBD. If you take any prescription meds, ask your doctor if CBD is safe to use.

"The front-line workers risked their lives from the start, not knowing what we know now about COVID," said Jodi Isenberg, the Toronto Star's senior editor, Life and Entertainment, in casting her ballot.
 "They gave up more than anyone in this fight, left their families, sometimes were the last face someone at death's door would see. They deserve all the praise we can bestow on them."
 "Most of us did our part by staying home; these front-line workers did their parts by stepping up," said Dawn Walton, CTV Calgary managing editor.
 Historically, the Newsmaker of the Year has most often been a politician or an athlete. But with COVID-19 dominating the news cycle, front-line workers were followed in votes this year by three public health leaders: Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer; Dr. Horacio Arruda, Quebec's director of public health; and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer.
 The pandemic highlighted not only the essential role of front-line workers but also some of the gaps in support for them. From staffing shortages in long- term care homes that amplified the devastation of the disease to pushes for national sick pay and child-care programs, COVID-19 has been a catalyst for change.
 Paul Meinema, national president at United Food and Commercial Workers Canada, said its members, from grocery store workers to food processors, have spent much of the pandemic worried about their safety.
 They've always played an essential role but have never had such public acknowledgment of their value, he said.
 "Many people went to the grocery store each week and never really considered the person who was putting the food on the shelf and checking them out or making sure there was fresh meat and produce on the counter," Meinema said.
 "COVID has exposed the importance of this work."
 That work has been recognized through temporary measures like pandemic pay that the union believes should be made permanent.
 "I think it raised awareness in society generally and I think we're hopeful for a continued societal change recognizing the importance of these jobs,'" Meinema said.
 The pandemic has also highlighted some behind-the-scenes workers who have often gone unnoticed.
 Enzo Caprio, who oversees 15 testing labs in the Montreal and Abitibi- Temiscamingue areas as clinical administrative director for the Optilab-McGill University Health Centre, said the pandemic has shone new light on his staff.

Voting got underway this morning in 3 polling places in Nimba and in Grand Gedeh, under the watchful eyes of LEON observers and party agents. Voting did not take place on 8 December in Tiapa Public School and Gbayee Public Schools, Upper Nimba, District 2, due to lack of polling staff in these remote areas. In Bargblor Public School, Grand Gedeh District 3, people were told not to vote on 8 December because the county name on the ballot box was incorrect. The NEC claims this was false information.

On April 29, 2019, UW quarterback Jacob Sirmon entered his name in the transfer portal, before removing it two days later.
 It's more likely the second time sticks.
 Sirmon — a 6-foot-5, 240-pound redshirt sophomore from Bothell — has again entered the transfer portal, his father David Sirmon confirmed to The Times on Wednesday.
 “This is a positive part of his path," David Sirmon told The Times on Wednesday morning. "It didn’t work out at Washington, like he dreamed it might. That’s just the nature of football, and you keep on fighting for your dreams, and that’s what he’s doing. So he hugged Jimmy. He hugged John. He talked to every person in the program, either to his face or with some type of text.
 "I think he’s leaving on great terms and with a clear heart. He wants to play ball and wishes Washington all the very best.”
 A former Bothell High School standout, Sirmon appeared in six games in his UW career and completed 3 of 4 passes for 28 yards. He served as Jacob Eason's backup last season, completing 2 of 3 passes for 19 yards in mop-up duty. Despite being the odds-on favorite to assume the starting role this offseason, that spot went to redshirt freshman Dylan Morris — who has started all four games this fall.
 When he signed with Washington in 2018, Sirmon was ranked as a four-star prospect, the No. 1 player in the state of Washington, the No. 6 pro-style passer and the No. 94 overall prospect in his class by the 247Sports Composite.

When Emperor Haile Selassie wanted to launch his country's national carrier, he went directly to the United States, the United Kingdom, and the French Government to help him establish his nation's airline. The emperor first sought after and recruited a team of brilliant Ethiopian managers that were capable of effectively negotiating favorable terms for his government, while at the same time successfully selling the project to the Ethiopian people- which the public endorsed. After which his government entered a deal with both Transcontinental Air Transport and Western Air Express on September 8, 1945, and working on behalf of The Ethiopian Government signed an agreement to establish a commercial aviation company.

Two of Canada's most prominent cannabis companies are combining in a blockbuster deal that will see the pair become the world's largest pot firm based on revenue and control the largest share of the country's retail market.
 Leamington, Ont.-based Aphria Inc. and Nanaimo-based Tilray Inc. said Wednesday that they will merge under the Tilray name — a move they say will help them unlock $100 million in savings and position them to dominate in the Canadian and U.S. markets.
 "This transaction brings together two leading cannabis companies, creating a clear global leader, strengthening our global footprint and positioning the new Tilray for further growth," Tilray chief executive Brendan Kennedy told a conference call with financial analysts.
