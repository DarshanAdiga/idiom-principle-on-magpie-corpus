Barcelona will face Paris Saint-Germain in the round of 16 of the Champions League in a rematch of their classic encounter at the same stage four seasons ago.
 The marquee matchup of Qatar-backed clubs that takes Neymar back to Barcelona headlined the knockout-stage pairings made Monday.
 In 2017, PSG wasted a 4-0 first-leg lead by losing 6-1 at Camp Nou in the second leg when Barcelona scored three goals from the 88th minute on.
 Neymar scored Barcelona’s fourth goal but left Lionel Messi’s side after that season and switched to PSG for a world-record transfer fee of 222 million euros ($262 million). PSG also did not have Kylian Mbappé four seasons ago.

Lee said the vaccines will be given on a voluntary basis and will be free for citizens and long-term residents. He said he and some older Cabinet ministers will be vaccinated early as a demonstration that the vaccines are safe.
 Priority will be given to healthcare workers and front-line personnel, as well as the elderly and other vulnerable people, before the rest of the population, he said.
 “Now that vaccines are becoming available, we can see light at the end of the tunnel,” Lee said.
 “The more of us are vaccinated, the harder it will be for the virus to spread, and the safer we will all be as a society,” he said, adding that it will bolster Singapore’s economic recovery.
