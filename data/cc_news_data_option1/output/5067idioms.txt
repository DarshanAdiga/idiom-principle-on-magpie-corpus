CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — SpaceX launched its shiny, bullet- shaped, straight-out-of-science fiction Starship several miles into the air from a remote corner of Texas on Wednesday, but the 6 1/2-minute test flight ended in an explosive fireball at touchdown. It was the highest and most elaborate flight yet for the rocketship that Elon Musk says could carry people to Mars in as little as six years. Despite the catastrophic end, he was thrilled. “Mars, here we come!!” he tweeted. This latest prototype — the first one equipped with a nose cone, body flaps and three engines — was shooting for an altitude of up to eight miles (12.5 kilometers). That’s almost 100 times higher than previous hops and skimming the stratosphere. Starship seemed to hit the mark or at least come close. There was no immediate word from SpaceX on how high it went. The full-scale, stainless steel model — 160 feet (50 meters) tall and 30 feet (9 meters) in diameter — soared out over the Gulf of Mexico. After about five minutes, it flipped sideways as planned and descended in a free-fall back to the southeastern tip of Texas near the Mexican border. The Raptor engines reignited for braking and the rocket tilted back upright. When it touched down, however, the rocketship became engulfed in flames and ruptured, parts scattering. The entire flight — as dramatic and flashy as it gets, even by SpaceX standards — lasted six minutes and 42 seconds. SpaceX broadcast the sunset demo live on its website; repeated delays over the past week and a last-second engine abort Tuesday heightened the excitement among space fans. Musk called it a “successful ascent” and said the body flaps precisely guided the rocket to the landing point. The fuel tank pressure was low, however, when the engines...

I love charcuterie boards because anything goes! And this year, with COVID-19 keeping everyone home and no large family gatherings being permitted, pull out all the stops and make your loved ones feel extra special. Pull out the fine china, your best crystal, and polish the silverware. Get some fancy napkins and go crazy with ingredients. Here are some suggestions but honestly…the sky is the limit. Stop into your local deli – they are offering lots of great options to keep your family intrigued on their taste journey around the board.

Newstead also raised doubts about alleged harms caused by Facebook, arguing that consumers benefited from its decision to make WhatsApp free, and rivals like YouTube, Twitter and WeChat did "just fine" without access to its developer platform.
 Facebook's Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told employees in July that Facebook would "go to the mat" to fight a legal challenge to break up the company, calling it an "existential" threat, according to audio of internal company meetings published by The Verge.
 Although breakup remedies are rare, some antitrust experts said the case was unusually strong given damning statements by Zuckerberg plucked from Facebook's own documents, like a 2008 email in which he said "it is better to buy than compete."
 Other experts such as Seth Bloom of Bloom Strategic Counsel said the FTC complaint was "significantly weaker" than the DOJ's lawsuit against Google.
 "We're talking about acquisitions that are six or eight years old and it will be difficult for a court to order divestitures of many years ago," Bloom said.
 Investors echoed similar concerns.
 "I do not know if the FTC or DOJ will be successful in breaking Facebook up. I'm assuming this will be dragged out in the courts as FB defends itself," said Daniel Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust in Atlanta, Georgia.

The backdrop for companies going public this year has been more than welcoming. The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates near zero since this spring in a bid to support the economy through its pandemic-driven recession. That helped pave the way for stocks to climb to new highs and gave companies confidence to go public.
 Airbnb put off a market debut in the spring when the pandemic crippled global travel. It’s hoping to raise as much as $3.4 billion in its IPO. The San Francisco company expects to price its shares between $56 and $60 each, up from a planned range of $44 to $50 issued last week.
 Some 18 company IPOs have brought in over a billion dollars, including DoorDash. Four others, including Airbnb, are also expected to cross the billion-dollar threshold.
 Still, individual investors may want to consider waiting a few days after a company has its IPO, if not longer.

For further emphasis on the Bucks shooting implosion, they registered a 23-for-89 (25.8 percent) mark in the fourth quarter from deep across those two series while Toronto and Miami combined for 35-for-91 (38.4 percent). Put simply, the Bucks haven't delivered when the heat has been turned up to the max.
 In searching for added marksmen from the outisde, the Bucks have acquired Augustin, Holiday, Bryn Forbes and Bobby Portis while also drafting two of the best shooters in the class in Jordan Nwora and Sam Merrill.
 Ultimately though, the Bucks achieving their goal of an NBA championship will rest on the shoulders of Antetokounmpo, who has been a tremendous playoff performer with one potentially fatal flaw.
 Averaging 25.9 points, 12.8 rebounds and 5.2 assists across the last two postseasons, Antetokounmpo is the only player to average 25/10/5 across the last two playoffs. While the effectiveness of the much-publicized 'Giannis- stopping wall' is an entirely different story on its own, the free-throw line is where the most obvious leap can be made.


--DocBreak--
A 72 percent shooter from the stripe on 6.7 attempts per game across his regular-season career, Antetokounmpo has languished at 56.4 percent on 10.1 attempts per game in the series against Toronto and Miami. It could be playoff pressure, it could be fatigue, it could be mechanical, with the most likely truth being a combination of all, but the Bucks need Antetokounmpo to see an uptick from the free-throw line, particularly in close playoff games.
 The hot take is to suggest the Bucks are simply a regular season team not built for the postseason, but looking back on both of their defeats you'll find they were closer than you are perhaps led to believe.
 However, it doesn't matter how close they were, they lost, and with each stumble, the pressure increases. Perhaps Holiday is the steadying postseason presence they need. Perhaps Antetokounmpo finds his stroke at the free-throw line. Perhaps Budenholzer shortens his playoff rotation in order to maximize the impact of his best players.
 Sure, an Antetokounmpo extension would significantly release the blowtorch being shined on the franchise from all angles, but the recent examples of Anthony Davis in New Orleans and the current James Harden situation in Houston are sharp reminders that nothing is for certain even if he signs on the dotted line.
 "The conversations between Giannis and myself have been really, really good," Budenholzer said. "Whether it be as we made it through the summer or through these first few days of training camp. To me it's just all about winning with Giannis, that's all he cares about so from a coach's perspective it makes it very easy to have great conversations with him."
 "I think he's in a really good place, we're in a really good place. We want to win at the highest levels, he wants the same thing so I think we all feel really good about those conversations and that day-to-day interaction. We feel incredibly fortunate that he's with us. He's the best of the best and we're fortunate to have him in our building, have him practicing every day."
 This season will mark the 50-year anniversary of the Bucks' sole championship as the franchise enters arguably the most important in its history. How's that for pressure?

Merchant payments company BharatPe has overtaken Google Pay to become the third largest player in the merchant UPI payment acceptance space.
 "BharatPe is an Indian startup and it is a proud moment for us to displace a global behemoth like Google Pay from the No. 3 position," said Ashneer Grover, co-founder and CEO, BharatPe.
 The company said in a statement it has recorded INR 3,334 crore (USD 479 million) in transaction value in a total of 6.15 crore transactions for the month of November.
 With these numbers, the Delhi-based company claims to have cornered 5 per cent market share by transaction value and 7 per cent market share by transaction volume for the first time. It added that the volume of transactions processed by BharatPe standalone last month is greater than the combined UPI peer-to- merchant transaction volume of JIO, Zomato, Swiggy, CRED, FlipKart, CashFree, IRCTC and MPL.
 "The offline retail market is, in order of magnitude, larger than the online/ecommerce market in a country like India and digitizing fast. BharatPe's differentiated financial services proposition focused at the merchant outweighs all other services being targeted by other UPI / VAS players," Grover added.
 Founded in 2018 by Ashneer Grover and Shashvat Nakrani, BharatPe offers interoperable UPI QR to merchants at zero transaction fee. It claims to be the first player to launch UPI interoperable QR code, first ZERO MDR payment acceptance service and first UPI payment backed merchant cash advance service.
 Currently, it serves over 50 lakh merchants across more than 50 cities and has facilitated disbursement of over INR 500 crore to its merchants since its launch.
 "We intend to grow our business five times in the next 2 years, to cross USD 30 bn TPV. We are bullish on lending and aim to disburse loans of USD 1 bn to small merchants and kiranas by 2023," Suhail Sameer, Group President, BharatPe.
 BharatPe is backed by a clutch of marquee investors, including Beenext, Sequoia, SteadView Capital, Ribbit Capital, Coatue Management LLC, Insight Partners, and Amplo.

Consider that about half of U.S.-based companies that went public from 2015 to 2019, including Uber Technologies, Fitbit and Blue Apron, were trading below their IPO prices a year later. It took Facebook 15 months to trade above its IPO price.
 “Looking back at history, it’s pretty much been a coin toss as to how these stocks perform a year after they go public,” said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest.
 Investors need to make sure they are buying into an IPO because they believe in the company’s prospects for earnings growth and avoid being swept away by the hype that tends to form around big-name stocks.
 Another consideration is whether a company has proven it can make a profit. Uber, which raised $8.1 billion in its market debut last year, has yet to get out of the red.

Behind back-to-back MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee has rattled off a 116-39 win-loss record over the course of the last two regular seasons. Only the coronavirus shutdown prevented them from consecutive 60-win campaigns for the first time since the early 1970s when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar led the Bucks to its lone championship.
 The major difference between the two squads is the fact the Bucks won the title in 1971 in the first of those 60-win seasons, while the current version has thus far faulted in the postseason, as pressure mounts to capitalize on their window of opportunity.
 The number one storyline heading into free agency league-wide is the Antetokounmpo decision, with the 26-year-old eligible to sign a five-year supermax extension to stay in Milwaukee in what would be the richest deal in NBA history – projected at $227 million.
 While Antetokounmpo is yet to face the media as training camp gets underway, the dark cloud of unrestricted free agency next offseason continues to hover over the team as the Dec. 21 deadline draws near.
 “I mean, my situation last year, he told me how he felt and that’s all I could do in return," teammate Khris Middleton told reporters. "As you know, I think we’re more than friends at this point. We spent eight years together. We’ve been through a lot together also. So, at the end of the day, I know and I want him to do what’s best for him and his family. He knows that I deeply want him to return and sign this extension, but at the same time, I know he’s got a big decision that he’s got to work through himself and with his family at home. Those are the most important people.”

Westbrook is a capable defender — he's consistently among the league leaders in steals and has the size to guard multiple positions — but he's not going to be the one who transforms the Wizards into an above average defensive team. Washington's best bet at being competitive this season is turning games into track meets and running up the score.
 It'll put a ceiling on the Wizards, but trading for Westbrook should move them up a tier in the Eastern Conference, from a team that _could_ make the playoffs to a team that _should_ make the playoffs.
