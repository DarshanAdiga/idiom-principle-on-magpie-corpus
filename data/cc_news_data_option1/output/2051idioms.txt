Creative energy, innovative thinking, a passion and mission to help children and families is still in progress — just in different ways — at the Boys & Girls Club of Watertown. COVID-19 caused the club to close its big blue doors earlier this spring, but the staff and board have been working behind the scenes and collaborating with clubs across the state and nation in figuring out a “new normal” as well as efforts in re-opening those doors ever so gently.
 “While our service delivery model has changed, supporting families has continued,” said Liz Christianson, the Club’s executive director.
 Since mid-March, the organization has continued to provide services through virtual programming and at-home kits for youth. They created an interactive online environment for youth participation which has included weekly hands-on activities. Homework assistance has been provided via Zoom.

MODESTO, Calif. (AP) — The U.S. House's top Republican on Tuesday withdrew his support for a Central California congressional candidate over derogatory online posts about Muslims and Hillary Clinton that the candidate says he did not write.
 House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy rescinded his support for Ted Howze in light of the “disappointing comments,” spokesman Drew Florio said Tuesday.
 "As the leader has previously stated, hateful rhetoric has no place within the Republican Party,” Florio said.
 Howze, who is facing freshman Democrat Josh Harder in the farm belt’s swing 10th District, lost the support last week of the California Republican Party and the campaign arm of House Republicans, the National Republican Congressional Committee.
 Howze said last week he is the target of “maliciously false attacks” and intends to continue his campaign. He said the posts “do not resemble anything close to my personal words or actions.”
 The posts were first reported by the website Politico, which said they were uncovered by Ryan Williams, a Democratic operative who last cycle managed Uniting California, a joint initiative by the California Labor Federation and Tom Steyer’s NextGen America aimed at flipping Republican-held House seats.
 Even if Howze dropped out of the race, his name will appear on the November ballot — he cannot be replaced, according to the California secretary of state’s office. Moreover, there can be no write-in candidates in a “top two” general election, such as for the House district, in California.
