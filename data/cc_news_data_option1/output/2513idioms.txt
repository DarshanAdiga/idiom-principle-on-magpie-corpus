Mumbai terrorist attack convict David Headley cannot be extradited to India, but Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman co-conspirator Tahawwur Rana faces extradition, a US attorney has told a federal court while opposing his bail plea.
 Rana, 59, a childhood friend of David Coleman Headley, was recently rearrested on June 10 in Los Angeles on an extradition request by India for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack in which 166 people, including six Americans, were killed. He is a declared fugitive in India.
 According to the federal prosecutors, between 2006 and November 2008, Rana conspired with Headley, also known as "Daood Gilani", and others in Pakistan to assist Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Harakat ul-Jihad-e-Islami, both US- designated terrorist organisations, to plan and carry out the Mumbai terrorist attacks.
 Pakistani-American LeT terrorist Headley was involved in plotting the 2008 Mumbai terror attack. He was made an approver in the case, and is currently serving a 35-year prison term in the US for his role in the attack.
   
   
 The US is yet to file India's request for Rana's extradition, but is expected to do it soon. It is evident that the offences for which Rana was tried in the Illinois court will differ from the Indian offences mentioned in the complaint.
 Rana in his defence has argued that US' decision not to extradite his co- conspirator, Headley, to India is inconsistent and bars his extradition.
 However, Assistant US Attorney John J Lulejian told a federal court in Los Angeles on Friday that unlike Rana, Headley immediately accepted responsibility for his conduct and pleaded guilty to all of the charges in the Superseding Indictment.
 "Because Headley fulfilled the required terms, the plea agreement established that Headley would not be extradited to India. Rana's situation is different because he neither pleaded guilty nor cooperated with the United States.
 "As a result, he is unable to avail himself of the benefits afforded to Headley through his negotiated plea. Thus, he cannot complain that he faces extradition, while his co-defendant does not," the US attorney said.
 Rana's bail application is due for hearing next week. Early this week, his attorney told the court that the 26/11 convict is not a flight risk and has proposed a USD 1.5 million bond for his release.
 "Rana should be released on a robust bond: secured by approximately USD 1.5 million in property pledged by family and friends and under the supervision of his daughter, Lemaan Rana, a matriculating medical student and Ph.D. candidate," Amy Karlin, the Interim Federal Public Defender, said in the court submission on behalf of Rana.
 India seeks his arrest on a number of offences, including the conspiracy to commit murder, conspiracy to commit forgery for the purpose of cheating, and murder under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). He is sought for his role in 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai.
 The US attorney urged the court to continue his detention pending the extradition proceedings to India. Describing Rana as a flight risk, the attorney said that no matter what bond package he offers, Rana poses an unacceptable flight risk.
 If the US extradites Rana to India and he is convicted of the charges, he may be eligible for the death penalty. Given what is at stake, Rana has an extreme incentive to flee and avoid facing these extradition proceedings, Lulejian said.
 "He could accomplish this by going into hiding within the US, but he has a particular incentive to go to another country that may not extradite him without assurances from India that it will not seek, impose or carry out the death penalty," the attorney argued.
 If Rana were to flee to Canada, his extradition from Canada to the US would take years and would require substantial resources by the governments of both Canada and the United States, and there is no guarantee that Canada would ultimately grant that extradition request, he said.
 However, even if Canada granted the request from the US, the terms of the US- Canada extradition treaty would prohibit the US from extraditing Rana to a third country, such as India, unless Canada granted its consent to do so, Lulejian said.
 Not only does Rana have an incentive to flee, but he has numerous international connections who can help facilitate his flight, he told the court.
 Rana ran an international immigration business for many years in Chicago, which allowed him to develop professional and personal relationships around the world.
 "Moreover, he was convicted of plotting an attack with and providing material support to an international terrorist organisation based in Pakistan. These international connections enhance Rana's flight risk because they can provide the means to flee this jurisdiction and potentially avoid extradition to India," Lulejian added.
 The 2008 Mumbai attack was one of India's most horrific terrorist attacks in which 166 people were killed and over 300 injured as 10 heavily-armed terrorists from Pakistan created mayhem.
 Pakistani national Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, the lone terrorist captured alive, was hanged to death on November 21, 2012.

Two truths from this: When we’re uncertain, we can get unnecessarily territorial, and transition is hard, even painful, no matter what your species. Also, even if you can’t sing, don’t let it stop you.
 • We at the library are transitioning from statewide shutdown to our next phase in which we offer expanded curbside pickup services to our community. Many of you are already taking advantage of this much-needed “turn of the spigot,” and it’s great to see you again. For those of you who haven’t seen the postings, here’s a review of how to do it.
 For now, please go to our website, centenniallibrary.org, to view what's available via our card catalog (KOHA). Then, please contact us at info@centenniallibrary.org with your name, phone number and a list (titles, authors, item types) of your requests. If you do not have computer access, please call 888-3853 and leave us a voicemail with your name and phone number. We will call you back.
 When your order is ready, we will call you to arrange a pickup time and place your bagged, labeled order outside the library at the appointed time. All materials have been quarantined and sanitized. With the pending restart of our statewide consortium’s interlibrary loan services and restored capability to place holds, our patrons accustomed to using KOHA in this way may soon do so again. We are also scheduling expanded staffing hours and will announce corresponding curbside options in the coming weeks.
 • For the tragicomic portion of this column, our long-awaited website, while finally completed, experienced some growing pains; hence, the temporary one you might have seen in its place at
 centenniallibrary.org. We look forward to its restoration, which is taking some repeated dragon-battling and a bit of IT magic.
 Meanwhile, you can still access our card catalog, ListenUp!Vermont and Vermont Online Library via this address. We eagerly await a “happily ever after” to this saga as well.
 • We are also gearing up for summer, which means our Summer Reading Program for all ages.
 Haven’t we lived through some epic, narrative-worthy drama this year? It makes the annual Summer Reading Program theme, “Imagine Your Story,” both poignant and bittersweet. Since it’s one of our all-time favorites, we have been looking forward to it for a solid year, and now all libraries are constrained by circumstances to limit their direct services.
 But we will turn this would-be tragic narrative into a tale of triumph and community resilience, won’t we? While we mourn the necessity of canceling our in-person summer programming this year, and will miss seeing all of you at our events, we will be offering virtual programming and summer-long reading tracker kits for all ages, with great incentives (prizes — yes, for you too, grownups, after their popularity last year) and interactive fun, extending through the first week of August.

_It is forcing America to face all its interrelated flaws — racism, poverty, militarism and materialism. It is exposing evils that are rooted deeply in the whole structure of our society. It reveals systemic rather than superficial flaws and suggests that radical reconstruction of society itself is the real issue to be faced._
 Our society was built on the racial segmentation of personhood. Some people were full humans, guaranteed non-enslavement, secured from expropriation and given the protection of law, and some people — Blacks, Natives and other nonwhites — were not. That unequal distribution of personhood was an economic reality as well. It shaped your access to employment and capital; determined whether you would be doomed to the margins of labor or given access to its elevated ranks; marked who might share in the bounty of capitalist production and who would most likely be cast out as disposable.
 In our society, in other words, the fight for equal personhood can’t help but also be a struggle for economic justice. And what we see, past and present, is how that fight against the privileges and distinctions of race can also lay the foundations for a broader assault on the privileges and distinctions of class.
 As soon as the Civil War came to a close, it was clear there could be no actual freedom for the formerly enslaved without a fundamental transformation of economic relations. “We must see that the freedman are established on the soil, and that they may become proprietors,” Charles Sumner, the Radical Republican senator from Massachusetts, wrote in March 1865. “The great plantations, which have been so many nurseries of the rebellion, must be broken up, and the freedmen must have the pieces.” Likewise, said the Radical Republican congressman Thaddeus Stevens in September 1865, “The whole fabric of Southern society must be changed, and never can it be done if this opportunity is lost.” The foundations of their institutions, he continued, “must be broken up and re-laid, or all of our blood and treasure have been spent in vain.”
 Presidential Reconstruction under Andrew Johnson, a Democrat, would immediately undermine any means to this end, as he restored defeated Confederates to citizenship and gave them free rein to impose laws, like the Black Codes, which sought to reestablish the economic and social conditions of slavery. But Republicans in Congress were eventually able to wrest control of Reconstruction from the administration, and just as importantly, Black Americans were actively taking steps to secure their political freedom against white reactionary opposition. Working through the Union Army, postwar Union Leagues and the Republican Party, freed and free Blacks worked toward a common goal of political equality. And once they secured something like it, they set out to try as much as possible to affect that economic transformation.
 “Public schools, hospitals, penitentiaries, and asylums for orphans and the insane were established for the first time or received increased funding,” the historian Eric Foner wrote in “Reconstruction: America’s Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877.” “South Carolina funded medical care for poor citizens, and Alabama provided free legal counsel for indigent defendants.”
 For Blacks and Radical Republicans, Reconstruction was an attempt to secure political rights for the sake transforming the entire society. And its end had as much to do with the reaction of property and capital owners as it did with racist violence. “The bargain of 1876,” W.E.B. Du Bois wrote in “Black Reconstruction in America,”
 _was essentially an understanding by which the Federal Government ceased to sustain the right to vote of half of the laboring population of the South, and left capital as represented by the old planter class, the new Northern capitalist, and the capitalist that began to rise out of the poor whites, with a control of labor greater than in any modern industrial state in civilized lands._

I thought I was fairly socially conscious and educated about racism for most of my life, having been raised that way. However, I recognize that I have a long way to go.

El director de los Mossos d'Esquadra, Albert Batlle, ha presentado su dimisión ante el nuevo conseller de Interior, Joaquim Forn, a dos meses y medio de la fecha anunciada por el Gobierno catalán para la celebración del referéndum de independencia del 1-O, según han informado fuentes policiales. Batlle, un ex alto cargo del tripartito que siempre ha defendido que los Mossos d'Esquadra deben ser políticamente neutrales e imparciales y que la policía catalana debe cumplir y hacer cumplir la ley, ha renunciado al cargo de director político de la policía catalana, al que accedió el 10 de junio de 2014, en sustitución de Manel Prat. En un mensaje remitido a todos los agentes del cuerpo anunciando su dimisión, Batlle se muestra convencido de que "en los actuales momentos de la vida del país", en el que el gobierno catalán plantea un referéndum de independencia para el 1-O, la policía catalana "seguirá perseverando" en su "misión de defensa de la seguridad y del bienestar" de los ciudadanos. "Y lo hará, como siempre, con escrupuloso respeto y sujeción a la ley", agrega el hasta ahora director de los Mossos, que sigue los pasos del exconseller Jordi Jané, que dejó el gobierno catalán el pasado viernes. En su despedida, Batlle muestra su agradecimiento a todo el personal de la Dirección General, a los mandos y a todos los miembros de los Mossos d'Esquadra por su "abnegada entrega a la misión que tienen encomendada al servicio del pueblo de Cataluña". Además, agradece en el escrito la confianza que depositó el gobierno catalán al nombrarle, a la que espera haber correspondido con "dedicación y lealtad". Horas después de asumir el cargo de conseller de Interior, Forn garantizó el pasado viernes que los Mossos facilitarán que el referéndum que el Govern planea para el 1 de octubre se desarrolle "con normalidad", como hacen a su juicio las policías de todo el mundo en una jornada electoral. Al día siguiente, Forn, que a diferencia de Jané es un conseller nítidamente independentista, desveló que ya había hablado con Batlle, a quien sectores de ERC y la CUP veían con reticencias al dudar de su compromiso con el proceso soberanista, y que no descartaba hacer cambios en la estructura de su departamento. De hecho, a siete días de la consulta del 9N de 2014, Batlle remitió un escrito a todos los agentes de los Mossos d'Esquadra en el que les recordaba su obligación de "actuar con neutralidad política e imparcialidad", incluso cuando estuvieran fuera de servicio, ante los "acontecimientos políticos y sociales" que vive Cataluña. Nacido en Barcelona en 1953 y licenciado en derecho por la Universidad de Barcelona, Batlle fue concejal socialista de deportes en el Ayuntamiento de Barcelona y secretario general de Servicios Penitenciarios durante el gobierno tripartito, integrado por PSC, ERC e ICV, que llegó al cargo procedente de la Oficina Antifraude de Cataluña (OAC), desde donde 2011 ejerció como director adjunto. La trayectoria de Batlle, abogado de profesión, ha estado ligada al PSC desde que en 1983 inició su trayectoria política como concejal del Ayuntamiento de Barcelona, donde se dio a conocer especialmente como concejal de deportes, aunque también ejerció labores de urbanismo, turismo, servicios funerarios, educación y servicios sociales. Con la llegada en 2003 del tripartito a la Generalitat, tras 23 años de gobierno de Jordi Pujol (CiU), Batlle saltó al otro lado de la plaza de Sant Jaume, donde fue nombrado secretario de Servicios Penitenciarios, Rehabilitación y Justicia juvenil, órgano adscrito al departamento de Justicia. En septiembre de 2011, Batlle fue nombrado subdirector de la Oficina Antifraude de Cataluña (OAC), en la que se ha mantuvo hasta su nombramiento como director de los Mossos d'Esquadra, donde se incorporó cuando el conseller era el democristiano Ramon Espadaler.

England captain Joe Root says his batsmen must prepare well if they are to get on top of a "formidable" West Indies bowling attack in the three-Test series starting next month in Southampton.
 The Windies are banking heavily on their pace attack in England to defend the Wisden Trophy, claining it after winning 2-1 on home soil in the 2019 series.
 Root said England could not afford to lower their guard against an attack which featured captain Jason Holder, Kemar Roach and Shannon Gabriel - among the top 20 in official Test rankings.
 "We are very aware of the skill West Indies have and what they will bring to this series," Root told BBC Sport.
 "One thing that stood out was how formidable their bowling attack can be. It is really important we prepare well and we are ready for all of that."
 Holder is also the top-ranked Test allrounder, followed by England's Ben Stokes, and West Indies head coach Phil Simmons has predicted their rivalry will light up the series.

BOONE - On Friday, the Boone Chamber of Commerce announced the cancellation of this year's Pufferbilly DaysTM festival due to a number of factors including guidance from the Boone County Board of Health, according to a release.
   
 "In attempting to stay on course for the 2020 Pufferbilly DaysTM festival it was our hope and intention to provide a "light at the end of the tunnel", a degree of normalcy, and an opportunity for the citizens of Boone County to finally get out and enjoy what makes our area special," the Boone Chamber of Commerce wrote in a release on Friday.
   
 "In arriving at this difficult decision today, we believe that the challenge to provide a safe and fun environment is unattainable, financially unfeasible, and would leave our loyal festival-goers too vulnerable to the transmission of the coronavirus."
   
 According to the release, the decision to cancel the festival came as a result of "a number of factors," the Boone County Chamber of Commerce noted:Guidance from the Boone County Board of Health indicating current case numbers have not declined "to the levels previously expected," and the potential of a surge due to outside visitors for the Farm Progress Show and the IMCA Supernationals events.Two of Pufferbilly DaysTM festival buildings are currently being utilized for drive-up COVID-19 testing by Boone County Public Health, and the festival is "committed to their continued use in this manner."Event registration is "far behind for this time of the year."Difficulty in obtaining "enough volunteers to staff key locations for each of the planned Pufferbilly DaysTM activities," creating difficulties in operating events.
   
 "The Pufferbilly DaysTM Steering Committee sincerely appreciates the many hours and dedication from its event chairs and other volunteers in preparing for the 2020 celebration and plans to be back strong in 2021," according to the release.

It was extraordinary. But like a killer whale, the Raptor needs a lot of ocean to feed, and southern California — or the Baja peninsula — is a long way to go to stretch the big Ford’s legs. Gladiator Mojave aims to bring those pleasures closer to home.
 Unlike the Raptor, the new Gladiator doesn’t have a new engine or get-outta- the-way bodywork. But it did feature Jeep’s throaty 285-horse V-6 and a unique hood scoop that sets it apart from brother Rubicon pickup. More important, it is raised an inch above Rubicon with trusty Fox performance shocks.
 I shifted the Mojave’s transfer case to four-wheel drive, turned traction- control off and nailed the V-6 across the Mounds’ open, northwest trails. This is terrain where the dirt bikers like to open it up, and I picked up speed quickly, the Fox shocks absorbing the trail’s imperfections.
 This might be hairy stuff in the ginormous Raptor, but the Mojave was in its element. A 75-degree left-hander loomed, and I slowed — then slewed it sideways across a water-filled dip. Gladiator’s dimensions allowed me to rotate the pickup beautifully, then I was back on the throttle as the big, 33-inch knobby tires sprayed the cabin with water.
 Good thing I kept the doors on.
 When you’re not splashing through Mother Nature at high speed, you can remove the doors and roof of the Mojave just like the Rubicon to get closer to nature. Just don’t wear your dinner clothes.

Simms was arrested again and detained pending a hearing.
 The U.S. Pre-Trial Services Office reported Simms had violated at least three court-imposed conditions, Conroy noted at a recent hearing.
 The office wrote Simms failed to report to a Pre-Trial Services Officer as directed, failed to follow through on drug rehab and counseling and failed to submit to drug testing as requested by the pre-trial officer, Conroy said.
 At the hearing Simms admitted the three violations through one of her retained defense lawyers, Norman Blais.
 Simms had initially asked for a defense lawyer at taxpayer expense but was denied when Conroy was told her assets included an estimated $1.5 million in stocks and bonds.
 Conroy told Simms her failure to follow court orders meant she would remain in prison to await her drug trafficking trial in Burlington.
 Fuller, who serves as the Violent Crime Coordinator in the U.S. Attorney’s Office, has maintained that Simms is a danger to the community, has a drug problem and needs to remain behind bars.
 Simms tested positive for cocaine, fentanyl amphetamines and methamphetamines in her system following her March arrest, officials said.
 She also is the owner of a high-profile Stonehedge North Condominium that has been the focus of several drug investigations in recent years, South Burlington Police said. The condo, which is just off the South Burlington Recreation Path, was the site of numerous drug-related complaints from neighbors and was eventually damaged by fire. The unit is currently boarded up.
 Simms has pleaded not guilty to the federal drug trafficking charge. Authorities targeted Simms immediately after the homicide in Jeffersonville when investigators learned she had driven the shooter – then known only as “Tee” – to the scene.
 State court records show Simms was present when then shooter, later identified as Taylor Ruffin Herrington, 34, of Philadelphia, fired multiple shots into a duplex at 96 Hillside Drive in Jeffersonville about 3 a.m. on March 3.

In the discussions related to Covid-19 with the faculty members of medical colleges, doctors and other medical experts, Gehlot said the state government's objective is to bring down the mortality rate due to the disease. He said the medical fraternity has played an important role in controlling the spread of coronavirus in the state.

James McDonald has ended a tough week on a triumphant note, becoming the first jockey in more than a decade to ride a century of Sydney winners in successive seasons.
 McDonald had to wait until the final event to land the milestone, riding a measured race to win aboard Godolphin three-year-old Kordia.
 The last jockey to rack up 100 metropolitan winners in consecutive seasons was Hall of Famer Darren Beadman, who as assistant trainer for Godolphin, fittingly helped provide McDonald's century.
 McDonald also extended his premiership lead over Nash Rawiller to more than 20 and looks to have back-to-back championship titles in the bag despite an upcoming three-week suspension.
 "It has been really good fun fighting it out with Nash, we were going toe-to- toe for a while," McDonald said.
 "I have been lucky enough with the support I have had the whole season, not just the last few months but the whole season.
 "I have been rewarded with some really exciting wins."
 Beadman rode more than a century of winners five seasons in a row between 2002-2007 and said it was no easy feat.
 He achieved it when he was at the peak of his powers in his mid-30s and had the backing of leading trainer John Hawkes.
 He said McDonald's effort to manage it in his 20s during one of the most competitive eras in Sydney racing reflected the young rider's horsmanship and focus.
 "You've got to stay in play, you've got to remain focused and you've got to be mentally strong to be able to do it," Beadman said.
 "You've got to live, eat and breathe racing and you've got to have good support behind you, which I did with 'Hawkesy' and a lot of other trainers as well.
 "It's a challenge if you want it."
 It was a happy end to a difficult week in which McDonald was issued a running and handling charge by stewards for showing a lack of vigour and purpose aboard beaten favourite Threeood at Randwick last Saturday.
 He was suspended for three weeks with the penalty to begin on Sunday week.
 McDonald has indicated he will appeal the ban.

Taking a cue from the movie ‘Drishyam’, Sharada, wife of Anand, and her paramour Babu, from Saligrama town in Mysuru district’s K.R. Nagar taluk, hoped to evade the long arm of the law after committing a murder. But, they soon realised the difference between real life and reel life.
 Police said Sharada, who had had enough of her husband Anand’s allegedly routine torture in a drunken state, conspired with Babu to eliminate him and live with Babu for the rest of her life.
 On the night of June 22, Babu invited Anand to his farmhouse on the outskirts of Saligrama for a party. After consuming alcohol, Babu allegedly hit him on the head with a sharp weapon, killing him. He then put the body in a sack containing grass, loaded it onto his motorcycle and rode to a temple along the Chunchankatte-Saligrama main road. He threw the body near an electricity transformer at the spot before returning with Anand’s motorcycle and placing it near the body in such a way that it would appear that Anand had died in a road mishap.
 When Anand’s body, with a wound on the head and blood stain all over the clothes, was found on June 23 morning, Anand’s father Krishne Gowda suspected foul play. He immediately lodged a complaint with the police, who took up investigation.
 Sharada and Babu were in an illicit relationship for the last few months and had hatched a plot to kill Anand. Police said the accused were inspired by the 2015 suspense thriller Drishyam to evade arrest. But, it was not to be.

England batsmen must prepare well if they are to get the better of a "formidable" West Indies bowling attack in the three-test series next month, captain Joe Root has said.
 West Indies will be banking heavily on their pace attack in England to defend the Wisden Trophy which they won after triumphing 2-1 on home soil in the 2019 series.
 Root said England could not afford to lower their guard against an attack which featured three bowlers - Jason Holder, Kemar Roach and Shannon Gabriel - who are among the top 20 in official test rankings.
 "We are very aware of the skill West Indies have and what they will bring to this series," Root told BBC Sport.
   
   
 "One thing that stood out was how formidable their bowling attack can be. It is really important we prepare well and we are ready for all of that."
 Holder is also the top ranked test all-rounder, followed by England's Ben Stokes, and West Indies head coach Phil Simmons has predicted their rivalry would light up the series.
 "Jase is one of the most well-respected guys in international cricket," Root said.
 "He took the job at a young age and we are starting to see him at the peak of his career.
 "He comes across as a very good bloke. I am looking forward to chatting to him from a social distance."
 Root has said he would miss the series opener in Southampton from July 8 should it clash with the birth of his second child with vice-captain Stokes taking the reins in his absence.
 Manchester hosts the last two tests of the series which will be played behind closed doors in a bio-secure environment.

KINGSTON - After deciding to skip her sophomore season of high school hockey to play junior hockey, Alyssa Murphy seemingly had little reason to return to the Whitman-Hanson/Silver Lake team in the following year. The Panthers hadn't won a single game in her absence. But she came back anyway, motivated by the opportunity to rejoin her friends.
 "I really missed the experience you get from playing high school sports and hanging out with my friends," she said. "Junior hockey is not quite the same. But junior hockey definitely helped my speed and my quickness, and shaped me into a better player."
 With Murphy as their captain and catalyst, the Panthers reached the state tournament this winter. A three-time Patriot League all-star, Murphy scored 32 goals last season and ended her career with 78 goals and 124 points.
 "She was one of the best players in our league," Head Coach Kevin Marani said. "She has a cannon of a shot, is a great stick-handler, a strong skater and a great leader. She's just a coach's dream."
 Murphy, who attended Silver Lake, called her final game with the Panthers "so emotional" and was thrilled to help them reach the state tournament. "We had to win two of our final three games to get into the tournament, and we were all on the same page. Everyone was so motivated," she said.
 "She just carried us on her back every game," Marani said. "Every team knew that if they shut her down, they had a pretty good chance of beating us, and she would just fight through it."
 It had long been her dream to play for the Panthers. Murphy remembers helping her parents raise money for the upstart program when she was in middle school. "I always loved hockey and I always wanted to play in high school," she said.
 As team captain the past two years, she took her role seriously. "I just tried to influence the younger players," she said. "We had a large group of younger kids on our team, and with just a couple of seniors, it was very important to step up and show them what to do in the future."
 Murphy was also a league all-star midfielder on the Silver Lake lacrosse team last spring, and she will play both sports at Western New England University in Springfield. A National Honor Society student who plans on studying engineering, she is confident she'll be able to balance academics and athletics.
 "I talked to graduates from Western New England and they said that it's manageable at the Division 3 level," she said. "It's definitely going to be a lot of work, but I'm good at time management skills. I'm up for it."

I am looking forward to chatting to him from a social distance."Root has said he would miss the series opener in Southampton from July 8 should it clash with the birth of his second child with vice-captain Stokes taking the reins in his absence.Manchester hosts the last two tests of the series which will be played behind closed doors in a bio-secure environment.

PRATT-Every year, teams of wheat harvest crews come to Kansas to bring in the harvest from the nation's bread basket. Crews come to Kansas from states like Texas, Nebraska, Colorado to Iowa, North Dakota, Kansas and even Canada. Many crews make their way down U.S. Highway 281 through Pratt in May as harvest starts in Texas then move their way up through Oklahoma and into Kansas to spread out and bring in the wheat.
   
 Last week Greg and Sandy Beck, a husband and wife crew from Malcolm, Iowa, along with their constant companion "Tug" a miniature pincer started their harvest run in Pratt. When done in Pratt County they will head for the Jetmore area, then move north to Hermingford Neb. and end their run in either South Dakota or North Dakota, depending on the weather, Sandy said.
   
 Making the harvest run is relatively new for the Becks. They started in 2013 and stayed in South Dakota and North Dakota.Their children were grown and out of the house so they decided to give harvesting a try, Greg said.
   
 Outside of harvest, Sandy is an operations manufacturer for a soybean company. She produces many soybean based products including bread, handle bars, glass cleaner, grease cleaner, wheels for fork lifts and roller coasters and more. Greg manufactures pallets.
   
 Before becoming custom harvesters, they raised a lot of pigs. For a time, they were selling 1,000 head a week. The family did all the work with hardly any outside help. They also had crops and raised cattle in Iowa.
   
 Finding customers has always been the hardest part of the job. They used to start their harvest run in Vernon, Texas. But over the years, their customers in Texas were gone. One customer died, another switched to livestock and another planted everything to grass. So they decided to start in Kansas and not deal with finding new customers.
   
 The Becks started this years harvest in Pratt on June 15, working for Gary Barker. Harvest was going pretty good with moisture at 12 percent and wheat at 63 pounds a bushel with the benchmark at 60 pounds. Recent rain storms have caused delays in finishing cutting wheat.
   
 Greg said he loves farming and enjoys meeting the people along the way. That is why he likes going on the harvest run.
   
 "It gets in your blood. Every year its different," Greg said. "It's just something that grows on you."

La primera pugna por la custodia de una niña, hija de una pareja lesbomaternal queretana está por resolverse en la Suprema Corte en un litigio en el que están involucrados los derechos de la pequeña para que cuente con un entorno familiar identificable y estable.
 Tras acordarlo con su concubina, Ana se sometió a un tratamiento de inseminación artificial del cual nació su hija. Ana y Lesly se casaron al mes siguiente en la Ciudad de México, era mayo del 2014. Su relación se mantuvo con altibajos hasta que por diversos motivos decidieron ponerle fin, dos años después de contraer matrimonio
 La custodia de la pequeña quedó en manos de Lesly, motivo por el cual Ana llevó el conflicto a tribunales en busca de obtener la patria potestad y custodia de su hija.
 Esto luego de los incumplimientos por parte de Lesly del convenio al régimen de visitas y convivencias.
 Registros judiciales indican que la menor tiene una mayor identificación con Lesly, de manera que un cambio de guarda y custodia, lejos de beneficiar a la menor, le perjudicaría, sobre todo porque Lesly tiene otros dos hijos, a quienes la niña identifica como sus hermanos.
 Por ello se alega que el cambio de guarda y custodia sería perjudicial para la menor, pues no sólo sería separada de Lesly, sino también de sus hermanos, cambiando por completo su entorno familiar, situación que también afectará a los otros dos niños.
 “No resulta válido que la quejosa argumente que la custodia se le debió haber concedido a ella, por el hecho de ser la madre biológica de la citada menor, pues como ya se vio, en la comaternidad, no es el lazo biológico lo que determina la filiación con una de las madres, sino la voluntad procreacional”, señala una propuesta de sentencia en la Suprema Corte.
 Para el ministro Jorge Pardo no se puede considerar que en un caso de comaternidad, como este, el lazo biológico con una de las madres sea suficiente para determinar la guarda y custodia de un menor.

SPRINGFIELD -- As the Black Lives Matter protests continue in Illinois and throughout the nation, many observers have noticed something that sets the current wave of demonstrations apart from those of previous generations -- widespread participation of people of all races, including white people.
   
 That has been true of many demonstrations in Illinois, including those held in predominantly white communities.
   
 State Rep. Tom Demmer, a Republican from Dixon, represents the 90th House District in northwest Illinois. Dixon is the county seat of Lee County which, according to Census Bureau estimates, is nearly 92% white. His district also includes parts of Ogle, DeKalb and LaSalle counties --all predominantly white as well.
   
 When video circulated last month of an unarmed Black man, George Floyd, being killed at the hands of a white Minneapolis police officer, Demmer said even people in his rural, largely white House district were outraged.
   
 "And I think people have rightly been looking for a way to express some solidarity," he said. "And also, to express that, you know, that kind of thing is not and shouldn't be tolerated or accepted in the United States of America. And so, I think it's been pretty positive to see some of the reaction of people standing up and saying that kind of thing is just not permissible."
   
 Demmer spoke to Capitol News Illinois for its "Perspectives on Progress" series, a collection of conversations about race that until now has focused on the voices of Black leaders and members of the Legislative Black Caucus.
   
 One of the things those leaders have stressed is that the issue of racial injustice in America isn't just about one instance of police brutality, or even a long string of such instances stretching back for centuries in American history. They argue it's a structural problem that reaches into every aspect of American life, from housing and education and job opportunities to access to health care and investment capital for businesses.
   
 Many of them also say that when they return to Springfield for the fall veto session in November, they plan to propose legislation to address those inequities and hope their colleagues, including Republicans, will listen.
   
 Demmer serves as the Deputy House Minority Leader, thereby making him the second-highest ranking Republican in the House. Demmer said he agrees that the problem is more pervasive than a group of isolated incidents, and that he and his GOP colleagues are willing to listen to reform discussions.
   
 "I'm not going to come into this and say that I've got the answers for this," he said. "I mean, I want to be in a position of listening to the suggestions and the solutions that are offered by many of my colleagues and the Black and Latino caucuses -- my colleagues who have been personally touched by this, who see this in a very pronounced way in their districts. I think an appropriate role right now is for us to listen and to be supportive of, you know, things that our colleagues are telling us would improve the situation in their districts and, more broadly, in the entire state of Illinois."
   
 In particular, Demmer said he wants to hear ideas about ways to bring more investment into communities of color.
   
 "I think that's definitely an area that that I'm interested in and can be supportive of is trying to provide that spark, in some cases towards turning around the economic downturn or the pressures and the tide that have been pulling against these kind of new investments and new opportunities in those communities," he said. "I certainly think that's a big piece of the puzzle, is trying to provide more and higher quality opportunities for people who live and work in some of these communities who have been hardest hit by so much of this economic strife for decades."
   
 One of the things Demmer said he and his colleagues will be more reluctant to endorse, however, is the call that has been heard in many demonstrations to "defund the police."
   
 It's a phrase that may mean different things to different people -- some say it simply means shifting resources from policing to human services, such as mental health care, and economic development while others say it's a call to completely reinvent the idea of policing and law enforcement.
   
 "I think that it's not, as some people have tried to paint this, this stark contrast between either supporting the status quo and everything that's happening with police today, or defund the police and abolish police departments," he said. "I mean, you've seen everything across that spectrum. And I really don't think that that either of those alternatives is appropriate."
   
 "We saw just this past weekend in Chicago, over 100 people were shot in one weekend," he added. "This shows that there's a widespread problem with violence. Police officers have a role to play, and do so in many, many communities all around the country and around the world, in promoting public safety and a huge number of incidences. Now, it doesn't mean that we should, you know, look the other way when people abuse that position. But I certainly think that the concept that's been talked about in some parts of the country about eliminating police departments I think is a fundamentally wrong message and wrong solution to take out of this problem."
   
 Demmer said he is willing to look at a number of ways to reform policing in Illinois, such as licensing police officers and working legislatively to refine the concept of "qualified immunity," which often makes it difficult for victims of police brutality to sue for damages. But more than anything, he said he wants to hear ideas from people whose communities would be most affected.
   
 "You know, honestly, I think I am open and want to listen and be supportive (of) some folks who have personal experience…and have more direct interaction in their districts with the kinds of steps that could be taken that would improve the credibility and the relationship between communities and the police officers that serve them," he said.
   
 Demmer's full interview, along with other episodes in the "Perspectives on Progress" series are available on the Capitol News Illinois website.

In response to the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Rayshard Brooks, law enforcement has come under increased scrutiny across the country.
   
 Mass protests calling for racial equity have occurred throughout the U.S., and even in Holland.
   
 Ottawa County Sheriff Steve Kempker said he believes while the county has held high training standards previously, his department is prepared to continue working to improve and maintain relationships.
   
 "I think between us, Holland and Zeeland (departments), we all have extremely good relationships and contacts within our communities that we use every day."
   
 Kempker pointed to Ottawa County's involvement in ALPACT -- Advocates and Leaders for Police and Community Trust -- as well as the creation of the county's office as Diversity, Equity and Inclusion as positive developments in working for equitable policies.
   
 During the Ottawa County board of commissioners meeting on Tuesday, June 23, county DEI Director Robyn Afrik told the board the DEI office is working with Kempker to develop community trust, particularly with minority communities in Ottawa County.
   
 "You can imagine as (the killing of) George Floyd has caused more urgency around (community-police relations), you can be assured we are having those conversations," Afrik said.
   
 Ottawa County joined ALPACT in 2015. The county's DEI office launched in 2019.
   
 "It's just not something that's going to start up overnight," Kempker said. "A lot of the key people are already in place from when we first started ALPACT, to get us back at the table and work on different aspects.
   
 "And as we move forward, It's going to be a huge benefit not only for law enforcement, but I think for all of our county departments and the county overall as a whole."
   
 In the aftermath of Black Lives Matter protests and calls for more stringent training, Kempker said OSCO is prepared to increase de-escalation training, although he believes deputies already have a strong base from which to build.
   
 "We told our staff that we are going through, again, reviews of policies and procedures," he said.
   
 "We are a community policing agency. We've never gone away from that philosophy. That has been the success of this organization -- hiring good people, extensive training.
   
 "We know there's changes ahead as far as some federal laws (on policing) and probably more training on top of the training that we do already. But again, I think we were well ahead of the curve here. We sat down and looked at a lot of the things that legislators are recommending or what other agencies have implemented, we're already there."
   
 At the federal level, there are multiple packages of legislation that aim at improving police-community relations. These bills include provisions to hire more community-based officers, increase de-escalation training and ban the use of chokeholds.

 Last Monday, public gatherings of up to 1,000 people were allowed, up from 500. Trade fairs were given the green light and pools, zoos, museums and castles were allowed to return to normal operations, with no more limits on visitor numbers.

Additionally, home loan rates are nearing their record lows following the RBI's decision to cut the repo rate on multiple occasions in the recent past which will lead to lower EMIs for some time. In such a situation, you first need to take stock of your finances and your requirements and see whether you can make certain changes in your plan. For example, you may decide to delay your plans by a few more months to get better deals on properties. You may also consider going for a smaller, hence, cheaper, property to reduce your overall loan burden and out-of-pocket expenses. By doing so, you may also be able to avail of the upfront interest subsidy on your loan through the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana scheme, get additional tax deduction benefit under section 80EEA of the I-T Act (if your property is valued less than Rs. 45 lakh), and save more in stamp duty and registration charges.

 The Ducks actually jumped out to a 1-0 lead in the top of the first inning and the energy in their dugout was off the charts. But Gillette answered right back, as senior Hayden Sylte scored the game's first run in the bottom of the first off an RBI single from Powell.

 Additional Chief Secretary, Medical and Health, Rohit Kumar Singh said the ICMR is sending 200 test kits to Rajasthan for the trial.
 Gehlot said this will help ramp up coronavirus investigation infrastructure and get quick reports.

 Lewis also offered three main pointers for designers to consider when crafting their stories. First, begin with the audience in mind. Think about what information needs to be shown so that you are the one shaping the argument. Second, it’s important to represent yourself, inject a bit of your personality into your representations, and be proud of what you’re sharing. It’s great to use other designers for inspiration, but make sure that your work speaks to your interest and represents your voice. Lewis noted that her personal inspiration comes from a variety of colors and typefaces. Last, lose the idea of grouping similar drawings together, and instead think about the structure of the narrative. Arguments usually need more than one type of drawing to make a case, so don’t hesitate to mix things up even if it initially feels out of order.

While most Kentuckians understand that personalities are critical to a well- rounded understanding of history, the commonwealth’s new academic standards for public schools drastically diminish the attention given to individual contributions of great Americans and Kentuckians of the past, including most of those represented by the remaining statues.
 Such an approach to teaching history increases the likelihood that the significant impact of these heroes on our nation’s founding and development will get lost in bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo that only covers depersonalized events and vague concepts rather than specific — often sacrificial — contributions made by individuals.
 Ironically, though Lincoln’s statue remains in the Capitol, his name and individual life story are absent from the commonwealth’s new social studies standards, which are supposed to cover material — including history — our students are expected to know in order to obtain a complete and quality education.
 How can you have standards in Kentucky that don’t even mention the name of the 16th president, who guided the nation through its most tumultuous history?
 Defenders of the new standards claim it’s not necessary to mention giant contributors to understand the history they created.
 Really?
 Imagine a governor trying to use such a line of inane reasoning while having Lincoln’s statue hauled out of the Capitol.

 Posted on Reddit on June 27, the video is 5 seconds long. The post's caption reads, "Neighborhood cat decided to hop into the stroller during our walk this evening".
 The recording shows a tangerine furred feline curled up on the lower level of the baby stroller. As the film progresses, the kitty looks around casually. The cat seems to be enjoying the free ride along the block it has hitched with its neighbours. Probably the best part about the clip is how unfazed the feline appears to be about its infringement as if this is something the kitty does every day.
 Since being shared to the subreddit 'cats', the post has accumulated over 3,000 upvotes and many hilarious comments.

PLYMOUTH - Coaches want someone like Alexis Muratore as part of their program. Not only has she proven herself to be a strong athlete and a great teammate, Muratore's also something of a good luck charm.
 In 11 athletic seasons with the Panthers golf, basketball and softball teams Muratore was a part of four different league title winners as well as a South Sectional championship. And she has enjoyed every single step of it along the way.
 "I've had so much fun playing high school sports. I loved every second of it," Muratore said. "It's not just about playing the games. The things I think I'm got to remember from the last four years are the times you spent with the team and all the things you did together as a group. That's what I think high school sports are really are about.
 "Sports have always been a special part of my everyday life," Muratore said. "I love keeping busy and I've made so many of my best friends because of all the sports that I've played."
 Muratore's dipped her toes into many different sports over the years. She played lacrosse and did gymnastics as youngster and she was also a pretty strong baseball player.
 "I played a lot of sports growing up but I actually never played youth softball. I always played with South Plymouth Youth Baseball while I was growing up and then I made the switch over to softball when I was a freshman at Plymouth South," she explained.
 The experience of playing on a team made up entirely of boys helped Muratore prepare for four years as a member of the South golf program.
 "I've played golf since I was around eight and it was great to have everyone just accept me as another member of the team despite the fact that they were all boys and I'm a girl," Muratore said. "Everyone treated me like I was another member of the team and were all great teammates to me."
 Muratore did her part to make things work, too. She played some varsity matches her junior year and by her senior season she had moved up to the fifth spot in the playing order.
 "She worked hard and became a good golfer. Alexis proved she belonged as a member of the team. She's a solid golfer and a competitive person who fit in well with the team," Plymouth South Golf Head Coach Tom Hicks said. "She was a pretty consistent hitter and I always knew she was going to come back with a pretty good score after her round of golf."
 Muratore averages a 42 for a nine-hole score. Standing at 5-foot-1 she's not really a big hitter off the tee but she tries to make up for it with a consistent short game. "I can hit the ball pretty straight and my short game is okay," she said.
 Each spring for the last four years Muratore's been a big part of the Plymouth South softball program that's worked its way into being one of the top squads in the region during that time. But switching from baseball to softball had a couple of obstacles that needed to be overcome.
 "I think we had to work on her swing a little bit as a freshman but she picked up on the changes right away. She was a two-year captain for me and super- coachable as a player. Always up-beat and positive," Panthers softball coach Stephanie Finn said. "The place where she's really excelled was defensively as the starting second baseman her sophomore and junior seasons. She's quick, really strong defensively and the competitive type of a player who would do everything she could to get to every ground ball that came her way."
 "I had so many great times with the softball team," Muratore said. "Hannah Masterson and I both came in as freshmen and the older players made us feel so accepted as teammates right away. We all got along as a group so well."
 A National Honor Society and Honor Roll student, Muratore was also a member of Student Council. She will attend the Isenberg School of Management at UMass Amherst.

REVEALED: Pitchside mics uncover how Frank Lampard and Cesar Azpilicueta inspired Chelsea with a call to 'play long' to turn the tables on Man City and hand Liverpool the Premier League title

“The English-speaking K-pop fans who are getting involved in this, who are up on these issues, these are not foreigners,” said CedarBough Saeji, an academic who studies K-pop fan culture. “These are Americans.”
 “That these young, socially progressive, outward-looking people who are really adept at using these online platforms — who are stuck at home and online even more because of COVID-19 — that these people are doing political things is not surprising,” added Saeji, a visiting assistant professor of East Asian culture at Indiana University Bloomington. “These are young people who are completely willing to learn about a new culture to follow their interest in some pop- culture product. These are exactly the kind of people who are the opposite of the Trump audience that claps when he disses ‘Parasite’ and says that ‘Gone With the Wind’ is a real movie.”
 In the days since Trump’s rally in Tulsa, no evidence has emerged that South Korean fans of K-pop were involved in any significant way in the “no-show” campaign. South Korean news media instead relayed American reports from Tulsa, treating the episode mainly as a gag by teenage fans of K-pop and TikTok users in the United States.
 South Koreans tend to follow U.S. elections closely because they could affect alliance relations between Washington and Seoul and U.S. policy on North Korea. But they generally remain wary of taking sides in U.S. politics. Trump has been quite popular among liberal South Koreans, including young people, by raising hopes that his diplomacy with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Un, might produce a breakthrough in long-stalled talks on ending the North’s nuclear threat and establishing peace on the Korean Peninsula.
 On Monday, some South Koreans responded to the news from Tulsa by expressing concern about how Trump might react. “Why does K-pop meddle in an American political dispute,” wrote one reader of a local newspaper article about the rally.
 But while K-pop culture in South Korea is a largely apolitical mainstream concern, leaving fan armies to focus on boosting album sales and propping up their idols, the community’s position as a subculture in the United States may lend itself to more radical gestures, especially at a time of increased political polarization.
 “Although K-pop’s message is not necessarily political in an overt sense, they are often about empowerment and self-confidence,” said the author of the “Ask a Korean!” blog, who uses the pen name T.K. Park. “Lots of first-time K-pop fans, for example, got into BTS because the group’s message of ‘love yourself’ strongly resonated with them.” And because such content has attracted an audience made up largely of women and people of color, Park added, “this message pushes them to be more expressive with every aspect of their lives, including politics.”
 They had also already honed the necessary skills. “K-pop fans learned how to organize through their fandom,” Park said. “K-pop is a digital-native music,” he added, and South Korea’s early adoption of nationwide broadband service “made Korean pop music respond to the demands of the internet, and also made K-pop’s fandom the most sophisticated actors in the digital sphere.” He pointed to the near-constant campaigns to flood radio stations with song requests or sell out concert tickets in a matter of minutes as a training ground: “All of these activities can be translated into politics very easily.”

Longstanding projects have been ongoing despite the pandemic slowdown. Along with the development review board, the council has been meeting regularly, although all other municipal committees and boards have not. Our public works team have also been working on a limited basis, but they are now able to repair our roads and cut grass.
 The council has agreed to a three-month work plan for the replacement of the Kimball Avenue bridge. We unanimously passed a resolution, along with Winooski, requesting the Burlington International Airport’s director to apply for a federal grant to install a noise monitoring system to help inform our policy decisions.
 He has done so, and our fingers are crossed.
 We also unanimously passed a 3-month extension of Interim Zoning to allow the planning commission to resume and complete its regulatory work that will govern our remaining large swaths of open space.
 These past months have been a challenge. There is still much work to do, including our planning for recreation and energy projects.
 Together, we’ll get there.
