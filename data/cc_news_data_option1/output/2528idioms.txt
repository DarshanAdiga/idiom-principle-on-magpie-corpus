Also not present at the Zoom meeting were M Station Attorney Frank Vitolo nor any of the other M station professionals who had testified in the past five weeks.
 “We tried to do the best thing for the town,” Stanley said. This application is very important. It’s something that people are going to be looking at for decades to come, so we want to make sure that we did it properly.”
 There was only one comment in the meeting, an email read into the record from Cattano Avenue landlord Douglas Greenberger, a supporter of the plan, who said his family goes back five generations in Morristown.
 He thanked the board for “broadly and deeply questioning the world-class professionals” of M Station, noting it “connects neighborhoods and residents by texture and character,” assuring “the greatest level of success on all levels of the project.”
 Only a small handful of residents had had any questions for board members during the Zoom process. Dozens upon dozens had come out during Town Council consideration of the plan when meetings were live at Town Hall in late 2019 and early 2200. Many had supported the plan but others described negative impacts in such areas as traffic congestion, the loss of retail space and the cutting off of Third Ward residents.
 SJP Properties has plans to build two buildings totaling 352,000 square feet of office space and 32,500 square feet of retail, which would replace the Midtown Shopping Center.
 The board approved the M-Station developer's proposal for demolition of the shopping center at the Thursday, June 18 meeting. The shopping center has already been closed down.
 The East building has been leased by Deloitte, a professional services organization, contingent upon SJP receiving full municipal approvals for M Station.
 Deloitte would occupy all of the office space — floors 2 through 6 — of M Station East, which is planned to be six stories and about 120,000 square feet, including 10,000 square feet of first-floor retail space, as well as lobby and building services areas.
 M Station West is planned to be seven stories and about 253,000 square feet, which includes more than 230,000 square feet of office space and 23,000 square feet of retail, plus lobby and building services areas.
 The site also features a 50-foot promenade along Morris Street with canopy of trees, rain garden and other environmental effects to make it a "destination" attraction, according to Town Planner Phil Abramson.
 A roundabout would replace the current intersection and traffic signal at Morris Street and Spring Street.
 Designed by architecture firm Gensler in close collaboration with SJP, M Station would be Morristown’s most significant commercial development in more than 30 years, Abramson said.

If you’re used to a traditional file-and-folder-based structure for your images then library organisation with Lightroom requires a slight shift in mindset. Lightroom is capable of sorting and organising folders and files just like your operating system, but with Collections it also offers an alternative that, on the face of it, looks similar to a folder structure. But Collections o er an advantage. Think of collections like music playlists for your photos. They let you collect any group of images together without affecting file and folder locations on your drive. What’s more, unlike a normal folder an image can exist in multiple collections at once without creating several storage- hogging copies of the file. As such, after rating and filtering your favourite shots from a folder it’s a good idea to create a collection for them. From this point, you’ll only need to go back to the original folder if you ever want to look through your lesser shots, which rarely happens. So with a collection you can single out and sort the pictures that matter most then forget about the rest. In combination with keywords and ratings, collections let you reshape your image library into any structure you like, or several different structures at once.

After the initial hiccups during the lockdown period, Bigbasket is now seeing unprecedented surge in business.

"20 per cent month-on-month growth is good. Even if we continue to grow even at half that rate in the coming months, we will cross the $1 billion sales (GMV) mark," Menon said.

"So when I decided to move on from journalism to film making, I realised that it wasn’t a ‘Cakewalk’. Financiers would ask me to get a big star, a cross- section of stars who pretended to be my best friend until then disappeared overnight. Maybe they didn’t want to associate with me anymore. So when I used to meet them with scripts (initially I wanted to produce films) they would ask me to route it through their managers. Fair enough. But after making me wait for three to six months (rigorous follow ups later) they would turn down the offer. Same happened with the Bollywood studios, they would meet and ask me to get an A-list actor on board first. They didn’t care much about the content.

The normal three-plus hours of meetings that have held one a week via Zoom for the past five weeks was cut down to a virtual blink of the eye on Thursday, June 25.
 The plan itself has been more than two years in the making.
 The plan will now be moved back to the Town Council, acting as the town's redevelopment agency, that will make sure the plan abides by the town's approved redevelopment zone.
 Planning Board Attorney John Inglesino noted board professionals worked hard in the last week, “to be able to put the resolution together within the timeframe allotted for these meetings," he said.
 The resolution is 40 pages with 85 conditions of approval.
 “The conditions were circulated to the board early this week," Inglesino said. “I want to thank the members who took the time to read these conditions and provide us with feedback and input and thoughts that were really helpful.”
 The approval still needs some fine-tuning for grammar, context and resubmission of original wording on arcade overhangs on the two buildings before going back to the council, he added.
 Mayor Timothy Dougherty asked that the resolution be posted on the town's website, which has not yet occurred as of Sunday, June 28.
 “Our planners and engineers...looked under every corner and every rock and put together a package that will hold this developer accountable to do the right thing,” Dougherty said.
 Approval for the M Station resolution came from Board President Joseph Stanley and board members Martha Ballard, Hector Cardona, Mayor Timothy Dougherty, Debra Gottsleben, Joseph Kane and Richard Tighe. Stefan Armington and Susan Glover were absent.

If you’ve always found it hard to muster the energy to organise your images properly then here’s a tip – do it right at the start, before you even look through a fresh set of photos. At this moment we are all eager to start working up our photos. This is the time to be disciplined, defer the gratification and spend a few moments organising the files. It needn’t be too involved, but if you can add a few keywords Get into the habit of entering keywords at the start of the process, ideally when you import your photosLightroom’s Import dialog lets you add keywords and create collections while you import new images it will serve you well in the long run.Lightroom’s Import dialog lets you add keywords and create collections for your fresh image files while you import them, so this is an ideal place to spend a few moments on image organisation. You can also use the import dialog to download cards to your drive. This is good practice, as you can set up a folder on your drive and create a backup as well if you like. When it comes to choosing a folder structure, a simple method is to organise by date. Choose ‘Copy’ at the top of the Lightroom Import dialog, select a destination then copy all the files from your card into a folder named with the date in the format YYYY-MM- DD and perhaps a brief description, for example ‘2020-03-12-garden-birds’. Then simply add a couple of keywords and import the files.

 A recent spate of shootings in Chicago and other cities have had authorities on edge. Experts say non-suicidal gun deaths are on track to top last year. The news comes as the American public is dealing with the stress of the coronavirus pandemic and economic fallout, divisions over racial justice and policing, and heightened political divisions of a presidential election year.
 The 10-year-old girl died at a hospital after the shooting in the Logan Square neighborhood northwest of downtown around 9:40 p.m., according to police spokesman Roberto Garduno.
 Preliminary information showed the gunfire came from a group of males who had been shooting at each other on the block, he said. No one was in custody Sunday.
