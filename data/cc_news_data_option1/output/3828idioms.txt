Nesmith probably has a lower floor than any of the other top small forward prospects given that he’ll be 21 by the draft. Still, he looked quite good in his Junior year, averaging 23 points, 4.9 rebounds and 1.4 steals per game on a scorching 52.2 percent shooting from deep. Nesmith is an incredibly gifted shooter who has impressive range. His ability to catch-and-shoot and create space with fakes makes him a promising prospect – for the right team.

A federal judge Thursday urged the Trump administration to consider delaying a ban on new downloads of the popular video app TikTok and hinted he might block the government's order set to take effect on Sunday.
 Judge Carl Nichols made the comments at a hastily called telephone hearing where TikTok argued a ban, even if temporary, could cause irreparable harm to the video-sharing application with some 100 million US users.
 The judge agreed with TikTok lawyers to an expedited hearing schedule and said he would make a decision before the ban takes effect at 11:59 pm Sunday (0359 GMT Monday).
 Nichols said he disagreed with government lawyers' claims that the ban -- which would not immediately prevent usage of TikTok but prevent downloads by new users and updates -- "merely preserves the status quo."
 "I would like the government (Justice Department) to confer with its client," Nichols said.
 He asked the Justice Department lawyers to indicate by Friday if they were willing to postpone a ban; if not he would review briefs from both sides and make a ruling on TikTok's request for a temporary injunction on President Donald Trump's order.
 The Chinese-owned app -- which is wildly popular with US teenagers in particular -- has come under fire as tensions escalate between Beijing and Washington, with Trump threatening a ban if it is not sold to an American company.

“You feel the opulence. And to use an overused phrase, you go back in time,” Bier says. “Everything is just over the top, and you can see how it was in that era. It has all been brought back and is probably in better shape than maybe it was when it was built. It’s just stunning when you walk in.”
 The house has 15 bedrooms, 15 full bathrooms, and five half-bathrooms. All the bathrooms have been updated. The bedrooms are quaint and colorful, and some feature fireplaces.
 One very large and updated kitchen serves the whole castle. Many of the marble finishes were sourced from nearby Marble, Colorado.
 The dining room is huge and regal, and the living areas are intimate and comfortable, thanks to fireplaces, leather-embossed walls, and elaborate ceilings. Several Tiffany lamps in the great room were specifically designed for the castle.
 The stone fireplace in the reception room is adorned with the Osgood coat of arms—a lion holding a sheath of wheat.
 The current owners completely restored the castle from top to bottom and updated the estate’s infrastructure, including the electrical, plumbing, and heating.
 “They’ve uncovered architectural features that had been covered up. They’ve redone everything,” Bier explains.
 “Some of the rooms had fallen into disrepair from previous owners who really didn’t pay much attention to it, and [the current owners] just went through it all. And it just shines right now.”

Earlier this month, Trump cited national security concerns and issued orders to ban both the popular Chinese app WeChat -- which has been put on hold by a separate court -- and TikTok.
 But the TikTok order stops short of a full ban until November 12, giving the Chinese parent firm ByteDance time to conclude a deal to transfer ownership of the app.
 A tentative deal unveiled last weekend would make Silicon Valley giant Oracle the technology partner for TikTok and a stakeholder in a new entity to be known as TikTok Global.
 Trump has argued that TikTok and WeChat could be used by Chinese intelligence even as his critics said he offered no substantive evidence.
 \- Ban would 'cripple' TikTok -
 As part of its court filing, a statement from TikTok interim head Vanessa Pappas said a ban to take effect Sunday would be devastating for the social platform which had been surging in much of the world.
 A ban "will cause our user base to stagnate and then precipitously decline," Pappas said.
 "For TikTok to remain competitive, continued growth at this stage in our development is critical. New users are the lifeblood of a social media application like TikTok; without new users, we cannot compete with other platforms."
 She noted that until July 1, when rumors of a ban first began to circulate, TikTok was adding some 424,000 new US users each day.
 "Eliminating this influx of new US users would cripple our growth and immediately cut into our market share," she said.
 The TikTok petition also speculated that the president was retaliating because of reports the app was used by his critics to snatch up tickets to a Trump rally in Tulsa to which they had no intention of going -- an event which belly flopped with significantly fewer people in attendance.
 \- Deal in limbo -
 The status of the deal on TikTok, which would include investment from US retail giant Walmart, remained unclear as the parties awaited word on whether it would win approval in Beijing.
 ByteDance said Thursday that it had applied for an export license with the commerce ministry, although it did not specifically link the move to TikTok or any potential sale.
 China's commerce ministry published new rules in August that added "civilian use" to a list of technologies that are restricted for export and require permission, which could complicate any sale.

“There’s something wrong if people think kids are going to remember that scene later in their lives in an academic way," Clinton said.
 With experiences like that, he added, the panel’s goal is “mainly to make sure each student feels welcome, especially in an environment where being a person of color, in the overwhelming minority.”
 Clinton said his group has been talking to school board members weekly to ensure they are on board.
 “I think they're starting to realize how important these issues are,” he said.
 The issues the Panel for Equity is working on, he added, are not limited to racism but anti-bias and anti-discrimination in sexism, against the LGBTQ+ community, people with disabilities and more.
 “We’re really trying to make sure each student’s voice is heard,” Clinton said.
 The panel’s curriculum reform committee has already been collaborating with history and English teachers at Mira Costa, said Jasmine Williams, lead of the committee.
 Teachers have been sharing their syllabi with the group, she added, seeing how to introduce more inclusive voices and diverse literature, like replacing “Lord of the Flies” and “The Catcher in the Rye” with books by POC authors.
 In reaching out to teachers at Mira Costa, Ahmed said, she’s gotten feedback from many who are open to changing their curriculum, integrating more diverse topics and assignment prompts.
 “I think many of them want to make this change,” Ahmed said, “And our goal is to support and give them more resources to be able to do that.
 Members of #DiversifyourNarrative’s MBUSD chapter have been informally talking with some school board members about implementing ethnic studies curriculum among other ideas, Gedion said.
 A goal is to implement an ethnic studies class into Mira Costa’s history department as a mandatory course for freshmen, she added.
 The state Senate, in fact, recently passed a bill that makes ethnic studies courses a high school graduation requirement.
 It looks good, Gedion said, for MBUSD to get ahead of this.
 There are so many towns in which residents need to see an example of what it looks like to pick up the pieces and effect great change, Gedion added. If Manhattan Beach can be a leader in that charge, it will be a powerful message to send.
 “This really is a perfect opportunity for MBUSD to be on the forefront of equitable change,” Clinton said.
 Although starting the initiative was in reaction to recent issues of racial injustice, he added, it does not end there.
 “This should be institutionalized,” Clinton said of the groups’ efforts. “This is just the beginning. I hope we can be proactive, continue to push change to affect people who need it and work on these issues that are (possibly) not being talked about in other districts.”
 Manhattan Beach Unified is hosting a board workshop on Equity, Diversity, Social Justice, and Inclusion at 4:30 p.m. on Wednesday, Sept. 30, according to a district spokesperson. The workshop will be live streamed on YouTube.
 While there's an urgency on the part of the student and community groups to diversifying Manhattan Beach Unified classrooms, there’s no timeline to meet a final goal.
 “Education reform doesn't stop, (we) won't ever stop,” Williams said. “The work we’re doing, we’re in it for the long haul.

“That’s what’s so crazy about somebody cheating in these events like this, because there is not a lot of money involved,” he said. “For them to cheat and do what they did, the risk they took, for the recognition and a piece of wood, a trophy or plaque on the wall, is pretty ridiculous.”
 The fishermen, Robert Dennett and Kamron Wootton, were among the anglers competing in a two-day largemouth bass fishing tournament on Lake Powell in October 2018, according to the Utah wildlife division. A $2,500 prize would be awarded to the team that turned in the five fish with the highest total weight.
 The event had about 25 teams and takes place several times a year.
 The bass the men had turned in put them in second place after the first day of the tournament, and gave them the prize of the overall biggest fish.
 But the bass that Dennett and Wootton presented didn’t look like the others, Lt. Paul Washburn, a spokesman for the wildlife resources division, said Tuesday.
 Two things struck tournament officials about the fish, he said. “One, they were shaped differently, indicating that they probably have a different diet,” he said. “And then also they had some markers of stress” — a reddish color in the fishes' mouth and on the fins.
 The fish prompted tournament officials to call a biologist and the wildlife resources division, which sent an investigator for the second day of the tournament. There, the men were questioned, Washburn said.
 “Neither one of them were very inclined to talk to our investigator,” he said. “One of them started to kind of acknowledge that yeah, the fish maybe hadn’t come from Lake Powell. Then he very quickly asked for an attorney, and the other individual didn’t want to say anything.”
 Dennett and Wootton’s lawyer, Douglas Terry, could not be reached for comment Tuesday.
 The wildlife resources division had the bass tested at a University of Utah lab. Researchers were able to determine where the fish had originated by comparing the amount of strontium isotopes found naturally in the lakes to the strontium isotopes in an otolith, a particular part of a fish’s ear. An otolith, Washburn said, has a high concentration of calcium and is sensitive to any changes in the chemistry of the water.
 In May 2019, after months of waiting, the lab was able to say unequivocally that the fish that Dennett and Wootton turned in could not have come from Lake Powell, based on the level of isotopes in the otolith scale of the fish, Washburn said. The wildlife agency eventually learned that the men had been fishing at Quail Creek Reservoir, about 180 miles west, just before the Lake Powell tournament.
 On March 18, Dennett and Wootton were charged with tampering to influence a contest, a third-degree felony; unlawful release of wildlife, a Class A misdemeanor; and captivity of protected wildlife, a Class B misdemeanor. Last month, both men pleaded guilty to all three counts.

 “It’s good decorating that makes it look really nice. It has an open concept, tall ceilings, spiral staircase,” Blazer says. “Then the kitchen is in your face, for sure.”

I kept going because she didn’t say anything, and during this pandemic, the last thing you want to do is get into someone’s space when they don’t want you there. But I am also at an age that when I am out running I look for any excuse to stop and catch my breath, so that’s what I did at the corner after I was safely away from her.
 As I bent over panting, I noticed she looked at me, looked at the street signs, then looked at her phone, and back to me again. I sensed – again through the look in her eyes – that she was trying to decide whether to ask me for help, or possibly offer it. I tried to communicate with the look in my sweat-soaked eyes that I was a friendly, non-threatening, middle-aged man who was just trying not to have a heart attack at the top of a small hill.
 Just as I was about to ask her if she needed directions, she said, “Excuse me? Do you know where this address is?” and extended her phone.
 “Sure,” I said, not having seen the address yet. I grew up in Hermosa Beach. Of course I would know how to get her to where she needed to go.
 We kept our masks up and did the COVID two-step so that I could get as close as possible to safely read her outstretched phone. The text message she was showing me was in Spanish – which, embarrassingly enough for a man who is half Mexican in descent, I don’t know how to read – but I could discern the address, which she also told me verbally.
 I experienced that brain freeze that happens when you know a place so well that you don’t formally know the location of any specific address. I recognized the street name but had trouble with describing the best way to get there without using the landmarks of my personal memory.
 I could have said, “Ok, you know where that little house used to be where I helped my first girlfriend, the one I had in sixth grade, fold copies of _The Daily Breeze_ for her afternoon paper route? It’s condos now, but you take a right there, and then you go past that house where that kid lived who always wore those clunky black dress shoes to the Cub Scouts meeting and you take a left. I think the place you are looking for is right across from those apartments that had that raised brick patio in front of it, the one you definitely don’t want to try and ride your skateboard off of because it’s a lot higher than it looks.”

The absence of fans didn't stop Cincinnati Reds first baseman Joey Votto from receiving an ovation after hitting a homer to put his team ahead for good. All that applause Wednesday came from the Reds grounds crew. When they haven’t been keeping Great America Ball Park in tip-top shape, the groundskeepers have loudly cheered for the Reds from the stands. Teams throughout the major leagues have found different ways to maintain intensity without the benefit of fans in the ballpark. The Milwaukee Brewers have formed a makeshift band in the bullpen. Whenever Minnesota’s Sergio Romo leaves the bullpen to pitch, the other Twins relievers play maracas. But the most notable example arguably involves the Cincinnati grounds crew. Votto, who gave the crew noisemakers earlier this season, said the groundskeepers’ constant cheering even caused an opposing player to comment to him. “He said, ‘I hate that group,’\" Votto said. “And I thought, ‘That’s exactly what we want.’ That’s exactly what we want. We want the opposing team to hate, to be annoyed by them. I think they don’t care in the least. They’ve carried us at times, where we need energy, where we need, I don’t know, something different. They’ve made noise. They cheer. They talk mess. They’ve been fantastic all year.” Some of the Reds even made sure to meet the groundskeepers and thank them Wednesday after closing their home schedule with a 6-1 victory over the Brewers. “I can say having the grounds crew in our corner, I felt like was a distinct advantage for us because no other city had that,” Votto said. “No other city had a group that was willing to make noise, make musical noise, talk mess to the opposing first-base coach and players and support the team.” In fact, plenty of other...

Beto Da Silva llegó esta temporada a Alianza Lima, pero debido a constantes lesiones el futbolista solo ha jugado un partido con la camiseta blanquiazul, completando 90 minutos en la cancha, situación que ha incomodado a muchos hinchas blanquiazules. En las últimas horas, se difundieron documentos que indicaban que el futbolista percibía un sueldo de 15 mil dólares mensuales, agraviando la incomodidad de toda la hinchada. Sin embargo, el club de La Victoria se pronunció al respecto a través de un comunicado oficial. “El Club Alianza Lima rechaza categóricamente los actos de violación a la Ley de protección de datos personales y el derecho a la intimidad laboral que se vienen cometiendo en agravio de nuestra institución y de nuestros jugadores, al exponerse públicamente información inexacta sobre supuestos sueldos de algunos futbolistas del primer equipo”, inicia el documento. “Se trata de una publicación irresponsable y tendenciosa que dista de la realidad y que expone peligrosamente situaciones que obedecen al ámbito privado de profesionales que trabajan en la institución”, continuó. “Queremos dejar en claro que nuestra institución siempre ha cumplido las normas emitidas por la FIFA, por lo que los traspasos de jugadores se han celebrado directamente entre clubes, sin participación de ningún tercero en la contratación de futbolistas del club”, sigue. A nivel futbolístico, el cuadro que dirige Mario Salas no pasa por un buen momento. Desde que se reinició el fútbol, los blanquiazules no han logrado ni un solo triunfo en la cancha en la Liga 1 y tampoco en la Copa Libertadores, donde ocupan el último lugar del Grupo F, que comparten con Estudiantes de Mérida, Racing y Nacional de Uruguay.

There is a similar divergence between infection rates and hospitalizations in Germany and Austria. And in Britain, which reported 6,178 new coronavirus cases Wednesday — the highest figure since May 1 — just 134 patients were admitted to hospitals Monday, barely a tenth of those admitted in early May.
 Some experts argue that this shows the virus has lost potency since it first arrived in Europe, or that it is now infecting mostly younger people, who are less likely to experience severe symptoms. Others say it is a testament to social distancing, the widespread use of face masks, greater precautions for more vulnerable people and better medical treatment.
 “It’s not going to be like the first time when we needed to stop everything,” said Dr. Karol Sikora, an oncologist and professor of medicine at the University of Buckingham Medical School. “It’s going to be a slow burn.”
 He and 31 other doctors and scientists sent a letter to Johnson urging him to take a more targeted response to the spike in cases.
 Other experts, however, warn against being lulled into complacency. The gap between case numbers and hospital admissions, they say, is mainly a reflection of the fact that more people are being tested, and more quickly.
 “Deaths and hospitalizations are a lagging indicator,” said Devi Sridhar, director of the global health governance program at the University of Edinburgh. “There was no lag back in March because we only tested people who were already in the hospital. At a certain point, your ICUs are going to fill up.”
 The uncertainty about hospitalizations and deaths is another example of how mysterious the virus remains, even after 10 months of intense study. And that uncertainty complicates the task for political leaders who are balancing the need to protect their citizens with a desire avoid imposing more lockdowns.
 In France, where the government has adopted a philosophy of learning to live with the virus, President Emmanuel Macron has bucked pressure to impose new national restrictions and left it to cities to impose tighter curbs on public gatherings.
 “Many people told me, ‘Stop everything,’” he said Tuesday. “On the contrary, I believe that we must continue.”
 France currently has more than 5,700 people hospitalized with COVID-19. Roughly 900 of them are in intensive care. That is more than during the summer, when hospitalizations dropped to about 4,500 people, and it is raising concerns about strained hospital staff. But it is far less than during the peak last April, when more than 32,000 were hospitalized.

With an extra month to prepare for the season the Rice Lake football team looked to take advantage of the additional time as it tries to bounce back from a down year.
 Senior linebacker Scott Kinnick said while pushing the start date practices from early August to early September was disappointing, it also provided motivation to use that time effectively.
 “Going into it we knew that once it was going to get pushed back a lot of us had the mindset of we have to keep working, keep getting better,” Kinnick said, “because this gave us an extra month to get better. It kind of put a damper on everything getting it pushed back another month but it just made us focus on working together as a team — getting people to lift, get better and stronger as a team.”
 Rice Lake was 1-8 overall and 1-6 in the Big Rivers Conference to finish in seventh last season. Rice Lake returns 14 starters this year as it looks to make the most of a shortened schedule.
 Gone are second team all-conference linebacker Tyson Tomesh and defensive lineman Aiden Ferguson, along with departed starters Keith Blechinger, Bradley Hackel and Torien Hubbard.
 In practice leading up to its scrimmage last Friday, 15th-year head coach Dan Hill said the group has really grown together, something even more pivotal in an uncertain year.
 “Everybody talks about teamwork and the team and all that, but do you actually see it happening, where it’s growing,” he said, “and that’s what I like about these guys. It seems like each night we come out here they’re getting a better handle on what it means to be a great teammate. If that’s the only thing they got out of it, it would be a great lesson for them.”
 Rice Lake expects to have better depth in the back end of its defense this season. Senior Alex Belongia had 55 tackles and a team-high three interceptions last year. Also back are seniors Zack Fisher and Tristan Scheurer, while juniors Elliot Nolin and Teagan Scheurer will see more playing time.
 Kinnick will play a major part defensively at inside linebacker. The senior had 69 tackles a season ago, tops among returning players. Senior Andrew Farm and juniors Christian Lindow and Keagen Gunderson will provide depth.
 The Warriors lost their starting quarterback in Tomesh. Tristan Scheurer and junior Cole Fenske are poised to compete playing time as signal caller for the Warriors.
 Farm is back at fullback after the senior led the team with 463 yards rushing and three scores a season ago. Also in the backfield are senior fullback Fisher (58 carries for 225 yards), and senior halfbacks Jayden Perkins (24 attempts for 78 yards) and Hunter Heller (23 carries for 128 yards). Tristan Scheurer toted the rock 34 times for 248 yards last year.
 Belongia hauled in 22 passes for 301 yards and three touchdowns last year at receiver and should again be a top target when Rice Lake looks to pass.
 Along the line of scrimmage, Hill said 6-foot-1, 250 pound senior Andrew Hillyer has made a lot of progress, while sophomores Parker Owens (5-11, 195) and Nate Carroll (5-11, 203) made big strides in the offseason and will see the field a lot. Senior Colin Scheu (6-2, 185) returns as well as senior Kayden Warren. Warren (6-4, 225) made his commitment to walk-on to Division I FCS powerhouse North Dakota State last week and will be counted on for a big season.
 “He’s a 6-4 athletic lineman that can run, so they’re looking at being able to pack pounds on him,” Hill said of the Bison’s interest in Warren. “He’s a high motor, high aggression, athletic big kid.”
 Overall, Hill said, the lines won’t have quite the depth they were hoping as injuries have taken a toll. Fenske, though, said he likes what he has seen in practices as there has been solid development from younger players.
 “I would say we lost a lot of d-lineman last year, o-lineman, but from what I’ve seen lately the younger kids are stepping up and playing a big part in our offense and defense so far,” he said.
 Rice Lake opens the season Friday at New Richmond, a new member to the Big Rivers after state-wide realignment took effect this season. The Tigers are a growing program with a lot of good athletes, Hill said. New Richmond edged the Warriors 14-13 last season in what was a nonconference contest. New Richmond plays out of the shotgun and spreads out defenses with a mix of run-pass options.
 “It’s a challenge,” Hill said of defending New Richmond. “There are more teams doing it. It’s different than Menomonie, different than Chippewa. It’s a little bit unique. The run-pass RPO aspect of it causes you to think a little bit differently than we’ve done in the past.”
 Rice Lake will play each of the five active Big Rivers teams this year after Eau Claire North and Memorial, along with Superior, had their seasons pushed to an alternate spring schedule. The Warriors home opener is Oct. 3 against River Falls. Rice Lake also hosts Menomonie Oct. 23 and will have a nonconference home game versus Sparta on Oct. 30. Only parents will be allowed to attend games at Pug Lund Field this season though as the conference looks to limit spectators as a precaution.
 In a shortened season with uncertainty each week, the mindset of one game at a time is even more prevalent.
 “We focus on the week, we focus on what’s coming up next, because next week is not guaranteed,” Kinnick said. “Even if it was guaranteed like last year, you focus on what you need to do today to get ready for the game this week.”
 For the seniors throughout summer it was unknown what fall football would be like. That’s why for Farm it’s all about making the most of what’s given this season. When it became official there would be the opportunity, he knew he would need to do what it takes to make the year meaningful.
 “I would say no regrets,” Farm said of his goal this year, “leaving it all out on the field, so that I don’t come back when it’s all over, set and done, I said I gave it my best. I did everything I could.”
 There has been a positive feeling around the team in practices and the team’s scrimmage with Menomonie last week. It’s easy to get wrapped up in wins and losses, Hill said, but the focus should be on executing the team’s game plan. Football is about improvement and efficiency, he said, and this year more than ever the team is focused on controlling what it can control.
 “We’re just focused on us getting better every day. There’s a lot of stuff that happens, just like this pandemic, it’s out of our control,” he said. “The kids are doing a great job of that. They’re not looking far beyond. It’s like here we are today, let’s go.”

The poll partly coincided with Trump’s announcement that he would make a new Supreme Court nomination to fill the vacancy created by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, but it was not clear from the survey whether voters had a particularly strong reaction to that possibility.
 Mary McKinney, 48, of St. Charles, Iowa, said she supported Trump because of his plain-spoken manner but felt the Supreme Court process was moving “a little fast,” adding that she would not support efforts to outlaw abortion.
 “I don’t like abortion, but I don’t like a woman being forced to carry a baby due to a traumatic incident, so I guess I’m kind of neutral on that,” said McKinney, who works at home as a foster parent.
 Reflecting the conservative tilt of the states polled, Trump and his party are in better shape than in most of the others recently polled by The Times, and he may ultimately carry all of them. The president’s approval rating is in positive territory in Texas, and voters are almost evenly split in Iowa and Georgia. That is markedly stronger than Trump’s standing in core swing states like Wisconsin and Arizona.
