Reynold said the 77 counties that are being reopened “have stabilized and demonstrated a downward trend for 14 days.”
 There are no restrictions to prevent Iowans living in so-called “hot spots” where COVID-19 is prevalent from traveling to the newly reopened areas of the state to dine out or go shopping. “People have to be responsible,” Reynolds said. “You have to practice personal responsibility … People still have to do their part. If you’re sick, you need to stay home. If you’re a vulnerable Iowan with underlying conditions, you need to, you know, continue to keep that in mind and stay home and not go into areas where you could be exposed to the virus.”
 Asked whether the state is recommending that Iowans living in hot spots refrain from traveling to the newly reopened areas of the state, Dr. Caitlin Pedati, the state medical director, said the agency “will be providing additional guidance that will help people understand, you know, how to approach this.”
 Reynolds said there are 15 counties where there has been no virus activity at all. “And so they are at a place where we can start to — in a very safe and responsible manner — open up the counties and start to open up the state,” she said. “And I have confidence in Iowans that they are going to continue to be a part of this solution, and that they’re going to continue to do the right thing.”
 Reynolds said the reopening of the 77 counties represents an evolution in her strategy for fighting the pandemic in Iowa.
 “As governor, I had the responsibility to implement significant mitigation measures to protect Iowans during an unprecedented time, which included closing some businesses, suspending elective (medical) procedures, as well as many other things, all in an effort to slow the spread of the virus, preserve critical health care resources and prevent overwhelming our hospital systems. However, this level of mitigation is not sustainable for the long term and it has unintended consequences for Iowa families. So, we must gradually shift from an aggressive mitigation strategy to focus on containing and managing virus activity for the long term.”
 Reynolds noted that there are “specific locations” in Iowa where the virus is widespread, areas where its presence is sporadic and areas where it’s believed to be nonexistent. “Knowing this, we can take a targeted approach to loosening restrictions on businesses and counties where there is no virus activity or where virus activity has been consistently low and shown a downward trend,” she said.
 The Iowa Legislature announced Monday that it would not return to session before May 15.
 Reynolds also reported on Monday 349 newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Iowa, bringing the statewide total to 5,868 cases. She also reported nine additional deaths, bringing that total to 127 people. All of the nine were older adults.

Geneva [Switzerland], April 28 (ANI): The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has urged Bangladesh to "immediately allow" two boats with 500 Rohingya refugees onboard "to come ashore and receive necessary food, water and health care."   The human rights group said in a statement on Saturday the boats have been trying to reach the shores of Bangladesh from the international waters since early last week. But the Bangladesh Navy and Bangladesh Coast Guard are not allowing them into the country, Dhaka Tribune reported.   "I am writing to request your urgent assistance to ensure a safe haven is found in a timely manner for hundreds of refugees and migrants currently stranded at sea," High Commissioner Michelle Bachelet said in a letter to Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen.   "This is a human tragedy of terrible proportions. In a spirit of solidarity and at the beginning of the Holy Month of Ramadan, I appeal to you in the strongest terms to open your ports and allow the boats to land," read the April 24 letter, a copy of which was obtained by Dhaka Tribune.   The appeal was made after Momen said last Thursday that he would not allow any more Rohingyas into the country because "Bangladesh is always asked to take care of the responsibility of other countries."   He added that many Bangladeshis are returning home amid the COVID-19 pandemic, so "we have no room to shelter any foreign people or refugees."   His declaration last week raised alarm as it came only days after dozens of Rohingya died on a boat that waited at sea for two months before it could land.   The two new boats are believed to be in international waters hoping to get an opportunity to reach Malaysia.   The Malaysian navy turned back one boat last week and has increased patrols as it expects increased attempts to smuggle people into the country.   Nearly one million Rohingya, who fled atrocities in their native Myanmar in 2018, are living in refugee camps in Bangladesh.   In her letter, Bachelet further asked to ensure proper responses to refugees and migrants in distress at sea and avoid "dangerous interception practices and collective expulsions, including pushing back boats."

Oreck describes the EP as a “challenging but hopeful” commentary on the way that we are connected “all over this shrinking world” as the driving track “No Place to Run” puts it. “A Simple Song,” is a sweet folk ballad about the power of songs to connect us, harkening back to a time in the 60s and 70s when music mobilized and electrified a generation. “A 60s Hippie’s Psychedelic Nightmare” challenges Oreck’s generation to re-commit to change and hope. On a personal note, “Geezer in the Weeds _”_ tells the story of a man fitting into nature and finding real peace. The title tune “We Fit Together _,”_ co-written with Larry Stallman, looks at how we all fit – with a partner, lover, friend, and in the world.

Given all the public-private partnerships responding to the need for timely COVID-19 therapies, diagnostics and vaccines, the demands to forgo patents for coronavirus products and to prevent industry from "profiting" from taxpayer- supported research are growing louder in the U.S. The trouble is the U.S. has already been there, done that - and it doesn't work, according to experts speaking last week at an Information Technology & Innovation Foundation webinar on Bayh-Dole during the COVID-19 pandemic. Contrary to a lot of public opinion, industry is not getting a free ride under the 40-year-old law. "The financial sting is very real," said Wendy Commins Holman, CEO and founder of Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP. Her company has put everything else on hold to focus 24-7 on developing an antiviral targeting SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for the pandemic. If the compound fails, "nobody's going to make those losses good," she said.

The Turkish government passed a bill last week to release some 90,000 inmates, including mob bosses, racketeers, and looters, to reduce the risk of a COVID-19 outbreak in its crowded prisons. Yet President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will be keeping political prisoners behind bars, including former presidential candidate Selahattin Demirtas of the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP), and scores of other HDP lawmakers, mayors, and party officials.
 Erdogan has a track record of exploiting crises to expand his power, and is refusing to let the pandemic disrupt his campaign to deprive Turkey’s 15 million Kurds of their constitutional rights.
 Erdogan’s assault on Kurdish rights continues even as Turkey has overtaken China, reporting more than 110,000 cases as of April 27, the seventh highest number of infections in the world. So far, Erdogan seems more concerned about protecting his political interests than containing the pandemic. Following suit with his fellow authoritarians, Erdogan has kept a tight lid on coronavirus news, arresting over 400 individuals for their social media posts for “attempting to stir unrest,” interrogating reporters for “inciting the public to panic,” and even filing a criminal complaint against the anchor of Fox TV’s Turkish subsidiary for “spreading lies and manipulating the public on social media.”

WESTCHESTER COUNTY, New York (WPIX/CNN) - A New York woman born during the Spanish flu pandemic has the distinction of surviving a second pandemic, more than 100 years after she survived the first one.Angelina Friedman, née Sciales, came into the world in 1918 on a passenger ship bringing immigrants from Italy to New York City. It was during the second wave of the Spanish flu pandemic, which is sometimes compared to the COVID-19 pandemic.Angelina Friedman, 101, was diagnosed with COVID-19 at a New York hospital March 21, where she spent a week before returning to isolation in her nursing home. She finally tested negative for the virus April 20.“Her mother died giving birth on the ship, and she was taken care of by her two sisters, who were also on board,” said Joanne Merola, Friedman’s daughter.According to the World Health Organization, the Spanish flu infected about a third of the world’s population. Roughly 50 million people died from it.Throughout her nearly 102 years of life, Friedman survived not only Spanish flu but also miscarriages, cancer, sepsis and now, a second pandemic, this time COVID-19. She has outlived her husband and 10 siblings."Everybody in the family lived until at least 95, except one uncle," Merola said. "My mother is a survivor. She is not human. She has superhuman DNA."Friedman, a resident of the North Westchester Restorative Therapy and Nursing Center in Lake Mohegan, New York, was taken to the hospital March 21 for a minor medical procedure but received a COVID-19 diagnosis. She spent a week in the hospital then returned to the nursing home, where she was isolated in her room.After running a fever on and off for several weeks, Friedman finally tested negative for coronavirus April 20. Merola hasn’t been able to visit her mother since February, due to back trouble, and because Friedman is nearly deaf, they can’t speak on the phone. But the nurses have kept Merola updated with her mother’s progress.“They tell me she’s doing great. She’s up and about as much as possible. She’s looking for wool to crochet with,” Merola said. "If my mother could see this, I’d tell her, ‘You keep going, Ma. You’re gonna outlive us all.’”Copyright 2020 WPIX, Friedman Family, Smith Family, NYC Health and Hospitals via CNN.

Autopsy results are now being released and it's being found that people were dying of coronavirus in the United States before the first official death.The first COVID-19 related death was recorded down to be on February 29th, but now reports are showing that people were dying weeks before that date, suggesting that the virus was already spreading in the US in late January. According to a new report by The Chronicle, people were dying of COVID-19 on February 6th-17th, and one of those people were Patricia Dowd. The autopsy report showed that the virus had made its way into her lungs, trachea, intestines and heart.It was discovered that the damage the virus did to her heart was what caused Dowd to die, and according to Bay Area forensic pathologist Dr. Judy Melinek who examined the autopsy report, 'There's something abnormal about the fact that a perfectly normal heart has burst open. Normal hearts don't rupture. This heart ruptured or tore open because of an infection of the heart muscle caused by the coronavirus.'The next question that was asked was if Dowd was a 'healthy' person. Dr. Susan Parson who was the one who performed the autopsy on Dowd said that Dowd was 'mildy obese', but overall was healthy and didn't seem to have any other previous health complications. UCSF pathologist Dr. Andrew Connolly also reviewed the report and said that the patient developed some mild case of pneumonia and related the bursting of her heart to be caused by an autoimmune response.If you are interested in reading more on this subject, check out this link here.
