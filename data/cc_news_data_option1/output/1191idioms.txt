"We have a culture here in Germany that is actually _not_ supporting a centralized diagnostic system," said Drosten, "so Germany does not have a public health laboratory that would restrict other labs from doing the tests. So we had an open market from the beginning."
 In other words, Germany's equivalent to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — the Robert Koch Institute — makes recommendations but does not call the shots on testing for the entire country. Germany's 16 federal states make their own decisions on coronavirus testing because each of them is responsible for their own health care systems.
 When Drosten's university medical center developed what became the test recommended by the World Health Organization, they rolled these tests out to their colleagues throughout Germany in January.
 "And they of course rolled this out to labs they know in the periphery and to hospital labs in the area where they are situated," Drosten said. "This created a situation where, let's say, by the beginning or middle of February, testing was already in place, broadly."
 Drosten said that has meant quicker, earlier and more widespread testing for COVID-19 in Germany than in other countries.
 Lothar Wieler, head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's federal agency responsible for disease control and prevention, said at a news conference last week that Germany's testing infrastructure means authorities have a more accurate read of confirmed cases of the virus.
 "We don't know exactly how many unknown cases there are, but we estimate that this unknown number is not very high," Wieler said. "The reason is simple. We issued recommendations in mid-January about who should be tested and who shouldn't be tested."
 But some Berlin residents aren't as confident as Wieler. Nizana Nizzi Brautmann said she was worried when a teacher at her son's school tested positive for COVID-19 and a day later she and her son woke up with fevers and persistent coughing. She said she couldn't get through to Berlin's coronavirus hotline, which was continuously busy.
 She finally got through to the city's emergency medical service number, "and I told her I think we need to be checked because we have some symptoms," Brautmann recalled. "The lady was just saying, 'We make no tests here. I can't help you. I would advise you to stay home and drink tea.' "
 When she finally was able to speak to a doctor on the phone, the doctor told her to wait in line outside a local hospital to get tested, but she didn't have a mask for her or her son, and she didn't want to infect others in line, so she stayed home. She and her son are now in good health, but she said the episode left her wondering how prepared German society is for this pandemic.
 Drosten said such experiences are probably an exception, not the rule.
 "I know the diagnostics community in Germany a bit," Drosten said. "My feeling is that actually the supply of tests is still good. And of course, our epidemic is now also very much up-ramping and we will lose track here, too."
 Drosten said the growing number of cases in Germany will soon exceed testing capacities. But for the time being, he thinks the country has had a robust response to the coronavirus pandemic. He's most worried about countries in Africa that aren't well set up for this — countries that, once the crisis comes to them, will find it more difficult to flatten the curve.

"This is going to trigger a once-in-a-hundred-year event that has the perfect storm of conditions for cratering a huge portion of the American small- business community," John Lettieri, the president and CEO of the Economic Innovation Group, told Reuter.
 And Lettieri noted that new businesses -- those that scale and grow -- are often the largest job creators, meaning that there may be a double whammy of startups going under and the economy losing the new roles they would have created.
 For the two million workers forecasted to lose their jobs due to a recession brought on by the pandemic, that lack of new roles will likely be felt deeply. If Palihapitiya's prediction holds true, to weather the storm and continue hiring businesses will need to find significant cash reserves -- from somewhere.

Now that spring has arrived, delightful thoughts come to mind as I think of the magnificent plants that illuminate the garden. I love large shrubs that take center stage but I also adore those early perennials and minor bulbs that brighten smaller spaces. These are ones that are not grown as often, those rarer jewels that need to be lauded. I do not have as many as I would like but some of those that I do grow, I want to sing their praises.      One of the first to break the ground is Ranunculus ficaria "Brazen Hussy," a plant I first saw when visiting a garden in eastern Virginia. This deer- resistant spring perennial emerges with glossy dark burgundy foliage that contrasts well with the cheerful daffodil-yellow flowers. The stark contrast between the foliage and the flowers sets this plant apart and makes it stand out from a distance. I have had it for about 10 years and it comes back each February like clockwork and then it disappears, as the temperatures get warmer. I have read it is invasive but I still have the two plants that I purchased from Plants Delights and it is not invasive where I have them growing.      Bloodroot, (Sanguinaria) is a charming woodland plant that emerges and quickly shows off white flowers that stand out against the brown leaf litter. I also am attracted to the shape of the leaves and find them to be quite attractive and interesting. The leaves grow larger as the summer progresses, sporting deeply cut lobes that are quite eye-catching. This is a North American woodland perennial that is called bloodroot because it has a red sap that oozes from the roots when cut. Native American basket makers used the sap as a source of red dye. However, they did not use it as face paint because it is toxic if rubbed onto the skin.      Many of my gardening friends grow Virginia Bluebells, (Mertensia virginica), a cherished native that delights us in spring with nodding clusters of pink buds that open to sky blue flowers. These charming bell-shaped flowers have cool, soft green foliage making a beautiful display in a shaded area of the garden. You need to enjoy them quickly because as the flowers fade, so does the foliage and, before you know it, they disappear and go dormant until the following spring.      Brunnera has also become a favorite of mine for the shade garden. This trouble-free plant has dainty blue flowers that resemble forget-me-nots. The flowers stand high above the foliage on thin stems that sway in a gentle breeze. The one I grow is called Brunnera "Jack Frost" and was chosen the perennial of the year in 2012 by the Perennial Plant Association. This hardy plant is grown not only for the flowers but also for the veined heart-shaped leaves that are green and white and, if it does not get too hot and dry, they look pretty all summer long. My husband thinks these leaves are caladiums leaves in the summer, a plant he wants me to grow. I do not tell him that those variegated showy leaves are not what he thinks. What he does not know will not hurt him.      Phlox divaricata, a perennial with delightful blue or white flowers, is another woodland native which forms mats of foliage with stems that typically reach 12 inches tall. My friend Pat Burton introduced me to this plant and told me to be sure and purchase the variety called "Blue Moon." It is a lovely native phlox groundcover featuring clouds of rich violet-blue blooms that float above green foliage. It has a slight fragrance to wake up one's senses, and it flowers in March and April where I live. It is a perfect addition to a rock garden or any shady spot where it can slowly naturalize. I have it by a stream and I am hoping that one day, the mats will become large enough that they drape over the rocks lining the stream.      If you like to plant bulbs or corms, you should try planting Erythronium, which is also called Trout Lilies or Dogtooth Violet. I grow one called "Pagoda" which bears graceful sulfur yellow flowers with a reddish-brown ring at the center. The flower is shaped like a tiny lily and the leaves are a beautiful bright green. I grow mine in part shade with rich woodsy soil. These deer and rodent resistant plants only last for a short time because, by late May, the Dogtooth Lilies have gone dormant for the summer.   Think about planting some to brighten up a small space where you want a little something extra. Many of them are called spring ephemerals because the plants last only a brief time. They bloom and die back and go dormant and disappear from view shortly after they stop flowering. I enjoy them and I hope I always have a place for a few in the garden. These early charmers are a joy to grow.      Betty Montgomery is a master gardener and author of "Hydrangeas: How To Grow, Cultivate & Enjoy," and "A Four-Season Southern Garden."

The official attendance for the Feb. 19 game was 45,792 — a "home" record for Atalanta, a small club making its debut in Europe's top club competition.
 Atalanta captain Alejandro "Papu" Gómez told Argentine daily Olé it was "terrible" to have played that game.
 "It's a city of 120,000 people and that day (40,000) went to the San Siro," the Argentine said. "It was a historic match for Atalanta, something unique. To give you an idea, my wife took three hours to get to Milan, when that trip normally takes 40 minutes."
 The game was played in Milan because Atalanta's stadium in Bergamo didn't meet the requirements set by European soccer governing body UEFA.
 Before the match, Valencia fans freely roamed around Milan and gathered at some of the city's plazas, including the Piazza del Duomo, drinking and chanting team songs.
 Looking back, the conditions for virus contagion were high, with thousands of people gathering without much concern — at a time when the outbreak in Europe wasn't yet known — and then traveling back home. Nearly 30 busloads of fans made the 60-kilometer (37-mile) trip from Bergamo to Milan.
 The evening before the match, there was no social distancing as officials from both clubs mingled and exchanged gifts and handshakes at a gala dinner offered by Atalanta.
 "I have heard a lot (of theories), I'll say mine: Feb. 19, 40,000 Bergamaschi went to San Siro for Atalanta-Valencia," Fabiano di Marco, the chief pneumologist at the hospital in Bergamo, told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. "In buses, cars, trains. A biological bomb, unfortunately."
 Valencia defender Ezequiel Garay was the first Spanish league player to test positive for COVID-19. The team played a Spanish league game against Alavés about two weeks after the game in Milan, and later Alavés reported that 15 people in the club were infected, though it did not say the cases were directly related to the match against Valencia.
 Italian soccer players' association president Damiano Tommasi believes sports authorities should look long and hard at the Atalanta match before restarting leagues.

As confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Germany soared past 10,000 last week, hundreds of Berliners crowded Volkspark am Friedrichshain to play soccer and basketball, and to let their kids loose on the park's many jungle gyms.
 The conditions seemed ideal for the spread of a virus that has killed thousands. Yet Germany's fatality rate so far — just 0.5% — is the world's lowest, by a long shot.
 "I believe that we are just testing much more than in other countries, and we are detecting our outbreak early," said Christian Drosten, director of the institute of virology at Berlin's Charité hospital.
 As Europe has become the epicenter of the global coronavirus pandemic, Italy's fatality rate hovers around 10%. France's is around 5%. Yet Germany's fatality rate from COVID-19 has remained remarkably low since cases started showing up there more than a month ago. As of March 25, there were 175 deaths and 34,055 cases.
 Drosten, whose team of researchers developed the first COVID-19 test used in the public domain, said Germany's low fatality rate is because of his country's ability to test early and often. He estimates Germany has been testing around 120,000 people a week for COVID-19 during the monthlong period from late February to now, when it's reached epidemic proportions in the country, the most extensive testing regimen in the world.

“What that indicates is preparation,” he said. “Essentially, what we’re doing now is to ensure to the maximum extent possible that we’re not caught short.”
 The high number of available beds in B.C. hospitals is “unprecedented,” Dix said. “We have to be prepared for the possible influx of patients.”
 The cancellation of elective surgeries has freed up many of the beds that otherwise would have been occupied, Dix said.
 Hospital discharges, Henry said, are based on a case-by-case basis and involve decisions based on such things as what the patient was being treated for and what kind of home support is available to them.
 “This is being done on an individual basis across the system,” she said.
 Asked if it was inevitable that B.C. would follow countries like Italy, which have experienced much higher rates of coronavirus infection and higher death rates due to the disease, Henry said she didn’t think so.
 “I do not believe we are on the same trajectory as Italy,” she said.
 Reasons for that belief, she said, included swifter action to limit social gatherings once the virus had become established, as well as different testing strategy aimed at identifying people considered to be most at risk from the coronavirus.
 Later this week, Henry said she would be releasing information about the curve of coronavirus infections in B.C. with the modelling intended to project the disease’s progression among British Columbians.
 Two more long-term care facilities, neither of which is in Interior Health, have reported cases of coronavirus among residents or staff. There was one case at each facility, Henry said.
 About 3,500 coronavirus tests are being done daily in B.C., said Dix, who praised what he said was the “courageous and heroic” work done by employees of the B.C. Centre for Disease Control and its partners.

The Haviland Care Center, a Mission Health Community located in Haviland, has taken up protocols and precautions to protect their patients, residents and staff from the threat of COVID-19. A strict no visitation policy went into effect on March 9. Communal dining and all group activities have been suspended, frequent reminders are given to practice hand hygiene and social distancing. All patients, staff and residents are regularly screened for signs of fever and respiratory symptoms, according to a press release from Mission Health.
   
 "The protection of our residents from infectious disease is our utmost concern to us all," said Karel Page, Haviland Care Center Administrator. "In light of the gravity of current circumstances, we have taken the serious step, in accordance with guidelines from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to close our Community to visitors until further notice. This includes all outside visitors and non-essential health care personnel."
   
 Exceptions to this rule may include end-of-life situations and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Hospice workers, EMS personnel, dialysis technicians and others will be allowed to enter with frequent health screenings and personal protective equipment.
   
 "This is not easy for us," Page said. "We know how important personal connection is for residents and their family members. But the threat of COVID-19 is so great for older people and those with underlying health conditions, that we must do everything possible to protect the entire Community."
   
 The Haviland Care Center is happy to help coordinate family members connection with their loved ones via telephone, text, video chat, email or social media.
   
 "Even as we need to practice being physically apart for now, we are committed to finding ways for people to be together," Page said. "Because that's how we'll all get through this together."

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday that he's also considering hotels and dormitories for treatment sites as work continues to turn the city's Jacob K. Javits Convention Center into a temporary field hospital. In Michigan, a suburban Detroit university offered up its basketball gym for a makeshift hospital and parking lots for drive-thru testing sites.

“When people write about cults, usually they write about them after the fact,” Weiss explains. “And the thing here is, this church-slash-cult is still in business and it's thriving and it seems like they're impenetrable. No matter what we write or anybody writes or says, they have some kind of protection, because they're thriving.”

The pandemic has forced some writers and editors to move mountains — or in this case, planets — to have future horoscopes reflect the changing times.
 A long-running feature in newspapers and websites, horoscopes can provide a chuckle, some pause for thought, or even eye-rolling among those who don't believe in forecasts of the future.
 Many astrologers clearly didn't see the pandemic coming, judging by some of the recent suggestions in Canadian online horoscopes.
 Hopefully Capricorns didn't follow advice last Sunday to "get together with people you share history with" or "attend a reunion."
 Scorpios had a challenge on their hands that day — "Go to a yoga class" seems ambitious given that studios are closed.
 And a recommendation for Geminis last weekend? "Network and gather friends together, making helpful introductions" during the day and "host a gathering" at night.

 What we are watching in the U.S. ...
 Governors across the nation rejected President Donald Trump's new accelerated timeline for reopening the U.S. economy, as they continued to impose more restrictions on travel and public life in an attempt to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
 The dismissal of Trump's mid-April timeframe for a national reopening came from Republicans and Democrats, from leaders struggling to manage hot spots of the outbreak and those still bracing for the worst. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, the head of the National Governors Association and a Republican, called the messaging confusing since most leaders are still focused on enforcing the restrictions, not easing them. He accused the White House of running on a schedule made of some “imaginary clock.”
 The pushback suggests Trump's talk of an early reboot is unlikely to gain traction. In most cases, it's state leaders — not the federal government — who are responsible for both imposing and lifting the stay-at-home orders and other restrictions intended to stop the contagion.
 But the governors' reaction also revealed the striking disconnect and growing tensions between Trump and the state leaders closer to the front lines of a crisis that threatens to overwhelm U.S. hospitals and claim thousands of lives.
 The president is eager to get the U.S. back to work as the crisis takes a political toll and the economy, which had been the cornerstone of his re- election bid, begins to wobble. The economic damage could be worse than the death toll from the virus, he has said. As soon as next week, Trump wants to take another look at recommendations about business closures and self- isolation, and said Tuesday the country could reopen by Easter Sunday — less than a month away. “Our people want to return to work," he said.

 Spanish army troops disinfecting nursing homes have found, to their horror, some residents living in squalor among the infectious bodies of people suspected of dying from the new coronavirus, authorities said.
 Defence Minister Margarita Robles said the elderly residents were “completely left to fend for themselves, or even dead, in their beds.” She said the discovery over the weekend included several nursing homes but did not name them or say how many bodies were found.
 A judicial probe into the horrific discovery was opened Tuesday as Spain announced a record one-day jump of nearly 6,600 new coronavirus infections, bringing the overall total to more than 39,600. The number of deaths also leaped by a record 514 to almost 2,700, second only to Italy and China.
 As bodies piled up, Madrid took over a public skating rink as a makeshift morgue after the city facility overflowed. To date, 1,535 people have died in the hard-hit Spanish capital, more than half of the national total. The capital region has over 12,350 infections.
 “This is a tough week,” Dr. Fernando Simón, head of Spain's health emergency centre, told a daily news briefing.
