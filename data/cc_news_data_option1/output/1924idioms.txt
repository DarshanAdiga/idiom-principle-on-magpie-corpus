Something that PC gamers repudiate is that developers use the Denuvo protection system in the titles for this platform. Unfortunately, sometimes it is the only alternative available to ensure the protection of the game on PC. One of the most recent titles that adopted it is DOOM Eternal and, as you can imagine, users have not taken it positively, and this can be seen with the number of negative reviews it is receiving after the Denuvo activation.

A half-hour drive from his home is Sonapur, the ‘city of gold’ that best sums up the Dubai mirage. Once a “Dharavi-like slum” in the badlands housing labourers from across the world, and mostly Malayalis among them, it has had both a literal and figurative facelift. Now these gilded dorms also room migrants from elsewhere in India. The impetus for this renovation came in 2013 after Dubai was awarded the 2020 World Expo. That “hot air balloon” was almost meant to burst, and the “Men behind the curtain” issued an edict to the workers that essentially said, “Click your heels together three times and go home”, says Nida*, a migration watcher based out of Abu Dhabi. In this land of Oz, workers make convenient straw men when things don’t go to plan.

There is, of course, a note of weirdness in the basic idea of football as our first shared step to normality. There’s a famous Dave Chapelle joke about MTV broadcasting the views of the rapper Ja Rule shortly after the Word Trade Centre was taken down. As Chapelle points out: “I want some answers that Ja Rule might not have right now.” Perhaps there are those among us who felt all along that one day Steve McManaman would be the voice to guide our first tentative steps out of a global pandemic. But then football was always likely to jostle its way to the front of this queue, to plonk its tankard down on the bar for first helpings.

 Three people were reported in the water just after 1:30 p.m., said Petty Officer Joshua Gonzalez of the U.S. Coast Guard station at Presque Isle.
   
 One person had been picked up by a Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission vessel when a Coast Guard crew arrived at the scene, Gonzalez said. Two people were on top of the capsized vessel.
   
 A second person was taken on board the Fish and Boat Commission vessel. The Coast Guard rescued the third person, who may have suffered a minor case of hypothermia, Gonzalez said.

La crisis ocasionada por el nuevo coronavirus en el Perú no solo es económica y sanitaria. La pandemia y los gestos han desencadenado en decisiones que afectan en la consecución del objetivo en “esta guerra”, tal como catalogó a este panorama el presidente Martín Vizcarra hace algunas semanas. Según El Comercio, seis de los primeros médicos convocados al Comité de Expertos que asesora al Gobierno en la toma de decisiones frente al COVID-19 ha renunciado a dicho grupo de trabajo. Inicialmente, el Comité de Expertos estaba conformado por 14 médicos. Esto significa que casi el 50% de ellos ha renunciado en los últimos días a continuar asesorando al Poder Ejecutivo. Este grupo especializado de trabajo recomienda medidas y es consultado por el presidente Vizcarra y sus ministros en esta coyuntura de crisis a nivel sanitario en todo el país. Rosa López Martinez, coordinadora de la Unidad de Cuidados Intensivos de Transplantes en el hospital Guillermo Almenara, ha sido la última en renunciar hasta este domingo. “Ves decisiones que no se dan. Se produce la catástrofe, pides que se haga más, ves si en tu hospital hay espacio para recibir a tus colegas y encuentras una expresión de desprecio. El Gobierno dice cifras que no son ciertas y se ampara en expertos“, señaló minutos después de haber presentado su renuncia a través del Whastapp. A su vez, los profesionales de la salud Ciro Maguiña, Felix Llanos, Ricardo Sánchez, Jesús Valverde y Eduardo Ticona adoptaron previamente la decisión de su colega López Martinez. Ellos son el vicedecano del Colegio Médico del Perú, neumólogos de la Sociedad Peruana de Neumología, presidente de la Sociedad Peruana de Medicina Intensivista e intensivista, respectivamente. El infectólogo Ciro Maguiña declaró esta semana luego de convertirse en la primera autoridad sanitaria en renunciar al Comité de Expertos. Según Maguiña, su salida se producía debido a las declaraciones del ministro de Salud Víctor Zamora sobre los médicos en estado de gravedad a causa de contraer el COVID-19 en ejercicio de sus funciones. “He renunciado al Comité de Expertos. No puedo avalar al ministro Zamora, nos ha dañado mucho con sus palabras”, adujo Maguiña tras su dimisión. Asimismo, las decisiones del Gobierno en los últimos días han derivado en las constantes renuncias a este grupo de trabajo, importante en la lucha contra la pandemia. Es el caso del intensivista Eduardo Ticona, quien indicó que más allá de las declaraciones del ministro Zamora, lo que terminó ocasionando su indignación y renuncia fue el traslado de ventiladores mecánicos del hospital Dos de Mayo. “Más me ha indignado a mí lo ocurrido con los ventiladores en el hospital Dos de Mayo. Es comprensible que puedan salir a otros lugares, pero llevarlos sin previo aviso desconcierta”, sostuvo.

NEWPORT, R.I.-- Rachel Griffith celebrated Mother's Day in Rhode Island this year, but will be somewhere else in 2021. Her husband is Aaron Griffith, a major in the Army, and the couple has moved five times since getting married.
   
 He's studying at the Naval War College until June, when yet another move is scheduled.
   
 Their time in the Ocean State certainly will be memorable as the coronavirus pandemic forced day-to-day life to change in a seismic fashion. That meant more time at home with 4-year-old son Gavin, a student at Portsmouth Nursery School, as well as caring for Owen, who was just 9 weeks old when the pandemic hit.
   
 "We've been in isolation for almost two months now, and my mindset is completely different now than it was when this all started -- in a good way," Rachel wrote to The Daily News in an email. "Initially, probably like most people, I was a stressed-out wreck. I wasn't able to sleep at night because I was so worried about one or all of us getting sick. I eventually stopped following the news because every headline made me worry more, and I didn't want Gavin to pick up on how I was feeling.
   
 "Once we got over that hump and I was confident that all of us were healthy, things started to change."
   
 As the anxiety settled, so too did the stress that comes with caring for two young children. Gavin does daily activities on the computer set up by his teacher at Portsmouth Nursery School and Owen, now 16 weeks, has grown into more of a routine.
   
 "I can plan the day better and know when I can dedicate time to Gavin and do something fun with him," Rachel wrote.
   
 Knowing visitors are few and far between, things don't have to be "spic and span." So she's more willing to bring out the craft box and make a mess.
   
 "We have so much fun together!" she wrote. "So if there's a positive that comes out of this situation, it's that it has allowed me [to] legitimately play with my kids and not worry about anything else."
   
 Most mothers are thinking about things like grocery shopping, laundry and putting themselves together. During the coronavirus pandemic, those things can wait, Rachel said. Her husband's classes at the war college are online, so he's around more than he was before the coronavirus made its way to Rhode Island.
   
 "Spending this much family time together is unheard of as a military family," she said. "My heart bursts when I see my husband snuggling on the couch with our two boys. He was deployed and in a very demanding job for the first 18 months of Gavin's life, so this family time is something I won't take for granted."
   
 The family will move to Fort Hood, Texas, in June, but they'll always remember the year they spent so much time together in Rhode Island.
   
 "We're really sad to leave this area," Rachael said. "It's gorgeous and the locals are so kind."

New Delhi [India], May 17 (ANI): The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Sunday, while issuing guidelines for Lockdown 4.0, met the demand of almost all States, allowing them to decide Red, Green and Orange zones on their own but as per the parameter of Union Health and Family Welfare Ministry.   "The delineation of Red, Green and Orange zones will be decided by respective States and Union Territory governments after taking into consideration the parameter shared by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare," said the Home Ministry.   According to the MHA, within the Red and Orange zones, containment zones and buffer zones will be demarcated by the district authorities after taking into consideration the guidelines of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.   In the containment zone, only essential activities shall be allowed. There shall be restricted perimeter control to ensure that there is no movement of people in and out of these zones except for medical emergency and for maintaining the supply of essential goods and services, added the MHA.   As per the new guidelines, in the containment zone, there shall be intensive contact tracing, house to house surveillance and other clinical interventions as required.   The night curfew movement of individuals shall remain strictly prohibited between 7 pm and 7 am except for essential services.

NEW ORLEANS - New Orleans fashion designer Ellen Macomber has begun producing coronavirus-era masks perforated with small lip-level holes. Her new creation is meant to answer the crucial question: How are you supposed to sip a cocktail while wearing a mask?
   
 Behind the hole, Macomber points out, there's a little flap of fabric that closes like a trap door when you're not sipping.
   
 "You can use them to social-distance and drink," she said, "instead of taking your mask on and off and touching your face and all that. And if you're talking, you're not going to be spitting all over the place."
   
 Macomber said the first batch of beverage-accessible masks sold like hot cakes. The concept, she said, was suggested by a friend. Of course, the punctured masks are a touch tongue-in-cheek, meant to blend protection with a little Crescent City self-satire.
   
 Homemade masks don't provide the level of protection that hospital-grade masks do, but they are recommended because they reduce the odds that an infected person will spread the virus and because they don't use up supplies needed by doctors and nurses.
   
 Macomber is quick to point out that it's still up to the user to practice proper social-distancing protocols, and she has a line of conventional unperforated masks as well.
   
 The coronavirus has been tough on Macomber's regular business. She usually sells her arty, one-of-a-kind caftans, capes and headdresses at Jazz Fest. But that was canceled this year, as were the other pop-up sales opportunities in Aspen and Los Angeles that she'd counted on to help make ends meet.
   
 Macomber also decided to close her Magazine Street shop instead of paying rent for a space that, under the stay-at-home order, isn't generating any revenue.
   
 "I've lost most of my income," she said.
   
 On the bright side, clothing commissions have stayed steady, she said, and the mask-making operation has allowed her to keep her assistant employed. Macomber, 43, said she's confident that, one way or another, she's going to be OK. After all, her career as an artist survived Hurricane Katrina.
   
 "I'm adaptable," she said.

Pan the camera to Malappuram, the district that finds itself frequently picked on for being Muslim-majority. One in three households here is an NRK household.

On Monday, close-contact businesses and recreation facilities can begin reopening in South Carolina after they were ordered to close in April due to concerns over the coronavirus.
   
 These businesses - such as salons, barbershops, gyms and public swimming pools - have been given industry-specific safety guidelines intended to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
   
 The safety guidelines were put together by the state's accelerateSC advisory team, as well as the state Department of Health and Human Services.
   
 The guidelines state that "it is very important that all members of this industry understand that while these guidelines are voluntary, it is in everyone's best interest to diligently follow them as we move to re-open our economy and keep it open. All employers are responsible for providing a safe and healthy workplace."
   
 During a press conference last week, Gov. Henry McMaster said customers will likely favor businesses that comply with the safety guidelines, and those that are reckless and don't comply could face lawsuits if someone gets sick.
   
 The state's three or more rule is also still in effect, allowing law enforcement to disperse and charge people with a crime if they pose a public health risk.
   
 What to expect at a close-contact business
   
 Close-contact service providers include: Barber shops, hair salons, waxing salons, threading salons, nail salons and spas, body-art facilities and tattoo services, tanning salons, massage-therapy establishments and massage services.
   
 Workstations could have physical barriers between them and be spaced six feet apart. They should be cleaned and disinfected after each customer.
   
 Employees should be trained on sanitation and how to use personal protective equipment
   
 Employees and customers should wear face masks or cloth face coverings when possible
   
 Service providers should wear protective gloves and dispose them between each client. Other PPE should be available when necessary, like gowns
   
 Services should be by appointment only, meaning no walk-in customers
   
 Payments should not be made in cash
   
 Common areas including lobby areas, bathrooms and frequently touched surfaces, tools and equipment should be cleaned and disinfected before opening for the day and between each customer
   
 Businesses should have a procedure for entering the building and have a limit for the number of people inside, depending on the building size
   
 Customers should be screened before entering a building, including a temperature check and screening form
   
 Customers should also sanitize their hands when they enter, and between each service
   
 Appointments may be staggered to minimize or eliminate customers in waiting areas
   
 Virtual booking systems for reservations, check-ins and check-outs may be used
