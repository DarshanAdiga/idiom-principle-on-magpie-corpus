Besides declaring support for masks as a way to fight the pandemic, he admonished young people against crowding bars and spreading the disease.
 It all marked a delayed recognition by Trump that the economic reopening he's been championing since April — and, more importantly, his reelection — were imperiled by spiking cases nationwide.
 There were no guarantees how long Trump's more measured tone, delivered with an eye to halting a campaign-season erosion of support, would last. Along the way Tuesday, the president still worked in jabs at the news media and Democrats for focusing on disease-fighting shortcomings in the U.S. as the rest of world also struggles with the virus. He also belatedly addressed bipartisan criticism of virus-testing delays that have hampered reopening plans.
 “It will probably unfortunately get worse before it gets better,” Trump said from the White House. But he also touted a reduction in deaths and progress on vaccines and treatments for COVID-19, which he referred to repeatedly as a the “China virus.” He continued his recent encouragement of Americans to wear masks when social distancing is not possible.
 “Whether you like the mask or not, they have an impact," he said. "I’m getting used to the mask,” he added, pulling one out after months of suggesting that mask-wearing was a political statement against him.
 Swaths of the country are now battling rising infections and growing deaths, and some states are once again having to close businesses and rethink school in the fall. Many retailers themselves are insisting their customers don masks.
 For months, the nation’s top health experts have pleaded with Americans to wear masks in public and steer clear of crowds -- calling those simple steps life-saving -- even as the president’s stance fueled a partisan social divide.
 The early evening show at the White House came as the next stage of the federal government’s response to the pandemic was being crafted on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers and White House officials were opening negotiations on a trillion-dollar-or-more “phase four” rescue package.
 For weeks, White House aides have pressed Trump to grow more disciplined in his public statements about the pandemic. On Tuesday, he steered clear of what has been a favored talking point: that widespread testing for the virus in the U.S. “created” more cases, as aides noted that was false and projected a lack of responsibility.
 Little more than three months from Election Day, Trump and his political team hoped that the podium spotlight would give him an edge against Democratic rival Joe Biden.
 “The vaccines are coming, and they're coming a lot sooner than anybody thought possible,” Trump promised anew.
 As early as next week, the first possible U.S. vaccine is set to begin final- stage testing in a study of 30,000 people to see if it really is safe and effective. A few other vaccines have begun smaller late-stage studies in other countries, and in the U.S. a series of huge studies are planned to start each month through fall in hopes of, eventually, having several vaccines to use. Already, people can start signing up to volunteer for the different studies.

Bigelow said that he believes the retrofitting work can be completed by this fall and that the boat can start helping people study sharks by next spring. The boat will be called Orca III because there were actually two vessels in “Jaws" — Orca and Orca II. Orca is seen in much of the film, and Orca II was a prop vessel.
 Others working on the mission to bring back the Orca have a connection to “Jaws,” too. Joe Alves, production designer on the movie, is on board, as is Chris Crawford, who retrofitted a boat called Warlock into the original Orca in 1974.
 The conservation group Beneath The Waves has signed on to use the new Orca on expeditions. The group's board of directors includes Wendy Benchley, widow of Peter Benchley, who wrote the 1974 novel on which the movie is based.
 “The return of the Orca is a celebration for the fans of ‘Jaws,’ as well as an exciting new resource in the pursuit of a greater understanding about our oceans and the life teeming in it,” she said.

Twenty-one Republican governors sent a letter this week to congressional leaders arguing that businesses, health care workers and schools need lawsuit protections because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis did not sign on.
 Congress is considering another COVID-19 relief package, and many Republicans contend that liability protections need to be part of any legislation that is ultimately passed and sent to President Donald Trump.
 “To accelerate reopening our economies as quickly and as safely as possible, we must allow citizens to get back to their livelihoods and make a living for their families without the threat of frivolous lawsuits,” the letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer said. “As public policymakers, it is our duty to provide clarity, consistency, and stability to our citizens and their businesses, and the uniformity that federal law provides is critical to America’s industries that work across state lines.”
 DeSantis’ office didn’t immediately respond to The News Service of Florida’s request for comment or explain why he didn't sign onto the document, which was touted by the  Republican Governors Association  . DeSantis was one of five Republican governors who did not sign on to the request, along with the governors of Georgia, Massachusetts, South Dakota and Vermont.
 It wasn’t the first time that DeSantis, who is an attorney, has been mum on the issue of lawsuit protections.
 DeSantis received letters in April from associations representing hospitals and nursing homes asking him to issue an executive order protecting their members from liability amid the pandemic. The Florida Health Care Association, the state’s largest nursing-home association, sent a  letter  to DeSantis on April 3 requesting he provide nursing homes with civil and criminal protections, including safeguards from suits stemming from staffing or resource shortages.
 Florida Health Care Association spokeswoman Kristen Knapp on Tuesday declined to comment on this week's letter. “We’re going to keep our focus on ensuring our facilities have the resources they need to keep their residents safe and protected right now,” Knapp said in an emailed statement to the News Service.
 The Florida Hospital Association sent a  similar letter  to DeSantis on April 22 requesting that he temporarily provide legal protections to hospitals. The association proposed that the protections from civil and criminal suits last through Oct. 1. Attempts to contact the hospital association Tuesday were not immediately successful.
 The first groups to ask DeSantis for protections amid the pandemic were doctors. The Florida Medical Association and the Florida Osteopathic Medical Association joined with the Florida Justice Reform Institute, an organization that focuses on lawsuit limits, and asked DeSantis in March to issue an executive order limiting liability and providing sovereign immunity protections for doctors who were complying with emergency orders that shut down optional health-care services. The letter also asked DeSantis to extend the state’s “Good Samaritan Act” to apply to physicians working during the pandemic.
 DeSantis did not issue any of the requested executive orders and avoided answering media questions about the requests.
 Attempts to limit lawsuits --- an issue commonly known as tort reform --- often spur fierce political battles in Tallahassee, with plaintiffs’ attorneys squaring off against business and health-care groups. Opponents of such limits generally contend that they penalize people who are injured because of the actions of businesses or health-care providers.
 Despite DeSantis’ lack of action on the issue during the pandemic, Florida Justice Reform Institute President William Large said Tuesday that legal protections still are necessary.
 In part, Large said a timeframe people have to file lawsuits against businesses or health care providers should be shortened from the current four years to one year. Large also said evidentiary standards and culpability standards also need to be heightened to provide protections businesses need.
 While DeSantis didn’t approve the requests, Large said he remains optimistic that the governor supports lawsuit protections.
 “The first opportunity the Legislature addresses any subject dealing with COVID-19, such as the budget, we will ask for appropriate liability (protections) ” Large said.

"You've got to recognise that. You may not agree with it, but listen to it.
 "I would love to see it maintained, in a place of safety, in a heritage centre, with the history of the last few months about the controversy of it to be well explained.
 "That's also part of Ashbourne's history, and long may it remain and open and welcoming town."
 However, Councillor Denise Brown was quick to point out that the controversy surrounding the head began shortly after the murder of George Floyd in America, and at the start of the Black Lives Matter Protests, and no complaints had been made before.
 She said: "That head dates back to the 1600s and nobody had complained about it before.
 "Suddenly we get a Neo-Marxist group and everybody jumps on the band-wagon.
 "If we had had three of four complaints a fortnight before all this unrest and protest happened, we would have been able to discuss this rationally and look at it properly. But we're being pigeon-holed."
 After a lengthy debate, councillors agreed to begin discussions with Derbyshire Dales District Council about taking possession of the head and the Green Man gallows sign as soon as possible, with a view to it eventually finding a place in a heritage centre.
 There are several theories behind the history of the head, with some believing it depicts a servant who accompanied either Sir Walter Raleigh or lexicographer Samuel Johnson on visits to Ashbourne.
 Others believe it may have paid tribute to a Turkish coffee merchant, or may have even been a fertility symbol. Evidence has also emerged that it could be derived from a coat of arms.

CHARLESTON, S.C. (WCSC) - The Children's Museum of the Lowcountry is planning an expansion of an outdoor area and improvements to its current historic building.The city's Planning Director, Jacob Lindsey,&nbsp; says he's excited about this expansion that plans to gives the city's only children's museum more space outdoors. He says the previous outdoor space around the building was not very big and not well used.The museum says they are planning to add a creative canopy that resembles the children's game of "pick up sticks."&nbsp;"The design is really a playful one and is colorful and different from anything else that you'll find in the city," Lindsey said.&nbsp; He added that there will be a new, permanent roof over the outdoor area as well as&nbsp;a fence that surrounds this area in order to keep it more private and safe.Once it gets full approval for the outdoor shade and interior renovation, it could start construction.Lindsay says the outdoor space is going to be next to the museum on Ann Street, and will run the whole length of the block between King Street and Meeting Street.The Children’s Museum’s historic building has never gone through rehabilitation, but organizers say they are excited to finally get this underway after about two years of planning.The city says they are also planning for an interior re-work of the facilities and programs indoors.These additions are up for preliminary approval at the Board of Architectural Review Wednesday. Once it gets full approval for the outdoor shade and interior renovation, it could start construction.Copyright 2020 WCSC. All rights reserved.

EGLIN AFB -- Just days after making a broad case to Eglin Air Force Base personnel and the wider community about the need to get a handle on the rising number of local COVID-19 cases, Brig. Gen. Scott Cain, 96th Test Wing commander and also the base commander, talked in some additional depth Monday about the conversations he's had with local elected officials and business leaders in connection with the pandemic.
   
 RELATED: COVID-19 adversely affecting missions at Eglin AFB
   
 In those conversations, Cain said in a telephone interview, he has stressed what the base has done -- wearing masks, practicing social distancing, watching for signs of illness and avoiding the assembling of large crowds -- to keep its own COVID-19 numbers down.
   
 Cain said a number of his conversations have come with members of the community's Military Affairs Committees, organizations of the local Chambers of Commerce that serve as a link between the community and its military installations.
      
 Okaloosa County Commission Chairman Trey Goodwin and Okaloosa County Administrator John Hofstad said Monday that they had not yet had any direct conversations with Cain about the community's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 Seth Luttrelll, director of operations for the Greater Fort Walton Beach Chamber of Commerce, said Monday that the community had had outreach from other Air Force officials, including Maj. Gen. Christopher Azzano, a former Eglin commander now serving as commander of the Air Force Test Center at California's Edwards Air Force Base, about how to prepare airmen for service in the time of COVID-19.
   
 As of Monday, according to the latest state data available, just 16 positive COVID-19 cases have been recorded on Eglin AFB itself. That number is, however, up by four cases since Friday, when a total of just 12 positive COVID-19 cases had been recorded. And the base has seen a steadily upward trend since April, when just a single COVID-19 case was listed as originating on the base..
   
 "We have been preventing COVID on the base for four months," Cain asserted Monday.
   
 Meanwhile, Okaloosa County, which hosts the main portion of the sprawling installation, had logged 1,973 positive COVID-19 cases as of Monday, according to state data. That's an increase of 275 cases from Friday, when the total number of positive cases in the county stood at 1,698.
   
 Further detailing his conversations with local officials and business leaders, Cain said he has stressed that COVID-19 "is a risk to all of us," but with regard to Eglin AFB, that risk has implications for national defense.
   
 As such, Cain said, he has reminded those local leaders that "national defense is a priority for all of us."
   
 As was the case with his Facebook video address to Eglin personnel and the wider community last week, Cain would not go into specific detail with regard to how COVID-19 is affecting the base's mission, which includes air-launched weapons evaluation and development .
   
 Cain did, however, say that military travel restrictions imposed as a result of the high number of local positive COVID-19 cases has adversely affected Eglin missions, because of the fact that a number of those missions involve units associated with Eglin-based units that are located elsewhere in the country.
   
 And on the base itself, Cain said, the logistics and personnel services that are part of the 96th Test Wing's responsibilities as the host unit for the installation are becoming increasingly more focused on COVID-19-related issues.
   
 The base hospital, Cain said, is "deferring common kinds of care" as a result of COVID-19. Cain did not say if, or how many, COVID-19 cases were being treated at the base hospital, referring to the service-wide data that is all that is being released currently by the Air Force. But one positive result of the medical issues created by COVID-19 at the base is that medical personnel are "making a lot of advances in virtual care (assessing patients via digital links instead of at the facility itself," Cain noted.
   
 Cain said he has offered no specific suggestions to community leadership in terms of how it should respond to the ongoing rise in COVID-19 cases, other than pointing out the base's tough posture against spread of the coronavirus.
   
 And, Cain said, regardless of what happens with efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19, Eglin AFB is "preparing, and prepared, to operate in this environment" until a vaccine is developed or the coronavirus is otherwise brought under control.

Jackie said: “Necessary social distancing measures mean businesses are unable to trade at normal levels. The effects of this are already being seen, with some workers having been laid off in spite of government support.
 “A hospitality unemployment crisis could cause serious damage – not just for the workers laid off, but for everyone in my constituency. With almost 8000 workers employed in the sector across West Dunbartonshire and Argyll and Bute, the local economy depends on hospitality jobs, and our local hospitality sector needs jobs for good. Extending the furlough scheme in this sector could provide a lifeline to thousands of workers.
 “The Scottish Government must step up the fight to save these jobs. Businesses need greater support to make the adaptations they need to accommodate greater social distancing, allowing them to keep more staff on their books. A quality jobs guarantee scheme could stimulate demand as well, so that when the furlough scheme ends in other sectors workers can still afford to visit restaurants and bars.”
 A Scottish Government spokesperson responded saying the hospitality industry is “vital to our economy”.

Market Dynamics:   The development of specialty cheese with high nutritional content and long shelf life is resulting in significant growth of packaged sales across the globe. The use of cheese surged in household food preparations, particularly across Europe and North America owing to the consumer demand for dairy formulations. Major food processors are highly interested towards use of cheese as an ingredient in broad range of recipes including pizza, burgers, pasta, salads, sandwiches, appetizers, breads, soups, and sauces. Cheese is used as a topping in pizza, sauces in pasta, fillings in appetizers, and slices in hamburgers. Increased consumption of cheese across food manufacturing, food service, and catering service is another factor contributing to the growth of cheese market globally. Additionally, growing establishments of western food outlets in developing countries across the Asia-Pacific region and increased consumption of cheese-based products by these food outlets are contributing to the growth of cheese in this region. According to Department of International Trade, exports of British cheese into Asia in 2018 reached USD 68.96 million, which is 10% of total cheese exports value.   However, presence of health risks associated with consumption of cheese such as breast cancer, heart attacks, and respiratory issues is the major factor hindering the growth of cheese market globally.   Segment Analysis   Global cheese market is segmented into various types such as fresh cheese, soft cheese, semi-soft cheese, hard cheese, blue cheese and others. Semi-soft cheese segment is dominating the global cheese market owing to the popularity and consumption of Mozzarella cheese across the globe. Mozzarella is a southern Italian cheese derived from Buffalo milk and is used widely in pizza and lasagna preparations owing to its stretching property. Mozzarella is also used as filling in sandwiches and can also be eaten fresh with seasonings. The rising demand for pizza and sandwiches and the growing food service industry is likely to surge the utilization of mozzarella cheese in future. According to United States Department of Agriculture, per capita consumption of Mozzarella increased from 10.66 pounds in 2007 to 11.57 pounds in 2017 in U.S.   Geographical Presentation   North America is dominating the global cheese market owing to consumer appetite towards cheese in the U.S. and Canada. According to the data published in USDA Dairy consumption, the per capita consumption of Cheese in the U.S. increased from 38.5 pounds in 2016 to 39 pounds in 2017. The annual growth of cheese consumption in the country can be attributable to the shift in consumer preference towards prepared food. The demand for cheese is significantly increasing in both household and food service applications. The high acceptance rate of ethnic cooking such as Italian and Mexican foods in U.S. households led to the growth in utilization of cheese. The rising cheese production in the country is supporting the growth of cheese market in the region. According to International Dairy Foods Association, Cheese production in the U.S. increased from 12.64 billion pounds in 2016 to 13.02 billion pounds in 2017, an increase of 1.5%.   China is expected to the largest market for cheese by the end of 2025 owing to the surging demand for cheese and cheese-based products such as pasta, cheeseburgers, pizza and cheesecakes in the country. According to the U.S. Dairy Export Council, cheese imports in China surged more than 50-fold from 2,000 metric tons in 2000 to 108,000 metric tons in 2017 and the growth was significantly high in the past decade. The increasing upper-middle class population and free-spending millennial are the major consumer groups for cheese products in the country. The growth in e-commerce food service, adoption of western dietary habits, and increasing utilization of cheese in Chinese culinary recipes ae the key growth factors for Cheese market in China. China evolved as the largest partner for the U.S. dairy industry with rapidly growing cheese imports. However, the worsening trade relations and newly posed tariffs may adversely affect the market.   Competitive Analysis   The major players in global cheese market are focusing on acquiring regional players and their production plants to improve their production capabilities, thereby improving their product portfolio in respective region. For instance, in November 2019, Saputo Inc. acquired F&A Dairy Products Inc. and its two manufacturing plants in Wisconsin and New Mexico to improve its dairy portfolio in the U.S.   This market is also experiencing new product launches in specialty cheese segment to meet the consumer requirements across the globe. For instance, In May 2019, Savenica Cheese USA, LLC, a specialty cheese manufacturer launched Supreme a new addition to its range of specialty cheese under the brand Brie

 Somers Point City Council recently voted to oppose the plan to close Exit 30, and Ocean City Council may take a similar stance, Ocean City spokesman Doug Bergen said.

 Somers Point Mayor Jack Glasser said there are many problems with the new route, including adding unacceptable levels of traffic to already busy Route 9 and Somers Point-Mays Landing Road.
 “I know we have problems on Laurel Drive, and we have asked the state to set weight limits (on vehicles that can use it), and to provide grants to redo the street,” Glasser said as he stood at the corner of Route 9 and Somers Point- Mays Landing Road, a small intersection that would have to handle more parkway traffic if the plan becomes reality. “But the problems on Laurel Drive don’t compare to the problems that will happen if they shift everything over here.”

Alarcon was playing in the second of what would be three Porter Cups and was hoping to improve on his tie for eighth in 1978. A native of Guadalajara, Mexico, he had already won two tournaments on the summer amateur schedule and continued playing well as his opening 68 and follow-up 66 would attest. At 6-under par, he had a four-stroke lead after 36 holes and had added another stroke to his advantage in the third round.
 While Alarcon was a respected player and considered a solid contender, the tournament spotlight belonged to John Cook, Bobby Clampett and Gary Hallberg.
 Cook, 21, a senior at Ohio State and winner of the U.S. Amateur in 1978, had won the Ohio, Sunnehanna and Northeast amateurs in 1979 and was the medalist in the Broadmoor Invitational. He had finished 39th in the Masters, was low amateur in the U.S. Open, was co-champion of the Big Ten Tournament and finished 13th in the NCAA. As he said later, “It was quite a summer.”
 He had tied for sixth, nine strokes behind Clampett in the 1978 Porter Cup. That was the year the Brigham Young star opened with a 75, pondered withdrawing and then set a course and tournament record with an 8-under 62 the next day. A 70 and a 65 put the finishing touches on a two-stroke victory over Jay Sigel.
 Hallberg, Wake Forest’s best player and the individual champion at the NCAA tournament in June, had played for the victorious 1979 U.S. Walker Cup team and had won the North and South tourney in Pinehurst, N.C. He was high on the list as a potential Porter Cup champion. He tied for fifth in 1977.
 Bob Tway, a teammate of Alarcon’s at Oklahoma State, played with him in the second round and even with a 66 said he had seen him play better. “He keeps the ball in play, he’s a good putter and he thinks well. He doesn’t hit any dumb shots.”
 Historic collapse
 Whether they were “dumb shots” or not, the shots Alarcon started to hit at the par-5 13th hole that day in the third round ignited an historic collapse unmatched in Porter Cup history.
 He bogeyed four consecutive holes to fall to 1-under for the tournament, but the worst was yet to come. The narrow fairway at the par-4 17th hole has seen a number of players hit out of bounds over the years and Alarcon did it twice on his way the a quintuple-bogey 9.
 Shaken by that, he pounded his tee shot over the green at the 180-yard par-3 hole, adding a triple bogey to his implosion. In the final six holes, he went from 5-under par to 7-over, a swing of 12 strokes. He shot 83, 47 on a back nine where he posted a 32 the day before. He dropped into a tie for 19th.
 Stunned by it all, Alarcon tried to make light of demolishing his championship hopes while talking to reporters but Tway, standing with him, said “It’s not all right.”
 Calling it the worst six holes he had ever played, Alarcon said “I couldn’t understand what was going on. I still can’t. There’s always tomorrow. A 59 would be okay.”
 Strong winds figured in higher scores and Hallberg was the only one to put up a red number, a 69 that left him 2-over and leading the tournament by one over Clampett, who oddly enough gained ground with a 73. He was six behind going into the third round and Hallberg and Cook were nine back. Now, to their surprise, they were bunched within two strokes at the top of the leader board.
 Hallberg was bubbling with joy. “I’m very surprised I’m leading. I didn’t wish any bad luck on my opponents, but the golf course was overpowering. No one could handle it today.”
 Clampett was upset about Alarcon’s demise. “Ralph is a good friend of mine. It bothered me to see him playing so wild. He’s had a good season and I wanted to see him play well.”
 Celebrity match-up
 The final lineup delighted Tournament Director Bill McMahon and his assistant Ed Rozek. They weren’t about to pass up the chance to pair that year’s most celebrated amateur players in the final group.
 “I remember playing that final round with Bobby and Gary,” Cook said years later. “I played with Bobby a little bit on tour, and Gary, but that was the only time we were ever paired.”

Governor Cooper's decision in mid-March to shut down public school attendance and instead initiate remote learning in response to the coronavirus pandemic, left many teachers, students and parents dissatisfied. The governor compounded the problem in July when he delayed his decision on which of three plans would be utilized for attendance in public schools. The three plans articulated in "Strong School NC Public Health Tookit" had either Plan A with full enrollment, Plan B with hybrid enrollment utilizing remote learning or Plan C with no in class enrollment with all classes meeting remotely.
 On July 14, with only five weeks before students were to return to school, the governor finally announced he is instituting Plan B in most cases and that Plan C would be acceptable as deemed appropriate by local school boards.

The new Richard Walker’s Pancake House is now fulfilling breakfast cravings at Flower Hill Promenade in Del Mar.
 Richard Walker Jr. owns this fourth San Diego location of the family-owned and operated restaurants. The former coffee shop space inside Flower Hill has been completely transformed with a 50/50 blend of indoor and outdoor seating, vaulted ceilings with skylights and the restaurant’s signature stained glass.
 Just like the downtown location owned by his father and Walker Jr.’s two locations in La Jolla and Carlsbad, their traditional pancakes start with fresh buttermilk batter, a recipe passed down over generations in flavors like blueberry, cherry, banana, fresh strawberry and Georgia pecan—those who cannot bring themselves to pick just one can opt for a pancake flight with their choice of three.
 The menu includes over 100 items made from scratch daily including the Northern Bacon pancake stuffed with real chopped bacon; the giant baked German pancake comes sprinkled in powdered sugar; and the cant-miss baked apple pancake with fresh Granny Smith apple slices and imported pure cinnamon glaze: “It’s what put us on the map,” said Walker Jr.
 Many of the delicious pancake flavors also come in Belgian waffle form and the menu also includes 20 different egg dishes and sweet and savory gourmet crepes. Walker said you can’t go wrong with an order of their special recipe, thick-sliced bacon.

An Indian-origin executive who has worked across leading public and private sector firms in the UK has been selected as the new Chair of Highways England, the British government-owned company charged with operating, maintaining and improving England's highways and major road infrastructure. Dipesh J Shah was chosen after a competitive process to lead the government's ambitious plans to level up road infrastructure across the country, the UK's Department of Transport said as it confirmed the new appointment on Tuesday. I am honoured to be invited to chair Highways England, which plays a pivotal role in connecting communities across England, said Shah. I look forward to working with colleagues to deliver the very significant programme of improvement and expansion of the road network in support of the government's levelling-up agenda, he said. Shah will take up his new role from September 1 and will be responsible for the delivery of the UK government's second five- year road investment strategy. The 27-billion pound strategy, known as RIS2, began in April 2020 and will further improve the safety, reliability and connectivity of England's strategic road network, Highways England said. It said Shah brings extensive experience from both the public and private sectors, having chaired several organisations including a listed power utility, housing association and the European industry association for solar. He has also served on the boards of Thames Water, Babcock International and the Crown Estate, as well as on boards in the infrastructure, financial services and energy sectors. Shah was formerly the CEO of the UK Atomic Energy Authority, having earlier held several senior positions at BP. This government is determined to build our way out of COVID-19, providing the infrastructure, jobs and skills needed to support our economy, said UK Roads Minister Baroness Charlotte Vere. I am delighted that Dipesh Shah will be leading the Highways England team at this crucial time, delivering major projects that will really make a difference to communities across the country, she said. Shah takes over from Colin Matthews, who has led the organisation since 2014 through a period dubbed as one of significant change , from its initial establishment as a government-owned company through to its delivery of the RIS1 programme and subsequent plans for RIS2.

In Florida, Miami-Dade County has 82 shelters with 112,000 spaces without social distancing and is also negotiating with hotels. For smaller storms, the county's director of emergency management, Frank Rollason, says he plans to open double the number of shelters he normally would in order to spread people out. But for a Category 3 hurricane or stronger, he says he could need every last one of those 112,000 spaces. Expanding capacity outside of that is limited because not every building is strong enough to withstand a hurricane. And the stronger the storm, the more people who would need to evacuate.
 Other details, including staffing and health-screening protocols, also must be worked out with hotels. And it's unclear who will get available hotel rooms. In Florida, county emergency managers will decide. Some say they are reserving their rooms for people who have tested positive for the coronavirus or are at high risk for contracting COVID-19. Emergency managers in other states say that decisions about who gets rooms could be made at the last minute.
