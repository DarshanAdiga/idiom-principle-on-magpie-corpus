 ©Reuters Protest in assistance of Mapuche neighborhoods members who have actually been put behind bars and on cravings strike, in Santiago   __   2/2 __
 SANTIAGO (Reuters) - The Office of the United Nations' High Commissioner for Human Rights validated on Saturday that it had actually sent out a fact- finding team to Chile's restive Araucania area where an imprisoned native Mapuche leader has actually invested more than 100 days on cravings strike over his detention throughout the coronavirus pandemic.
 The OHCHR stated in a communique that its team had actually checked out the health center in the local capital Temuco where Celestino Cordova was being dealt with in addition to jails where a minimum of 20 other Mapuche convicts are on cravings strike.
 It stated it had actually satisfied authorities, district attorneys and company agents, and native leaders who laid claims of forced expulsions from council residential or commercial property, extreme or unneeded usage of force by the authorities and racial discrimination.

Chapman suggests starting your day off with something that allows you to chat and connect, like enjoying a cup of coffee before work. Likewise, find a meaningful way to come back together at the end of the day. "After work, set aside 10 minutes to catch up—no phones allowed," Chapman recommends. This will help you both unwind after the workday and talk about your day.
 Of course, not all schedules will allow this, but planning for those times during the day when you can just be together and connect is important if your partner's love language is quality time.

So many rooms hold memories of getting in trouble, I realized. Isn’t that just the way of childhood?
 On the second floor, the built-in bedroom wall closets, which felt absolutely palatial as a child, were smaller than I remembered. In my memories, I built huge forts in those closets, with furniture, stuffed animal friends, and each end a different room. Impossible. I must have had some imagination back in those days.
 I pondered if I’d still be able to stretch the phone cord from the hallway into the bathroom. I used to sit on a foot stool next to the sink and talk on the phone to boys. Apparently in my mind, the bathroom door was more soundproof than my bedroom door. Or, more probably, farther from my parents' room. I looked in the hallway. No more phone outlet.
 The bluestone basement had been refinished, so the weird little rooms and hiding places were gone, but the steep, creaky back staircase still felt perilous to descend, so that felt comfortingly familiar. In the yard, our rhubarb patch was gone, as was the tree I once loved to climb, but the window wells I once used as “dressing rooms” for costume changes during the many plays put on in the backyard were still the original structures. They, for some reason, still seemed huge in ways the closets did not. I could still visualize a child hanging a costume shirt at the edge, jumping in and imagining it as a vast room where they could ready themselves for their upcoming act.
 I could write an entire book of these memories, all stemming from an hour-long visit made almost three decades after the last time I’d stepped foot inside. Some are good, some are bad (seriously, did I get in _that_ much trouble?), but they all made me into who I am today. It’s good to revisit them once in a while.

London and its environs are home to a notable diversity of faiths and flocks. Rites that have been the bedrock of their beliefs for centuries had to evolve swiftly during the pandemic lockdown to be safe and relevant for the faithful amid global uncertainty.
   
 In the Hertfordshire county village of Northchurch, Anglicans normally worship in the more than 1,000-year-old St. Mary's Church. That ended March 24 when the Church of England closed all its buildings, and Canon Rev. Jonathan Gordon began recording and broadcasting weekly services via smartphone with the help of Rachel Gordon, his wife.
   
 "It posed an immediate and immense challenge," the Rev. Gordon said. "It meant that we had to completely rethink how we did everything."
   
 In Neasden, a suburb northwest of London, a magnificent Hindu temple of carved stone constructed according to ancient Vedic architectural texts usually welcomes thousands of visitors a day. Now the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir gets just a trickle of devotees who book appointments online first to keep the crowds down and are told to wear face masks.
   
 Everywhere there are reminders of the unusual times: Instead of donation boxes, smart screen devices flashing images of Hindu deities allow for contactless donations, and after each prayer session, workers in full-body protective suits swoop in to spray and sanitize any surface that may have been touched.
   
 On a recent day at a suburban home in Hemel Hempstead, three female members of the Patel family dressed in their best saris watched attentively in their living room as Hindu swamis and gurus spoke to them through their video screen. "That is what we would have worn to the temple," said Hemali Patel, "so it felt only right to dress for the occasion."
   
 Taking worship services virtual has been particularly challenging for the Orthodox Jewish community, members of which are proscribed from using electronics on Shabbat, their day of rest. Rabbi Mordechai Chalk broadcasts video services from his home Fridays just before sunset, as Shabbat nears.
   
 "L'chaim," he toasted in Hebrew recently, connected to the congregation via Zoom. His children ran into the picture in their pajamas to peer curiously at his laptop, before Shira Chalk, his wife, whisked them away for a bedtime story.
   
 Nestled in the Chiltern Hills northwest of London, the Buddhist Amvrati monastery decided to simply close its doors and retreat inward to protect the communal way of life of its yellow-robed monks.
   
 The monastery, whose name translates from the sacred Buddhist language of Pali as "deathless realm," takes delivery drops at the back gate, and it took multiple rounds of negotiations before an AP journalist was allowed to enter, wearing a mask and gloves and observing strict social distancing.
   
 Spokesman Ajahn Dhammanando said the reopening of the temple as the United Kingdom emerges from coronavirus lockdowns will happen with the utmost caution to avoid spreading COVID-19, and for the time being only for certain functions such as funeral ceremonies.
   
 At the Cambridge Central Mosque in the city of the same name, Imam Ali Tos has found solace in a slow reopening and the mosque's essential role in the lives of the faithful. Mats are now spaced a meter and a half apart during communal prayers, and worshippers are asked to bring their own. People's names and numbers are meticulously collected for possible contact-tracing purposes.
   
 "The mosque is not only a place of worship for Muslims," the imam said, "it is the center of our lives."
   
 Rabbi David Mason, who heads an Orthodox synagogue in North London, recalled going to a Jewish cemetery to preside over a funeral and being "aghast" at the rows of new graves, often several people being interred the same day.
   
 "It really hit me, you know, the number of dead that we've got," Mason said. "And that's one cemetery of many."
   
 But religions have endured trauma countless times before, and indeed, many of the tenets of faith held dear today were born out of hardship and suffering. And today's pandemic has not been without its lighter moments.
   
 Mason said he took joy from knowing tech-savvy volunteers were spending hours on the phone patiently helping older community members get online for services.
   
 "My high point during lockdown was when a 90-year-old lady came onto a Sunday night talk and explained how delighted she was," the rabbi said. "That's how communal collaboration works. I watched it work, and it was just wonderful."
