"I've been around coaching pretty much my whole life and I've always known it's something I wanted to do," Spaziani said during a telephone interview. "It was tough to stop playing, for sure.
 "I don't think any coach says, 'I wish I would've quit playing earlier.' But I'm happy. I think I was ready to make the switch."
 Spaziani knew exactly what he was getting into when joined Virginia's staff. His father, Frank, is a veteran coach who spent nine years as an assistant at Virginia (1982-91) and time in the CFL as a defensive co-ordinator with Winnipeg (1992-93) and Calgary (1994-96).
 Frank Spaziani also spent 16 years with Boston College, including four as head coach (2009-12). He's currently New Mexico State's defensive co-ordinator.
 "I thought it was one of the coolest things that he was a coach," Joe Spaziani said. "I thought that was such an awesome profession where you get to help young men train and be a leader of a team . . . it's such a unique thing.
 "Growing up I always loved football and watching him do it at a high level was very cool."
 Spaziani appeared in 30 career games at Virginia as a long-snapper before graduating in 2018 with a foreign affairs degree. He added a master’s in higher education in 2019.
 Toronto selected Spaziani in the sixth round of the '19 CFL draft. He appeared in seven regular-season games with the Argos (4-14).
 "We didn't have a great season but I had such a great experience," Spaziani said. "I got to play in the Touchdown Atlantic game (28-22 loss to Montreal in Moncton, N.B.) and see the East Coast, I got to go to Winnipeg and Regina and get back to Calgary for the first time since I was basically a baby and play in Vancouver.
 "I also got to experience how great a city Toronto is from a local's perspective . . . it was awesome. I couldn't have asked for a better experience."
 But a return to Virginia, reuniting with Mendenhall and starting a new football journey were too good for Spaziani to pass up.
 "It was really tough to call (Argos director of scouting Vince Magri) and tell him I was retiring," Spaziani said. "I knew if I ever had the chance that I'd love to be back at my alma mater and with coach Mendenhall's staff.

Minister of National Defence of the Republic of Turkey, Hulusi Akar, graced the occasion as chief guest. The ceremony was attended by Minister for Defence Production, Zubaida Jalal and Chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral Muhammad Amjad Khan Niazi. While addressing the ceremony, the chief guest termed Keel laying of PN MILGEM Corvette as a historic event for Ministry of Defence Production, Pakistan Navy, KS&EW; and M/s ASFAT of Turkey. He appreciated the commitment and dedication of M/s ASFAT (Turkish state owned Defence Firm) and KS&EW; for construction of technologically advanced Corvette. The Chief Guest also marked that Turkey stands in solidarity for Pakistan’s principle stance over Kashmir issue and Azerbaijan conflict.
 Speaking on the occasion, Minister for Defence Production Zubaida Jalal also appreciated the performance of Karachi Shipyard and underlined that indigenization is forefront of our policy. She underscored that it is convincing to see state of the art warship is being built in Pakistan.
 The MILGEM Class Corvettes will be one of the most technologically advanced stealth surface platforms of Pakistan Navy Fleet. The vessel is equipped with state of the art weapons & modern sensors including surface to surface, surface to air missiles, anti-submarine weapons and Command & Control system. Induction of these ship in Pakistan Navy would significantly add to the lethality of Pakistan Navy’s capabilities and contribute in maintaining peace, security and balance of power in Indian Ocean Region.
 Earlier, the MD KS&EW; Rear Admiral Ather Saleem welcomed the distinguished guests and highlighted that Karachi Shipyard is fully cognizant and aligned with the goals set forth by the Government and Pakistan Navy to pursue self- reliance in Defence Shipbuilding Industry. He emphasized that deep rooted friendship with brotherly country Turkey for this mega project will open new vistas of further cooperation in the field of indigenous warship construction and other defence sectors in Pakistan.

US policymakers continued to hold talks Monday on a new spending package to aid the virus-hit economy, but the negotiations have lost momentum, dimming hopes that an agreement can be reached before the November 3 election.
 With Covid-19 cases on the rise nationwide, the need for stimulus has taken on a new urgency, especially as many support programs have expired or are about to, including a moratorium on foreclosures and evictions as well as loans for small businesses, which threatens to spark a wave of bankruptcies and homelessness.
 "The talks have certainly slowed down, but they're not ending," White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Monday on CNBC.
 After months of negotiations between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, time has nearly run out to get stimulus approved before President Donald Trump stands for re-election next week.
 Whether a measure can be approved in the "lame duck" session before the new Congress is seated in January is unclear.
 "We're close, but there are still important policy issues that separate us and our team believes there have to be more compromises on the House side for us to get there," Kudlow said.
 A source familiar with the discussions told AFP AFP Pelosi and Mnuchin will speak by telephone at 1800 GMT.
 The sides have narrowed their differences on the size of a package to around $2 trillion, but remain at odds over the exact cost and what it includes, with Republicans pressing for more limited measures and Democrats insisting on aid for state and local governments.
 Wall Street fell on the downbeat comments, with the Dow trading 2.5 percent lower around 1545 GMT.
 \- 'Crush the virus' -
 Kudlow continued to tout a solid economic recovery from the damage inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic and widespread business shutdowns, which he said will be "self-sustaining" even without a new stimulus package.
 But most economists disagree, saying the world's largest economy avoided an even worse downturn only because of the nearly $3 trillion in support quickly pumped into the system in the form of expanded unemployment benefits, payroll support and loans for businesses of all sizes.
 The resurgence of the virus could make Americans reluctant to venture into stores or businesses, even without restrictions imposed by authorities, which makes the prospects for recovery uncertain at best.
 Over the weekend, Pelosi said that legislators have put stimulus wording on paper and she remains "optimistic" about the chances for approval, noting that the language in the bill can be changed to accommodate compromises with the administration.
 "I'll never give up hope," Pelosi said on CNN, adding that she aims for progress with Mnuchin regarding concerns she raised in the talks last week.
 But with cases of the virus rising, "To do anything, though, that does not crush the virus is really official malfeasance," she said. "We are still waiting for the final okay, and that is a central issue in all of this."

The push to get 5G up and running in-store doesn’t only affect the technologies that customers interact with. It can also help educate employees and prevent safety incidents. Companies in the U.S. spent 83 billion dollars on corporate training in 2019 teaching the skills employees needed to fulfill their roles. It’s unfortunate, then, that the retention rates of passive teaching methods like sitting in on a lecture or reading a manual are far lower than participatory ones. Augmented and virtual reality are potential solutions, allowing employees to go “hands-on” in a safe environment, engaging them with an immersive experience, and accelerating the learning process.

"This technology has proven its effectiveness to identify suspicious and wanted people," said Obaid al-Hathboor, director of Dubai’s Transport Security Department. The emirate already operates a biometric system using facial recognition at its international airport.
 Dubai, which sees itself as a leading "smart city" in the Middle East, has ambitions to become a hub for technology and artificial intelligence. Both sectors will be on show when it opens the multi-billion-dollar Expo fair.
 "We aspire to raise our performance by building on our current capabilities, to ensure a high level of security in metro stations and other transport sectors," said Hathboor. Earlier this week, under the watch of Dubai’s Crown Prince Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed, the city’s police used facial recognition in a simulated scenario to identify gunmen launching an attack on a metro station.
 A special police unit, trained in the United States, helped "evacuate" commuters from the station in the mock attack, before working in tandem with a control centre to apprehend the suspects. Members of the special unit will be sent to major metro stations during Expo 2020.
 The six-month event was delayed by one year due to coronavirus, and is now set to open in October 2021. It was expected to attract 15 million visitors before the global economy and transport systems were disrupted by the pandemic.
 Jamal Rashed, of Dubai Police’s Transport Security Department, said the facial recognition technology will be rolled out in the coming months in all metro stations. Other technology already in use to combat the spread of the coronavirus, such as helmets with thermal cameras and smart glasses, will also be used to identify and manage large crowds.
 "It took at least five hours to identify a suspect before," said Rashed. "With this technology, it takes less than a minute." But while the technology to identify individuals has simplified lives, such as being used for unlocking phones, it has also raised concerns over privacy.
 Berlin-based advocacy group AlgorithmWatch says that at least 10 European police forces use facial recognition technology -- a trend that privacy and rights groups are concerned about. China has also been criticised for the facial recognition systems in its public surveillance network.

 So, sure, Angie would give the sport a whirl, but if she didn't quite take to it like a fish to water, well, she had some other things going on. Like soccer and gymnastics. "I was always busy," said Angie. But when push came to shove, when one sport had to grab her for college, she made the decision.
 She plays volleyball for Bentley University.
 When Brendan Hamblet, also from Hopkinton, was pondering his hockey life, his aim was to play for a Division I college team. After a nice four years skating for the Weston-based Rivers School, several schools showed interest, although they wanted him to take a spin around the junior leagues first. "They wanted to see how I did there."
 It was tempting, but Hamblet had something else on his mind. Hockey foremost - at the risk of shortchanging his education process - was not the road he wanted to take. His patience paid off. A Div. I school called and wanted him for hockey, no strings attached.
 He's skating for Bentley University.
 Emma Guccione had been in the grips of soccer and track for a long time. "I was passionate about both," said the Holliston High graduate.
 And in high school she could satisfy both whims. But college proposed she choose one.
 She's a soccer player at Bentley University.
 Mother and daughter
 COVID-19 has squeezed everyone's guilty and well-deserved pleasures, albeit to different degrees. College athletes, to name one grouping, have seen their seasons washed away. So they do two things: pray and practice.
 "We hope to have a (volleyball) season by January or February," said Angie Grabmeier. "We had been doing conditioning outside. Now it's indoors. With masks. It's not that bad, just something we've got to get used to. We're practicing five days a week."
 Grabmeier does track, too, but that season is even less definitive. "We're not sure what's going to happen. I did the high jump in high school, and did pretty well."
 Indeed. She was a two-time league All-Star.
 Grabmeier is a freshman at Bentley. Upon her arrival on campus, she was bursting with excitement about the beginning of the college experience. Safe to say, the bountiful expectations have been bottled up. Experiences?
 "There's nothing to compare to (the pandemic)," she said.
 Grabmeier was a Tri-Valley League and Daily News volleyball All-Star in high school. The Hillers won four consecutive league titles under the tutelage of her mother. But it wasn't until eighth grade that Angie put aside gymnastics to concentrate on volleyball. "Gymnastics was hurting my body," she conceded. Time for a change.
 In seventh grade she was the volleyball manager; the next year she was a player. She looked forward to the varsity years.
 Hopkinton High had "a ton of talent," she recalled. To hone her game for the next step, Grabmeier went to volleyball camps and a lot of beach volleyball tournaments, often in Newport, R.I. "Everywhere I could find a tournament, I'd go."
 "She's always been athletic," said her mother Margie. So it was imperative that her daughter had the final say about what sport to pursue long-term.
 "Angie loved volleyball. It was something we could shape, and she had the advantage of playing club volleyball and going to camps," said Margie. "I worked with her here and there."
 There had always existed a family creed. "Just do your best in whatever you do," said Margie, who has been coaching since Angie was born.
 Angie Grabmeier considered schools near (Northeastern) and far (Ohio State) but got hooked on Bentley at first glance. "I went on a tour and loved it. I stayed overnight with the volleyball players."
 She's living alone in a freshman dorm. "It gets kind of lonely." A potential roommate is looming. And maybe a volleyball season.
 Dreams on ice
 "It was my dream to play Division one hockey," said Hamblet, a senior on the Waltham campus. Bowing to the pandemic's whims, but not ready to concede possibilities, Hamblet has heard whispers that there may be a season on the horizon for the Falcons. On Oct. 15, good news arrived when Atlantic Hockey announced the season would begin Nov. 13. Time for Hamblet and the Falcons to sharpen their skates.
 Bentley was two games into the postseason in March when "the virus ended everything," said Hamblet. "We were trying to win a championship for the seniors. It was sad to see them end their career that way. Really tough."
 Playing at the college level his freshman year was everything he'd wished it to be. "It was awesome," said Hamblet. Except for one thing. "I was coming off shoulder surgery and missed the first three games. It took me a couple of games to catch up to speed. But we had a great group of seniors. They didn't make me feel like a freshman."
 When teammates began incurring injuries, he began to get more ice time.
 His sophomore season was earmarked by "a lot of growth. I felt a lot more confident. I knew I could make plays with my stick."
 Playing center on a line with Johnathan Desbiens and Drew Callin, the Falcons went on a 12-game unbeaten streak.
 "Our line was gelling. We were having fun," Hamblet said. And he had tripled his point-scoring from his freshman season, 7 to 21. "Most of my goals were from the slot, the dirty area." His passes were crisp, setting up positive situations.
 He called his junior year "a replica of my sophomore year." Hamblet had a habit of picking on the service academies. His overtime goal beat Air Force and he lit the lamp in a 2-1 win over Army.
 While Hamblet was contemplating where to spend his high school years, Rivers coach Shawn McEachern got his first look at Hamblett playing in a tournament. Clearly the coach was impressed. "I was in eighth grade," said Hamblet. MacEachern gave him the sales pitch - "come take a look at Rivers" - and the kid bought it.
 "Those four years were right up there with the best years of my life," said Hamblet.
 Later MacEachern met up with ex-Boston University great and 17-year NHLer Tony Amonte, who was coaching the Cape Cod Whalers. MacEachern made a pitch for Hamblet, who wound up playing three years (16-18) for the Whalers, a roaming team. "We kinda played everywhere," Hamblet recalled.
 Hamblet has been at this hockey thing for a long time. "My dad (Scott) had played in high school. He put me on skates when I was 2-and-a-half."
 Post-Bentley, Hamblet hopes to stay attached to the ice life. "I would love to see how far I could go. I've heard good things about playing in Europe. Maybe a year or two there, then start a business career."
 That's the plan, and the dream.
 French connection
 It's no secret that Bentley's national reputation is a top choice for the college-bound seeking a business career. Emma Guccione was one of them. The Holliston High graduate is a senior corporate finance major at Bentley. But chances are students taking a minor like Guccione aren't sprawled all over campus.
 Guccione minored in French. In fact, you could say it was a destiny. Holliston has a French Immersion program inserted in its school system. "I took French from kindergarten to senior year," she pointed out. "I think Holliston is the only school that does that."
 Along the way, Guccione forged a soccer career, which continued at Bentley. "It's been tough (with the pandemic) but right now we're practicing four days a week wearing masks. It's hard to breathe when running. We're COVID tested every week by the trainers. We're taking all precautions. Without games, practices have been kinda relaxed. … It's been weird."
 Guccione began soccer in sixth grade and ran track too. "I was pretty passionate about both." At Holliston she was presented the Panthers' offensive MVP award in soccer. She ran track until senior year.
 As her college years approached, Guccione decided to stop track to concentrate on soccer. She liked the team aspect the sport offered. "You can't win a game by yourself," she reasoned.
 But you can boost the process, like the goal she potted in a memorable win over TVL champ Medway. "I remember that game vividly."
 At Bentley, Guccione lives off-campus with other athletes. To fill in down time "we do a lot of walking because we're on a computer so much." A good walk can ease the mind.
 Guccione has already landed a job with an accounting firm in Boston.
 All that French schooling has provided her with an ample mastery of the language, and she's put it to good use. She spent 2 ½ months studying at a French business school near Paris before the pandemic sent her home. She conversed with the locals. "But they could tell I wasn't born there by my accent."
 As far as her swan song at Bentley, "I'm crossing my fingers that we get to play a couple of games so our families can get closure."
 Either way, Guccione's Bentley years, as well as Hamblet's and Grabmeier's, will perpetually hold a special place in their hearts.

Wales' usual home at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff remains out of action after being used as a field hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 "It is no secret that more than three-quarters of the annual income which supports Welsh rugby at all levels comes directly from our international game and specifically from hosting Wales matches in front of capacity crowds," said WRU chief executive officer Steve Phillips in a statement.
 "That is why we made contingency plans to play matches in London and why we have waited as long as possible before resigning ourselves to the prospect of playing behind closed doors in Wales.
 "This news, however inevitable it may have become during recent days, is a financial set back, but it has not been unforeseen and measures have been and will be taken to mitigate for our losses," he added.

In 2017, Samsung announced a prototype of a stretchable display, able to be dented up to 12mm without causing damage. That display just bounces back to its original flat shape — similar to a trampoline — so it’s almost like the future is here. Besides stretchable displays, US researchers have also developed the first stretchable integrated circuit. Alternatively, phones of the future could be equipped by powerful lenses that project crisp moving images onto walls. This type of design would let you quickly increase the size of the device when watching videos, but still keep the phone's form factor enough to fit in your pocket.

Wales will play all three of their Autumn Nations Cup home games at Llanelli's Parc y Scarlets, the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) announced on Monday.
 Cardiff's Principality Stadium is currently unavailable after it was transformed into a field hospital amid the coronavirus pandemic and the WRU had contemplated moving the fixtures to a venue in London, with the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium under consideration if spectators had been allowed to be present.
 But with no prospect of fans being permitted back into major sports venues in Britain anytime soon, the WRU has decided to hold their matches, including a match against England on November 28, in the western town of Llanelli.
 Parc y Scarlets, the 15,000-capacity home of regional outfit the Scarlets, had already been announced as the venue for this Saturday's virus-delayed Six Nations match against Scotland and an Autumn Nations Cup game with Georgia on November 21.
 "It is no secret that more than three-quarters of the annual income which supports Welsh rugby at all levels comes directly from our international game, and specifically from hosting Wales matches in front of capacity crowds," said WRU chief executive Steve Phillips in a statement.
 "That is why we made contingency plans to play matches in London and why we have waited as long as possible before resigning ourselves to the prospect of playing behind closed doors in Wales."
 But, citing the "bigger picture" that meant public health concerns "must come first", Phillips added: "We know the nation will be tuning in and will be with us at Parc y Scarlets in spirit if not in person, and we look forward to the day when we will all be able to gather together once again in more familiar circumstances at Principality Stadium."
 Wales begin their Autumn Nations Cup campaign away to Ireland in Dublin on November 13.

PTI leader Abdul Latif through his lawyer Malik Ajmal Khan prayed to the court of Additional District and Sessions Judge Abdul Majid Khan that he (Abdul Latif) was leading the PTI in Chitral when the plaintiff Fauzai Bibi, who was a former MPA, had submitted nomination papers for the provincial assembly seat in the 2013 general election. He requested the court to allow him to become a party to the defamation case filed by the plaintiff so that he could inform the court about the facts. Meanwhile, the court adjourned the hearing of the case until October 29 after the lawyer representing the defendant (Prime Minister Imran Khan) sought more time to submit a reply on behalf of his client. It may be recalled that Fauzia Bibi, who was elected on a reserved seat for women on PTI’s ticket, filed a suit for recovery of damages to the tune of Rs500 million.
 She maintained that the defendant had made “baseless” allegations against her by accusing her of selling her vote in the Senate election. In June 2018, the defamation suit was filed under the Defamation Ordinance, 2002 against PTI chief Imran Khan, who later became the prime minister. The plaintiff claimed that she voted for the party candidate in the 2018 Senate election, but the defendant accused her of selling her vote, thus damaging her reputation.
 National Task Force suggested for lawyers welfare
 Senior lawyer Saleem Shah Hoti advocate, a candidate for the member KP Bar Council Peshawar seat, has said the formation of a National Task Force for the welfare of the legal fraternity is the need of the hour.

The candidate said he would try to ensure support to junior, old and financially disadvantaged lawyers as the legal profession is at a tipping point and the lawyers being an important pillar of administration of justice system shall be equipped with all resources and professionals in order to play their vital role in the judicial system. Hoti said that the Bar Council should be re- structured having a strong governing body and proactive leadership to promote the welfare of lawyers and ensure access to inexpensive justice, adding women and junior lawyers shall be given representation in the council.

Zemeckis ("The Polar Express,") sets his remake in a Jim Crow-era South. Most of the story plays out at a high-end resort for "rich white folks," the Grand Orleans Imperial Hotel, a place Grandma deems safe from threatening witches because the wicked ladies "only prey on the poor." The set-up is ripe for "Get Out"-style social commentary, but the script by Zemeckis, Kenya Barris ("black-ish") and Guillermo del Toro ("The Shape of Water"), doesn't go there. It's a missed opportunity for the kind of social satire Jordan Peele does best. Instead, we're left with another by-the-numbers kid flick featuring a cartoonish villain and three talking rodents, children who have been "mousefied" (others are "chickenfied"). It's all propped up by a game cast, including a pair of Oscar-winners in Hathaway ("Les Miserables") and Spencer ("The Help"). It also stars Stanley Tucci, Hathaway's "Devil Wear Prada" mate, as the hotel manager; Chris Rock and Kristen Chenowith do voice work; and Codie-Lei Eastick is the chubby English boy who befriends Jahzir's character, known simply as "Hero Boy."
 Most chills derive from suspenseful run-ins with the Grand High Witch. The showstopper unfolds in the hotel's ballroom, as the witches gather under the guise of a children's charity. While there, she reveals her true form: one- toe, three-fingers, bald and scarred head. She levitates and her flaring nostrils grow large, larger, largest; all the better to get you my pretty - oops, wrong witch. My bad. The big nose holes sniff out stinky children, who smell like poop to a witch, naturally. Hathaway, clearly having an over-the- top blast, won't make anyone forget Anjelica Huston's unnerving turn in the original film, which is on Netflix if you want to watch it before catching this one. Or, vice versa.

 Patrick Becker, interim director of Marion County's election board, said the county and state are seeing mail-in requests "that we’ve literally never seen before.”
 In fact, Marion County has had some difficulty delivering ballots to voters. Residents have reported not receiving requested ballots, and the county said it does not know where about 600 ballots have gone.
 In all, 933,681 Hoosiers had voted in the 2020 general election as of Friday.
