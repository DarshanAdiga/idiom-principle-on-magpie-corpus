At the close of Friday's formal trading session, WTI decreased by 38 cents to settle at $35.79. Domestic crude prices decreased in light of market concern about increasing coronavirus infections worldwide, which could lower crude demand. EIA's weekly report has also contributed to the decline in prices after it showed that total domestic crude inventories grew by 4.3 million bbl to 492.4 million bbl. If demand concerns continue this week, crude prices will likely decrease again.

It was earlier stated the ordinance doesn’t fit the Village, which lacks the administrative infrastructure to administer the process.

ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — The death toll in last week’s Aegean Sea earthquake rose to 116 on Wednesday as rescuers in the Turkish city of Izmir finished searching buildings that collapsed in the quake.All but two of the victims were killed in Izmir, Turkey’s third-largest city. Two teenagers died on the Greek island of Samos, which lies south of the epicenter of Friday’s earthquake. The U.S. Geological Survey registered the quake’s magnitude at 7.0, although other agencies recorded it as less severe.Mehmet Gulluoglu, head of Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, said search and rescue operations had been completed at 17 buildings that fell in Izmir. The rescue operation has been roaring at full tilt since Friday, pulling 107 survivors from the rubble.Of the 1,035 people injured in the quake, 137 remained hospitalized on Wednesday, the agency added. Following a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday evening, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pledged not to give up until the final person was recovered. Rescuers' spirits were raised Tuesday when they pulled a 3-year-old girl from the wreckage of her family home 91 hours after the quake.The tremors were felt across western Turkey, including in Istanbul, as well as in the Greek capital of Athens. Some 1,700 aftershocks followed, 45 of which were greater than 4.0 magnitude.In Izmir, the quake reduced buildings to rubble or saw floors pancake in on themselves. Authorities have detained nine people, including contractors, for questioning over the collapse of six of the buildings.Turkey has a mix of older buildings and new buildings make of cheap or illegal construction that do not withstand earthquakes well. Regulations have been tightened to strengthen or demolish older buildings, and urban renewal is underway in Turkish cities, but experts say it is not happening fast enough.The country sits on top of two major fault lines and earthquakes are frequent.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

When recruiting eagle agents, ensure they are congruent to the company’s culture. Look for goal-oriented producers who others will rally around.

 The members said that TANGEDCO should immediately stop issuing orders for private companies to maintain some sub-stations and HT lines in the State. “This unilateral decision of the CMD may affect the Corporation in the long run,” they said.
 At a time when the TANGEDCO had been serving three crore consumers across the State despite several limitations, it was unfair to give the upkeep of some sub-stations to private people. For a long time, the grievances to fill vacancies has also not been redressed, they charged.
 The government should direct the TANGEDCO management to involve the trade union representatives in all major decisions as any rift between them would affect the consumers, they apprehended.
 ## Dindigul
 In Dindigul, close to 800 employees staged a demonstration in front of the TANGEDCO office here at Meenakshi Naickenpatti. The members raised slogans against the management and urged that bonus should be given to all contract workers too. They wanted the vacancies numbering above 40,000 across the State to be filled as early as possible.
 The employees said that they would not remain mere spectators to the moves of TANGEDCO to privatise electricity distribution. For the last 63 years, the electricity department has been rendering yeomen services to the people of TN and despite limitations, they have been fulfilling the expectations of the customers.
 Under such circumstances, the TANGEDCO should immediately withdraw the move to give maintenance works of some sub-stations to the private sector, they stressed.
 A trade union representative said that all the employees and officers had taken a day’s casual leave on Wednesday to participate in the demonstration. As a result, many TANGEDCO offices in the district remained shut and routine activities were hit, he added.

Pernick told WHMI they’re very grateful to the voters for approving the proposal and ordinance, saying it’s been a long road to get here. He noted they had to go to the Michigan Court of Appeals twice to get the measure on the ballot and the court ruled twice in their favor. Even after that, Pernick says they felt there was a lot of misinformation about the proposal but glad voters saw through it. He said they were glad the voters chose to adopt the proposed ordinance and vote for the Village to start allowing cannabis and marijuana businesses and all of the economic development, revenue and jobs that come with it. From here, Pernick said it’s about swift implementation of the ordinance – noting it is pretty clear cut and lays out a timeline for businesses to apply for a license among other items. He said hopefully next year they’ll see businesses receiving provisional licenses to open up shop in Pinckney. Pernick said Pinckney is the first municipality in the entire county of Livingston to opt-in, which is a county of almost 200,000 people. He says that will allow important local access to help medical marijuana patients who won’t have to drive to Lansing, Ann Arbor or elsewhere for medicine. Pernick said he thinks the ordinance is pretty clear cut as it has already been argued in court and thinks it’s time to respect the will of the voters and the democratic process. He noted over 63% of voters supported legalizing marijuana in 2018 and there was now an almost 9-point margin in favor of approving the ordinance.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Control of the Senate is a razor-close proposition in Tuesday's election, as Republicans fight to retain their majority against a surge of Democratic candidates confronting the president's allies across a vast political map.
   
 Both parties see paths to victory, and the outcome might not be known on election night.
   
 From New England to the Deep South, the Midwest to the Mountain West, Republican senators are defending seats in states once considered long shots for Democrats. Washington's handling of the COVID-19 crisis, the economic fallout and the nation's uneasy mood are all on the ballot. Stunning amounts of cash have been flowing to Democrats from millions of Americans apparently voting with their pocketbooks; Republicans are tapping deep-pocketed donors to shore up GOP senators.
   
 President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden swooped in on key states important to the Senate as they propelled their own campaigns in a final stretch.
   
 Securing the Senate majority will be vital for the winner of the presidency. Senators confirm administration nominees, including the Cabinet, and can propel or stall the White House agenda. With Republicans now controlling the chamber, 53-47, three or four seats will determine party control, depending on who wins the presidency because the vice president can break a tie.
   
 "Let's run through the tape," said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, making a final campaign swing Monday in Kentucky as he faces Democratic former fighter pilot Amy McGrath.
   
 McConnell said he hoped to remain the Republican majority leader alongside Trump. But he acknowledged the tough Senate races could flip control to the Democrats. "Obviously, that depends on what happens," he said.
   
 The campaigns are competing across an expansive Senate map as Democrats put Republicans on defense deep into Trump country.
   
 What started as a lopsided election cycle with Republicans defending 23 Senate seats, compared with 12 for Democrats, quickly became a starker referendum on the president and his party.
   
 Some of the nation's most well-known senators are in the fights of their political lives.
   
 In South Carolina, Democrat Jaime Harrison is trying to topple GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of the president's top allies.
   
 The two crisscrossed the state in a rush of final campaigning, Graham acknowledging the tight contest after Harrison raised a whopping $100 million by October, an unheard-of sum for the state. The senator, making TV appeals for cash, said he, too, hit the $100 million mark over the weekend.
   
 Stuck in Washington to confirm Trump's Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett a week before Election Day, senators quickly fanned out -- some alongside the president -- for last-ditch tours, often socially distanced in the pandemic, to shore up votes.
   
 GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina joined Trump's rally in Fayetteville on Monday as he struggled to fend off Democrat Cal Cunningham despite the married challenger's sexting scandal with a public relations strategist.
   
 In one of the most-watched races in the nation, Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins made a final campaign stop in Aroostook County near her hometown, visiting workers in a sawmill. Democratic challenger Sara Gideon met voters at the Whistle Stop cafe for breakfast Monday.
   
 The Maine race is one of several that could push past Election Day if no candidate breaks the 50% threshold. Collins has typically rallied support as a centrist with an independent streak, but the tight contest shows the difficulty GOP senators have appealing to Trump's most ardent backers while also retaining support from more moderate voters.
   
 Democrats have more than one route to secure the three or four seats needed to capture the majority, and GOP strategists privately conceded the incumbents will almost certainly suffer defeats in some key races.
   
 Younger voters and more minorities are pushing some states toward Democrats. In Colorado, the parties have essentially stopped spending money for or against GOP Sen. Cory Gardner because it seems he is heading toward defeat by Democrat John Hickenlooper, a former governor.
   
 Arizona could see two Democratic senators for the first time since last century if former astronaut Mark Kelly maintains his advantage over GOP Sen. Martha McSally for the seat once held by the late Republican John McCain.
   
 Even the open seat in Kansas, which hasn't elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1932, is being contested.
   
 "The better President Trump does in a state, the easier it is to win any race," said Corry Bliss, a GOP strategist.
   
 The biggest risks to Democrats come in Alabama and Michigan.
   
 Republicans are expecting to reclaim the seat in Alabama, where Democratic Sen. Doug Jones pulled off a rare 2017 special election win in the Trump stronghold but now wages an uphill campaign against Republican Tommy Tuberville, a former Auburn football coach.
   
 In the presidential battleground of Michigan, Republicans have made an aggressive push for John James, a Black Republican businessman, as he rakes in cash to take on Democratic Sen. Gary Peters.
   
 "We think the numbers are moving," said Senate Leadership Fund president Steven Law.
   
 Still, voter turnout during the COVID-19 crisis remains key, and volatile, as more Americans than ever -- nearing 100 million -- cast early ballots.
   
 Both Biden and Trump touched down in Georgia, where the state is seeing a boost of new voters. Georgia's two Senate seats are at stake and could very well push to a Jan. 5 runoff if no candidate reaches beyond the 50% threshold.
   
 GOP Sen. David Perdue, the former business executive Trump calls his favorite senator, is working to fend off Democrat Jon Ossoff, another candidate who has benefited from the "green wave" of donations.
   
 Separately, GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler faces Republican Rep. Doug Collins, as well as Democrat Raphael Warnock, in a special election for the seat she was appointed to fill with the retirement of GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson.
   
 It's expected to be a long count in races across the country.
   
 The political landscape is quickly changing from six years ago, when most of these senators last faced voters. It's a reminder of how sharply the political climate has shifted in the Trump era.
   
 In Montana, Republican Sen. Steve Daines is trying to brush back Democrat Steve Bullock, the governor, in a state where Trump was popular. Democrats created an opening by working hard to recruit a well-known candidate in Bullock, who also ran in the party's primary for president.
   
 Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst is fighting for a second term against Democrat Theresa Greenfield. Texas Sen. John Cornyn faces an upstart Democrat, MJ Hegar, in the once solidly Republican state.
   
 And in Alaska, newcomer Al Gross, a doctor, has broken state fundraising records in part with viral campaign ads as he challenges GOP Sen. Dan Sullivan.

“When we are reminded of how impermanent we are, immediately we become humble and realize that we need each other,” says Tsabary.
 There are a couple ways to remind yourself of impermanence, according to Tsabary. First up: meditation. “Meditation is to understand that life is only lived in the present moment,” she says. “And when we embrace that, we embrace both impermanence and interconnectivity at the same time.” Check out these three easy guided meditations to help you get started.
 Second, Tsabary recommends connecting with nature—like, _really_ connecting with the world around you and understanding that we, as human beings, are of the environment. “We've gotten so far from understanding our intrinsic nature,” she explains. “We are no more, and no less, than the bacteria, the virus, the fungi, the deer, and the worm.”
 When you pare back your understanding to this basic level, you can become attune to the present moment and recognize that humans—just like every other animal on this Earth—are resilient enough to withstand whatever's thrown their way.

JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - A federal magistrate is ordering parties back to the negotiating table in a case that could determine whether the city of Jackson has enough money to fund repairs to its library buildings.Last November, the city filed suit against Zurich American Insurance for failure to pay out claims related to a 2013 hailstorm that damaged nearly two dozen city-owned buildings, including the Eudora Welty Library.In all, the city argues the storm caused nearly $13.5 million in damages. However, Zurich offered just $3.7 million in claims, including a $2 million initial payment, according to court documents.After being unable to get that payout increased, late last year the Lumumba administration filed suit in U.S. District Court seeking no less than $11.6 million in damages.The city and Zurich have been in talks for weeks. An initial “settlement conference” was slated for September 23 but rescheduled for October 30. However, court records say that by the end of October no settlement had been reached.Ball set another settlement conference for December 7, 2020, saying that “the parties should reconvene.”Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said some progress has been made during the talks but reiterated the fact that no agreement had been reached.“It’s encouraging that everybody is still at the table,” he said. “It’s a sign that communication is still going on.”Lumumba said the outcome of the suit could give the city the funds needed to repair buildings across the city, including the monies needed to repair or relocate the Welty Library.The branch is located 300 N. State St. and is the flagship branch of the Jackson- Hinds Library System.In 2017, the State Fire Marshal temporarily shut down the branch due to numerous violations brought about by the building’s structural problems.The building was opened days later, but with patrons being limited to the ground floor. Hours of operation were also reduced, per the state fire marshal.Problems at the downtown location stemmed from a 2013 hailstorm, which severely damaged the branch’s roof. Following that storm, a new roof was put on, for approximately $700,000. However, problems there persisted.In February of this year, Jackson Fire Marshal Elliott Holmes recommended that the building again be shuttered.At the board of trustees' meeting that month, Holmes said he conducted a walk-through of the Welty building, to discover that water damage there had weakened the structure of the facility.He said that on the third floor, damage could have incapacitated the fire alarm system, according to minutes from the February meeting.Welty has two main floors and a basement, which is home to the Hinds County Emergency Management Center.“(Holmes) stated that his opinion was that the library should not be open at all, especially in light of all the code violations he could site,” minutes read. “He did suggest that a sprinkler system would be preferred for putting out a fire, but his main concern was for the significantly damaged structure.”It was not known how much it would cost to repair the facility, or if the facility itself should be abandoned. In 2017, black mold at the downtown location did force the system to relocate its administrative offices, which had been on the top floor.According to court records, 161 city-owned properties were included on its policy with Zurich. The city paid the insurance provider $225,000 in premiums for coverage between August 15, 2012 and August 15, 2013. The hailstorm came through March 18, 2013.In its suit, Jackson is suing for breach of contract, breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing, bad faith refusal to honor obligations under its insurance contract and negligence and gross negligence.Zurich denies these claims.The city is seeking $11,577,753 in actual damages, further damages related to the insurance company’s failure to pay, punitive damages and legal fees.Copyright 2020 WLBT.

But there are pockets where if you look bottom up, some of the larger companies are doing quite well, says Chockalingam Narayanan, Head- Equities, BNP Paribas AM Is the US election another binary event that Indian investors should read in the papers or watch on TV and then move on with their lives as usual?It is definitely a landmark event but there are ground realities with regards to India. If you take a step back and look at what is happening with regards to the economy, you will notice that the developed world is going through a second wave of Covid. In India, we are seeing active cases recede but that is not to say that we may not see the second wave. But when we look at the high frequency indicators and activity levels, things are seeming to come back to normalcy. If you look at the composite indicators, things are definitely looking on the mend. Let Do you think whatever recovery we were anticipating, is already priced in with the Nifty at 11,800-11,900?The markets had a fairly stellar recovery from the bottom and in that sense yes. When we look at the trailing 12- month numbers and the earnings, we are indeed at a fair bit of premium but the trailing 12-month earnings are including a 68-day lockdown period. If one were to normalise it, our data suggests that we are at a 10- 15% premium in terms of PE multiples. But the cost of capital has also moved a bit down. But having taken all those things into consideration at a market level, the risk reward is slightly more skewed in favour of risk versus reward. But there are pockets where if you look bottom up, some of the larger companies are doing quite well. Not only large companies, good companies that are well run, large, mid and small as long as bottom up, are executing well. They are starting to do well. It is looking a lot more bottom up stock picking style, given that the markets at the headline level have seen reasonable recovery. Do you believe that many of the stocks that we have seen rallying significantly since March, may hit a valuation hurdle?In Q2, you would have witnessed a pattern where post good results, the stocks have kind of cooled off. So there is that adjustment slowly starting to happen. Only in a few stocks have we seen a big move post results. These are mostly in sectors or companies that did not participate in the rally. So, a differentiation is starting to play out and companies that have seen a stellar run as far as the stock prices are concerned, if they did not live up to the expectations, saw a bit of profit booking by the investors.

An Israeli study from 2011 looked at the relationship between democracy and stress hormones in the aftermath of elections, and found that the very act of voting increases cortisol in the body. Cortisol is a stress hormone which, if elevated in the long term, can lead to weight gain, diabetes, bone loss and metabolic disorders. This particular study only looked at cortisol levels at the ballot box, and not long term, so it’s impossible to say if heightened cortisol levels will be similar throughout.

Demanding the TANGEDCO chairman-cum-managing director (CMD)to hold talks with all the trade union representatives with regard to the vacancies and other issues, the employees and engineers from various associations came under a common umbrella to voice their just demands here on Wednesday.
 The Joint Action Committee of Electricity Employees and Engineers staged a demonstration in front of the District Collectorate. Labour Progressive Federation secretary V. C. Mohan presided. R Guruvel, state vice-president of CITU addressed the gathering. About 500 members including women employees and officers participated.
 The members said that TANGEDCO should immediately stop issuing orders for private companies to maintain some sub-stations and HT lines in the State. “This unilateral decision of the CMD may affect the Corporation in the long run,” they said.
 At a time when the TANGEDCO had been serving three crore consumers across the State despite several limitations, it was unfair to give the upkeep of some sub-stations to private people. For a long time, the grievances to fill vacancies has also not been redressed, they charged.
 The government should direct the TANGEDCO management to involve the trade union representatives in all major decisions as any rift between them would affect the consumers, they apprehended.
 ## Dindigul
 In Dindigul, close to 800 employees staged a demonstration in front of the TANGEDCO office here at Meenakshi Naickenpatti. The members raised slogans against the management and urged that bonus should be given to all contract workers too. They wanted the vacancies numbering above 40,000 across the State to be filled as early as possible.
 The employees said that they would not remain mere spectators to the moves of TANGEDCO to privatise electricity distribution. For the last 63 years, the electricity department has been rendering yeomen services to the people of TN and despite limitations, they have been fulfilling the expectations of the customers.
 Under such circumstances, the TANGEDCO should immediately withdraw the move to give maintenance works of some sub-stations to the private sector, they stressed.
 A trade union representative said that all the employees and officers had taken a day’s casual leave on Wednesday to participate in the demonstration. As a result, many TANGEDCO offices in the district remained shut and routine activities were hit, he added.

“In every moment, era, or crisis, we have a choice,” says Tsabary. “No matter how bad it is, how transformative this experience is, how shocking it is, we have a choice in how we navigate this.”
 What is this choice, you ask? Well, Tsabary explains you have the choice to walk down a “path of lack, scarcity, pessimism, and dishevelment,” or the path of “abundance, transformation, resilience, grit, and courage.” It sounds like a no-brainer, but Tsabary notes that you actually make this choice every single day, whether you know it or not. However, pre-crisis when life was perhaps easygoing, you were under the impression that you didn’t have to make this choice.
 “We go through our routines, and our organizations, and things fall into place,” Tsabary says. As a result, you may forget that you actually make this choice every single day, until a crisis practically smacks you in the face with it. “So any crisis—a divorce, job loss, financial dishevelment, health—wakes us up to this choice.” The question becomes: Which path are you going to take?

It allows patients with at least one of 22 debilitating medical conditions to use medical marijuana, under the approval of Mississippi licensed physicians and licensed treatment centers.More than 200,000 people across the state signed a petition to put Initiative 65 on the ballot.Initiative 65A restricts medical marijuana to terminally ill patients and would require pharmaceutical-grade marijuana products to have oversight by licensed physicians, nurses, and pharmacists.Proponents of Initiative 65A argue it was only placed on the ballot to confuse voters, as it was done without many steadfast guidelines on how to begin the process of legalization.Both initiatives included being written into the state’s constitution.Many major figures in Mississippi came out against Initiative 65, including Governor Tate Reeves and State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs.Dobbs says it’s the “Wild West” version of medical marijuana. His concern was the initiative making pot available in “pretty much every community.”Reeves argued “most non-stoners say we should be careful and deliberate,” and voted against both initiatives, citing a lack of local authority.Copyright 2020 WLBT.

Does your business have an online presence? If you do, here's how you can optimize the potential of your website to generate more organic traffic or increase sales. The world is rapidly transforming. Each decade brings with it innovations. And every aspect of life is influenced by these creations and inventions. In this decade, it is almost impossible to run a business without some form of technological intervention. So far, the Internet has revolutionized how we conduct business. Economic enzymes such as industrialization and globalization have fueled a necessity to expand scopes and access varying markets. A mainstream trend among shoppers of today hugely revolves around the digital arena. Almost all new-age shoppers base their purchasing decision on the information they gather online. People around you and social media also influence consumer behavior. But is having a website necessary? We'll take a look at the reasons why your business needs web pages. And if you already have an online platform, we will discuss how to make it more functional. How A Website Helps Your Business Generate more leads A website will help you expand your reach. The Internet is accessible around the globe, meaning that users can visit your site from wherever and whenever. However, to get the best of your website, consider implementing strategies that optimize your web pages, such as SEO. For instance, if you are in Australia, hiring a Sydney SEO agency like Australian Internet Advertising (AIA). SEO solutions involving both online and offline optimization will increase customer acquisition. And if you are using your website for e-commerce, the more traffic you attract, the better your conversion rate. The same applies if you plan to use your online platform to divert visitors to your brick and mortar store. Increased leads result in increased revenue. Increase overall sales What role does a website play to enhance a company's financial health? The answer lies in sales. When you generate higher revenue, you can expand and grow exponentially. As mentioned earlier, more than 80% of consumers first consult the Internet before buying any product or service. A viable website enables you to reach a larger audience. The more people interact with your virtual presence, the higher the chances to convert them to regular clients. But this is easier said than done. Thankfully, there are numerous technological innovations you can use to attract potentials, retain existing customers, and increase conversion rate potential. For instance, SEO is integral in improving your web pages. Depending on the agency you hire, they will ensure there is relevant content on your site to inform buyers. They analyze data obtained from running campaigns to keep track of the website's performance. The customer satisfaction rate will skyrocket. Your brand will get recognition and mentions in testimonials and on social media platforms. Consumer education sites will also give positive reviews. All the above is sure to inspire confidence in would-be shoppers. E-commerce is neither bound by the constraints of time or geography. You are available to any interested people at any time as you have no opening and closing schedule. A steady internet connection and a laptop are all they need. And with A. I (Artificial Intelligence) technology, you don't even have to interact with the shoppers one-on-one. Extra source of income There are multiple tools you can employ to monetize your web pages. You can run ads for non-competitor websites. This guarantees you do not divert business from yourself. Take say, if you are a real estate agent advertising property on your site, a housing insurance firm could approach you to market their services to a relevant audience. You are paid per click. Every time someone clicks on an affiliate link, you get a commission percentage. Helps grow your brand The more people you can get to visit your website, the faster your brand grows. Therefore, when you hire someone to design and develop your site, make sure they understand what you need. They also have to be knowledgeable and creative enough to execute your ideas. If your website is not user friendly, you risk losing valuable clientele. High-quality content that captivates the user will work wonders. And the best thing is if you lack the skill, you can outsource professional help to optimize your website's content. The SEO firm you hire will advise on the best procedures and strategies. Saves resources Running online marketing campaigns is somewhat cheaper compared to other traditional methods. You can reduce your ad spend by a sizable margin. Land-based businesses need to rent space to showcase their goods and services, which contributes to their overhead. Not to mention the staff they have to hire. Compared to a virtual company, they are likely to make a lesser profit. On the flip side, operating a website comes with cost-effective perks that allow you to realize the potential of your online business. For example, you don't need to employ customer service staff. With A.I. tech, you can converse with multiple clients on your site. You cut costs associated with payrolls and maintaining employees. Conclusion Each day numerous individuals or entities start a business. And the Internet has become an openly sourced solution for most people, which has turned the digital market into a ferocious beast. Having a well designed and functional website will up your sales and enhance your brand. However, go the extra mile and have your web pages optimized. It will help you reach your full potential in the digital landscape. Success only comes if your enterprise can think outside the box to stand apart from the competition. It is that edge that most consumers want in a brand. As more businesses discover the diverse advantages of having an online presence, so should you. Consider hiring an all-inclusive SEO agency to design a functional and properly maintained website. It is a sure way to get your brand out to attract more business, generate higher sales, and enhance productivity. A company's website plays an essential role in today's digital economy.

A memorandum of understanding to this effect was signed in Wolfsburg and Athen today by Konstantinos Fragogiannis, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs for Economic Diplomacy and Openness, and Dr. Herbert Diess, CEO of the Volkswagen Group. New mobility services such as vehicle sharing or ridesharing will help reduce and optimize traffic. Energy will be primarily generated from local green power sources such as solar and wind. The project initially will run for six years.

Jazz man Bruno Raberg said his music is limitless. "I really grew up with pop, rock and fusion," Raberg said. "I kind of got into jazz through fusion, like the Mahavishnu Orchestra and Weather Report, and kind of worked my way backwards. My roots are very much in pop music, Cream, Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin. In that way, I don't feel any boundaries in my music that it has to be jazz or something that might be played on a typical jazz radio station. Stylistically, I put out whatever I want, and hope people can find it and like it."
 Raberg has just released "The Prospector," the seventh album under his own name, on his own Orbis Music label, an intriguing collection of music recorded at his home studio in Lexington, with fellow Boston-area jazz players Allan Chase on saxophones, and Austin McMahon on drums.
 As a bassist and composer, Raberg has performed with a long list of musical giants, including Boston's George Garzone, Donny McCaslin, Bruce Barth, and Sam Rivers, since coming to the United States from his native Sweden in 1981. He's also a professor at Berklee College of Music in Boston, teaching in the school's Berklee Global Jazz Institute.

 Chase, an Auburndale resident, is also a prodigious composer and performer, who has played with Your Neighborhood Saxophone Quartet since 1981, and also worked on more than 50 albums. McMahon has a regular gig in Jerry Bergonzi's Quartet, and has also played with Garzone, Joe Lovano, Lionel Louke and Grace Kelly. But McMahon, who lives in Newton's Upper Falls, also writes music, and won the 9th annual Independent Music Awards trophy in the Jazz Song category.
 The new album, available on Spotify and through Bandcamp, has five of Raberg's compositions, two by McMahon, one from Chase, and two more that are credited to the threesome, since they were collective improvisations.
 However sophisticated the musical concepts underlying the individual tunes are, the predominant feeling they convey is infectious, melodic fun. Many music fans shy away from jazz, thinking it too complex, or not relatable, but Raberg and his trio have created music that is unique yet accessible.
 "I think a certain melodic sense is what I like to have in anything I put out," said Raberg, speaking from his Lexington home last weekend. "There may be complex lines, but that sort of melodic sense speaks to people. I tend to gravitate towards melody. That way you can have things be complex, all around the melody. When you can have rhythm, melody and harmony all working together, it allows you to bring in other aspects to make it fresh."
 Like most working musicians in America, Raberg and his cohorts have been sidelined by the pandemic. Even their teaching work has been transformed, since Berklee is still all remote learning, until January, when they hope to get back to some kind of hybrid model.
 "It's been an interesting experience," Raberg said of the remote teaching. "For my compositional course, it works very well. But for my work with ensembles, it is tough, because those are all about listening to each other. What we do is make multi-track recordings and bring them together that way, so the students learn studio skills too. And the goal is to make it sound like it's not overdubs."
 Raberg said he likes to have fun and try new things in his compositions. Consider "Rockside Haiku," a piece he wrote on a Gloucester beach, mimicking the Japanese poetic form, and creating a mysteriously entrancing mood. Or "Isometric Rotation," where he takes a simple motif and uses "two-part symmetric mirror inversions," or in other words, a main melody paired with a counter-melody that is the reverse; which comes across as a sizzling jazz foray. "Triloka" works off a pulsing beat, an exotic melody and invigorating shifts, based on a style from Southern India.
 "'Rockside Haiku' is something I did sitting next to a big rock," Raberg said. "I wrote the main melody there and tried a 5-7-5 phrasing model, like the haiku form. It's not exactly 5-7-5, but we elaborate off of that, see what happens and then get back to the main melody. That's a first take and I really like first takes a lot because they have a searching quality to them. Everyone has to listen carefully to what is going on around them and you get an energy that is really unique."
 There are more overdubbed multiple saxes on "Dissipating Clouds," a midtempo sizzler that has a theme that is a really infectious earworm. Raberg said he felt that one shows his fusion roots best of all.
 Drummer McMahon wrote "Lockleigh," inspired Henry James' "The Portrait of a Lady" novel, and it is a poignant, wistful ballad with exquisite tone, and a kind of Celtic aura. McMahon, who has an obvious literary bent, also contributed "L'Etranger," based on the Albert Camus novel, a lively if offbeat theme that is entrancingly romantic.
 "'Lockleigh' was maybe the most difficult track to do, but it is very melodic and works great on the album," said Raberg. "'Deimos and Phobos' (one of the improv numbers) is not as much a melodic piece, but serves as a contrast to those other ones."
 Raberg and his trio recorded the music long before the pandemic hit, but the down time allowed him to take the two days' worth of sessions and turn them into a cohesive album.
 "We three had worked in a quartet together, which put out a couple of albums," Raberg noted. "But this is a new configuration, and I asked Allan and Austin to bring in material. It wasn't a super-planned thing. But when I went back and listened to it, I began really liking it. I had Allan come in and do some overdubs and made some changes in the textures here and there, but mainly this is the result of those two days of sessions. "
 Raberg has more music "in the can" ready to release this winter. He has another trio record coming out with trumpeter Phil Grenadier and octogenarian drummer Nat Mugavero, focused on jazz standards, and also an album of solo bass.

And if we exclude his time in England, the 20-year-old has scored four league goals from six shots in the six-yard box, so the small sample implies he can be deadly there with the right service - a service that Everton may now be able to provide with their latest recruits this summer.
 Kean's second goal in Ligue 1 came from a counter attack, thanks mainly to the dribbling and generosity of Neymar, who squared the ball to Kean to leave him with a tap-in. Everton are not known for their attacking on the break – only seven teams took fewer counter attacking shots in the Premier League last season ( per WhoScored ). The Blues could definitely make better use of his pace and may just do when he returns next season.
 Kean can be handy from set pieces too, as he displayed in Istanbul last week. He opened the scoring by heading home an Mbappe corner, one of two goal attempts he had from dead ball situations that night.
 That’s half as many as he has had in total in the Premier League, illustrating how the Blues didn’t make the best use of him at set plays either, albeit two of his three shots in six yard boxes did come from corners last season.
 Ultimately it’s the overall quality of the team and the players within it which help to determine how successful a striker will be, and Kean is clearly at an advantage on that front in Paris. His goals should provide the Everton hierarchy with food for thought.

In addition, instead of using the Complex gymnasium, election officials opted for the cafeteria, a decision that V.I. Elections Supervisor Caroline Fawkes said needed to be revisited.
 “The gym would have been a better choice because we had to space out voters so much,” she said. “We could only take in six or so at a time [at the cafeteria].”
 Fawkes added that having five precincts in one voting center was a “reach” and would also have to be addressed.
 Lines were also seen at the D.C. Canegata Recreation Center and St. Dunstan’s Episcopal School but were not nearly as long as that of the Complex.
 No significant lines were seen at the Claude O. Markoe School in Frederiksted.
 Fawkes said elections officials were notified of the lines and deployed equipment to speed the process along.
 She called the hiccup a good “crawl before you walk” scenario that will allow election officials to prepare for the next gubernatorial election, in which more people are expected to vote.
 For some voters, the willingness of the electorate to endure a long line was a testament to how serious St. Croix residents felt about their community and their future.

The scourge of a global pandemic produced an election season like no other in the U.S., persuading record numbers of Americans to cast their ballots early, forcing states to make changes to long-established election procedures and leading to hundreds of lawsuits over how votes will be cast and which ballots will be counted.
   
 Polls began opening Tuesday as election officials warned that millions of absentee ballots could slow the tallies, perhaps for days, in some key battleground states and as President Donald Trump threatened legal action to prevent ballots from being counted after Election Day.
   
 Amid the tumult, tens of millions of Americans heeded warnings to act early, prompted by concerns over Postal Service delays and worries about the virus spreading through crowded polling places.
   
 "Come hell or high water," said Kristen Clarke, executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. "It feels like that has been the attitude voters have needed to make sure their voices are heard this year."
   
 At least 98.8 million people voted before Election Day, about 71 percent of the nearly 139 million ballots cast during the 2016 presidential election, according to data collected by The Associated Press. Given that a few states, including Texas, had already exceeded their total 2016 vote count, experts were predicting record turnout this year.
   
 Those yet to vote headed to polling places on Tuesday despite another spike in COVID-19 cases that has hit much of the country. Democrat Joe Biden's campaign had emphasized early voting due to the pandemic. Among those braving the polls were voters who may have wanted to vote by mail but waited too long to request a ballot or those who didn't receive their ballots in time.
   
 Others were likely persuaded by the president's rhetoric attacking mail voting or simply preferred to vote in person. With Democrats dominating the early vote, Republicans were expected to comprise a large share of Tuesday's voting.
   
 In the months leading up to Election Day, election officials had to deal with a pandemic that has infected more than 9 million Americans and killed more than 230,000, forcing them to make systemic changes largely on the fly and mostly without federal money. Meanwhile, Trump repeatedly sought to undermine the election with unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud.
   
 He has particularly targeted the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania, after the U.S. Supreme Court allowed -- at least for now -- a three-day extension for receiving and counting absentee ballots. Over the weekend, Trump said that as soon as the polls close there on Tuesday, "We're going in with our lawyers."
   
 Misinformation about election procedures, concerns about confrontations at the polls and reports of mail slowdowns also clouded the run-up to Election Day.
   
 "The eyes of the American public and the world are on election officials as we administer free and fair elections during this unprecedented time," said New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver, who also is president of the National Association of Secretaries of State. "Rest assured, we are ready. We have coordinated with all levels of government and are in constant communication to ensure a smooth election."
   
 The group has been working with the National Association of State Election Directors to help states hammer out plans for protecting against foreign and domestic cyberattacks, countering misinformation and strengthening an election infrastructure tested by massive early voting and pandemic precautions.
   
 Election officials across some 10,000 voting jurisdictions scrambled to purchase personal-protective equipment, find larger polling places, replace veteran poll workers who opted to sit out this year's election due to health concerns and add temporary workers to deal with the avalanche of mail ballots.
   
 Most states, even ones with broad mask mandates, stopped short of forcing voters to wear them at the polls. Instead, they urged voters to don masks while providing options for those who refused.
   
 "Ten thousand election officials, locals to every community in the country, have shifted on a dime and planned this election in record time and are working very hard to count every legitimate ballot," said Noah Praetz, a former election official in Illinois who has been helping election offices adapt their processes this year. "They are catching rare incidents of bad behavior, and they are ensuring the integrity of this election."
   
 Given the last-minute changes and decentralized nature of U.S. elections, problems were expected. In every election, equipment malfunctions, polling places open late and lines can get long, particularly in urban areas.
   
 On Tuesday, lines will be extended by social-distancing rules and could get worse if large numbers of voters who requested a mail ballot show up at the polls after deciding they would rather vote in person.
   
 In some states, those voters will be required to cast a provisional ballot -- one that ultimately will be counted if the voter is eligible and did not previously vote. But this also triggers a lengthier check-in process, leading to delays. Millions of absentee ballots were still outstanding as of Monday, including 1.3 million in Florida and 700,000 in Pennsylvania.
   
 Election officials have emphasized that while long lines are not acceptable, it does not mean there has been any sort of widespread failure. They also warned that isolated incidents of voter intimidation were possible given the level of political rancor this year, but that safeguards are in place and voters should not be concerned about casting a ballot in person.
   
 "There is a lot to be angry about and to fix after Election Day," said Wendy Weiser, director of the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice. "But despite those unprecedented strains, the system was able to pull it together and accommodate this incredible surge in voting. That required a lot of ingenuity, commitment to democracy and hard work, especially by our election officials."

Oggi lo Stato, che in 160 anni non ha risolto la questione meridionale e che non garantisce un’assistenza sanitaria decorosa ai cittadini calabresi, dichiara la Calabria “zona rossa”, nonostante sia la regione con meno contagi sia in valore numerico assoluto che in percentuale, solo e soltanto perché, rispetto a tutto il resto del Paese, in Calabria, lo stesso Stato non ha garantito, in quasi 75 di storia repubblicana, il servizio sanitario. Oggi si sancisce, purtroppo ed a malincuore, che la Calabria non è Italia, c’è l’Italia che ha l'alta velocità e c'è la Calabria che non ce l'ha, c'è l'Italia che compete con le potenze economiche internazionali e c'è la Calabria che è un'area depressa e con un'economia in continua recessione, c'è l'Italia che, anche in presenza di una pandemia gravissima, garantisce l'assistenza sanitaria e c'è una Calabria che non garantisce ricoveri, posti in terapia intensiva e subintensiva, assistenza domiciliare. I calabresi devono subire Livelli Essenziali di Assistenza indegni di un Paese civile, sono costretti all'emigrazione sanitaria per curarsi e la Regione Calabria è in piano di rientro e commissariata da oltre 10 anni, senza che il debito sanitario regionale si sia ridotto: oltre al danno la beffa, sacrifici senza la risoluzione del problema. Ci sono quindi due Italia, un centronord, evoluto, sviluppato e prospero, un centrosud più povero ed arretrato, ma con aree in via di sviluppo e poi c'è la Calabria, abbandonata dallo Stato, che sembra aver realizzato la piena arretratezza e l'impossibilità di sviluppo di un territorio, non più in arretrato di anni o decenni, ma di secoli, come tristemente narrava Primo Levi nel celeberrimo romanzo “Cristo si è fermato ad Eboli”. Già in campagna elettorale avevo individuato il problema principale della Calabria nella mancanza ed inadeguatezza dell'assistenza sanitaria. “In Calabria, dunque, o paghi per avere prestazioni private o scappi, e anche qui servono le possibilità economiche, o muori. I casi di malasanità balzano agli onori della cronaca giornalmente e noi non possiamo rimanere a guardare. Dobbiamo porre fine al commissariamento che ha portato a tutto questo”, questa è la parte finale del mio intervento in Senato in occasione della fiducia al primo governo Conte. Da allora nulla è cambiato anzi la situazione è peggiorata con il decreto Calabria che ha commissariato ulteriormente la sanità calabrese in base al pregiudizio mafioso ed al sospetto di infiltrazioni. Quasi 500 calabresi, assieme a me, hanno protestato a Piazza Montecitorio contro quel decreto Calabria che ha ulteriormente affossato le speranze di una terra di avere un minimo di dignità nelle cure sanitarie ed un’assistenza ospedaliera e territoriale da paese occidentale e non da paese sottosviluppato. Ha concluso così il senatore azzurro.

This has been compounded by his administration’s wholesale rollback of environmental protections and frequent undermining of scientific expertise. Climate is definitely on the ballot, and activists will no doubt be hoping for a Biden win.

Just like you would in an office, you should be taking breaks when you’re working from home. Set aside time each day for a lunch break. Although working through the whole day without a break might help you get work done faster initially, it’s not sustainable in the long run. By the end of the day, you’ll likely feel burned out, stressed and cranky. If you don’t give yourself the necessary time to unwind and refuel, your quality of work can suffer as well.

Trump's positions on other issues, some of which have drawn tremendous criticism, are less problematic for Israelis. For example, the idea of building a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border to stop illegal immigration is viewed in Israel as the sovereign right of a nation to prevent undesirable elements entering its territory. Israel has built walls and fences to stop the infiltration of terrorists and illegal immigrants. Sophisticated fences are exported by Israel's military industries. Israel has developed technology to enhance the effectiveness of such barriers.

 # Voters bring change to Onslow County Board of Education
 Jannette Pippin
 The Daily News
 Only one incumbent on the Onslow County Board of Education will return to office after a Republican sweep of the four open seats on the board, according to Election night results.
 Republican incumbent Ken Reddic was the top vote-getter, with newcomer Melissa Oakley following close behind.
 Reddic garnered 37,948 votes, 17.69% of ballots cast and Oakley received 37,696 votes, 17.57% of votes cast.
 “I’m honored the voters had the confidence in me to serve on the school board with the experience I thought was important to bring to the board,” Reddic said.
 Reddic said he looks forward to working with the current and new board members for the best for the students of Onslow County Schools.
 “I’m sure we can all work together to make the right decision for our school children,” Reddic said.
 Oakley said that as a parent with children in the schools she looks forward to bringing a new vision and a new voice to the board.
 “I am grateful the voters in the county gave me the opportunity to serve,” she said.
 Oakley said adding a new perspective with three new members on the board will be a positive change.
 “I think we share many of the same ideas,” she said. “I don’t think any of us will have a problem working together for the good of the children.”
 The other newcomers joining the board will be Republicans Joseph Speranza and Eric Whitfield.
 “I’m really excited and inspired to start serving the kids,” Speranza said.
 Whitfield has said in the past that he has plans beyond the Board of Education and released the following statement on Election Day.
 “My political planning started back in early 2003,” Whitfield wrote in the statement. “My vision goes beyond 2020. I am always thinking long term. None of my plans involve quitting. This is neither the beginning or the end. I love you Onslow County.”
 The change means a final term for current Chairwoman Pam Thomas and board members Earl Taylor and Paul Wiggins, who served as educators with Onslow County Schools before joining the school board.
 Thomas, Taylor and Wiggins, all unaffiliated candidates who had to petition to get the name on the ballot, chose to remain non-partisan in the now-partisan election.
 Thomas said she has enjoyed her time on the board and will provide whatever help she can to the newly-elected candidates.
 “I wish them the best of luck. Anyone who wants to be a public servant deserves to be supported,” Thomas said.
 Eight candidates were vying for the four open seats on the board.
 Democrat Takenya LaBriado received 20,908 votes, 9.75% of the ballots cast.
 As the unaffiliated candidates, Wiggins, Thomas and Taylor rounded out the remaining votes.
 Wiggins garnered 20,968 votes, 9.44% of votes cast. Thomas followed with 20,065 votes, 9.35% of votes cast and Taylor received 19,323 votes, or 9.01% of total votes.
 Results remain unofficial until the Nov. 13 canvass is completed.

A bill from Texas Democrat Lloyd Doggett, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee's Health Subcommittee, introduced during the last Congress with Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, would require hospitals to notify patients whether the hospitals — and the doctors and other providers that patients would see there — are in network. Hospitals would also have to tell patients how much they could expect to pay out of pocket. Without at least 24 hours' notice and the patient's consent — or if the patient was receiving same-day, emergency treatment — the hospital would be able to charge the patient no more than an in-network provider would.

The Pixel 4a brings 4.5 per cent more screen real estate its predecessor but has managed to do that in an overall small form factor. The screen isn't huge, but it is just big enough. There's a 5.8-inch full HD+ OLED screen which makes for a very solid panel. Even as it is not as sharp as the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra's sAMOLED screen, but it is bright enough for seamless usage outdoors and under direct sunlight. The OLED panel ensured that the contrasts were rich and blacks were deep. The viewing angles were excellent, and the colours were well-calibrated. The panel also supports HDR10 and has a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass 3 atop for protection from scratches. Google has fitted the Pixel 4a with a traditional and reliable rear-mounted fingerprint sensor which is any day better than the under-display fingerprint scanners. Also, alike previous-gen Pixel phones, the Pixel 4a's fingerprint scanner can be used to pull down the notification shade with a swipe of the finger.

UConn leads the all-time series 8-1, but the only loss was a lopsided 70-52 defeat last season in Columbia. UConn has won all three meetings in Storrs, along with the lone meeting in Hartford and the NCAA Tournament game in Albany, NY. South Carolina is 1-3 in Columbia.
 South Carolina has not announced any other games on its schedule. Staley said three weeks ago she expected the SEC schedule to be finalized within a week, but still nothing has been announced. At that time, Staley said she expects to play Temple and an unknown multi-team event. She was trying to keep the Clemson game on the schedule, but was not optimistic. She later said in an Instagram live that she expected to play NC State on December 3, a possible top ten game. After UConn and NC State, South Carolina can schedule five other non-conference games to schedule, plus the multi-team event. If South Carolina does not play a multi-team event, it can schedule seven more games.

SPIJKENISSE, Netherlands (AP) — The front carriage of a Dutch metro train that landed on a sculpture of a whale’s tail after plowing through the end of an elevated section of rails was painstakingly lifted clear of the artwork Tuesday and lowered to the ground.The train was left precariously balanced on the whale’s tail 33 feet above the ground Monday, after plunging off the end of a metro line in Spijkenisse, a town on the southern edge of Rotterdam. Two large yellow cranes worked in tandem Tuesday, placing chains around the front and rear of the train’s foremost carriage to support it. In an operation that started at dawn and lasted into the darkness of evening, workers also cut it loose from another carriage and removed its wheels before the train was lowered slowly to the ground.About 30 people watching the operation cheered as the front carriage finally was separated from the rest of the train amid gathering darkness and cheered again when it was deposited on the ground. The train was empty at the time it crashed onto the sculpture and the driver escaped unhurt, thanks to the whale tail’s unlikely catch.The local security authority said the driver was interviewed by police Monday as part of the investigation into the cause of the crash and allowed to go home.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Hernandez-Boussard says these results could lead to better pain management and reduce opioid prescriptions. "If the opioids aren't being activated and you're not getting appropriate pain management, you're going to take more opioids and you're going to take them for a longer period of time," she says. Apart from patients simply being in more pain than they need to be, this interaction "could lead to misuse or abuse down the road."
