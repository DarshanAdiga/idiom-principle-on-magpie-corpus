go argue with Coleman Hughes on Twitter. I'm not engaging. And this thread is by me for me to collect things I am interested in as to the what I believe is the current corruption of academia and those attempting to rectify that. Which I feel has little difference from the Marxists that overran and corrupted what was taught at UW Madison humanities when I was an undergrad there.I thought they were the bee's knees as an undergrad. I went on to be a proudly educated person and learned that ideological bias and propaganda, no matter how well meaning, is a killer of knowledge.

I'm pretty sure in the Bush or Reagan years you could get similar charts of official woke positions. Though gay marriage was largely the furthest frontier. Global warning didnt have serious effects yet. Plus war & overpopulation & poverty/starvation were still the overwhelming worries. 20 years of "war" in the Mideast hid that there wasn't that much war there, and even less elsewhere. Hypersensitivity to "security" Is one inherited feature of this much less dangerous landscape - on left and right. While we didnt actually "cure" our social ills - many just subsided with increased trade And relative prosperity and freedom of movement (sans the more totalitarian states), we've been left with the confused notion that we solve the big problems rather than put in infrastructure to hold back the worst.

Lionsgate has confirmed that John Wick 5 is in the works, and it'll be shot back-to-back with John Wick 4, which is scheduled to release May 27, 2022.
 As Deadline reports, the sequel was confirmed during an earnings call Thursday, with the studio's CEO John Feltheimer saying, "We're also busy preparing scripts for the next two installments of our John Wick action franchise, with John Wick 4 slated to hit theatres Memorial Day weekend 2022. We hope to shoot both John Wick 4 and 5 back-to-back when Keanu becomes available early next year."
 John Wick 4 was announced only days after the premiere of John Wick 3, and was originally slated for a Memorial Day 2021 release date. Of course, the indiscriminating coronavirus wreaked havoc on movie release dates and the fourth entry was pushed back a year.
 As we're still many moons away from seeing John Wick 4, there's no telling what to expect from its sequel. The good news is that we know John Wick 5 will start shooting next year alongside John Wick 4, so hopefully we won't be waiting too long between movies.
 The last we saw Keanu Reeves' titular hero, he was recovering from being shot by Winston (Ian McShane) and plummeting from a several-stories-high building rooftop. Now in the care of the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), John Wick is fired up and preparing to exact revenge on The High Table.

I have been wild about DiAngelo’s book since I read it last year because the associate professor of education at the University of Washington at Seattle is a white woman writing unflinchingly to white people about race. DiAngelo forces white people to see and understand how white supremacy permeates their lives and to recognize how they perpetuate it. More importantly, she shows them what they can do to change themselves and dismantle this pernicious system.
