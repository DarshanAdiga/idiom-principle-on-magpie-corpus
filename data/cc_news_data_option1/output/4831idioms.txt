With the primetime matchup of two longtime rivals wiped out, the Thanksgiving football tradition will come down to a less-than-scintillating doubleheader, at least on paper. The first game will see the Detroit Lions face the Houston Texans on CBS, and the second will feature the Dallas Cowboys and the Washington Football Team on Fox. All four teams have sub-.500 records, though the latter game's outcome will at least have some impact on the playoff picture because all the teams in the NFC East -- including Dallas and Washington -- have dismal records.

Many of the true freshmen don’t travel to away games. Kansas State coach Chris Klieman said part of the reason for their outbreak was because some of the younger players that don’t travel broke protocol.
 “I don’t know that you do know whether or not they’re following protocol,” Campbell said. “At the end of it, you hope they’re willing to stay the course. That’s why our sport is special. It’s a football team. Not a football individual. If you want to do anything, especially at a place like ours, it has to be everybody going to the same place at the same time.”
 Senior linebacker Jake Hummel has been just as impressed as Campbell has. Hummel’s younger brother Levi is a redshirt freshman who doesn’t travel so Jake might be a little more tuned into what the freshmen are doing during away games.

Paying for Your Baby's NICU Stay
 Health insurance helps pay for medical care. You may get health insurance from your employer, from the government or buy it on your own. If your insurance doesn't cover all the health care costs for your baby, ask the NICU social worker or case manager about your options. A social worker can assist you with finding resources and services to help care for your baby. You can also meet with the hospital's finance department about setting up a payment plan. A case manager may also oversee a baby's discharge from the hospital and help set up home care services and supplies, if needed.
 Learn more about the NICU and find articles and resources for your family at marchofdimes.org/NICU.
 Answers at Your Fingertips
 Having a newborn in the NICU can be overwhelming. You're likely to have lots of questions and need access to tools that help you through the NICU stay. You can learn about NICU staff, policies, equipment and terminology on your own schedule with the March of Dimes My NICU Baby App, which provide answers, tools and support so you can focus on your baby during what is often a difficult time.
 The app (available for iOS and Android devices) was developed to help parents cope with a baby's early birth, complications like birth defects and other issues that may lead to a NICU stay. It includes features like tracking breastfeeding sessions, breast pumping and kangaroo care time, taking photos and connecting with other families with similar experiences.

“This is supposed to be an 11 versus 11 and Jason will be included even though he will only get there at tea time on the first day,” Simmons told the media yesterday, during a Zoom meeting.
 Asked what he would like to see in their final warm-up fixture, Simmons said, “I think the same again as the three-day (game) with the batsmen getting big partnerships, the big scores and maybe a few more players getting scores and spending time in the middle is most important in this game.”
 “But at the end of the four days, the best thing that can happen is to win to go into the Test match with that kind of success and confidence behind us,” the West Indies coach added.
 “That is the most important thing for me and, as I said before, the bowlers continue to step up every time we go into a Test match. So I am not worried about the bowlers but I think we need some big scores from the batsmen, so I will be looking to see if that happens in this four-day game,” he noted.
 In the first warm-up match, Darren Bravo scored 135 while Shamarh Brroks hit 80, Roston Chase made 47 and Kraigg Brathwaite struck 47. The Windies bowlers grabbed just four wickets in the two innings but Simmons insisted that it is not one of his concerns at the moment.
 “I am not (concerned about the bowlers) because I think over the years, we have seen that the bowling has been our strength and if in these two matches the one that has gone and the one that is starting tomorrow, the batsmen can get into form and get into the line that we want them to, I am not worried about the bowlers. The bowlers always come up to task in the Test matches so far, for a few years now,” said Simmons.
 “Test-wise, ,after all the preparations and the guys have worked really hard especially during quarantine, it’s about using this four-day game now to just sharpen up themselves so that next week going into the first Test everyone is as sharp as they can be,” he assessed.
 Simmons said spending time in the middle is crucial and noted that he wasn’t too concerned about the runs but how the players handled themselves.
 “I think it is about spending time at the crease and I think the good thing about that training game we played was that Bravo, Kraigg Brathwaite, Brooks, Chase, they all spent time at the crease, so in this one it’s about spending time at the crease. And in that game, I wasn’t worried about the fact that Bravo scored a hundred. I look at the time they spent at the crease and how they controlled their innings and that is what I am looking for from John (Campbell) and (Jermaine) Blackwood in this four-day game,” said Simmons.
 “It is about understanding that you need to spend time out there to score the runs we need to get to 450 and 500, so I will be extremely happy if that happens,” he added.

Mr. Wayne was one of the best coaches I ever had. He was the one that encouraged me to go to my first pitching lesson ever! He is the main reason I started pitching and am still pitching today.
