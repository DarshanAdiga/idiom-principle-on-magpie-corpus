Kolkata, Jan 11 (IANS) A day after the Central government notified that the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) has come into effect, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday refused to recognise the notification, saying it would only remain a piece of paper.
 "We do not accept the notification of Government of India on CAA, which has come yesterday (Friday). We do not accept it. We do not accept NRC (National Register of Citizens) and NPR (National population Register) either. The CAA notification will remain on paper as people do not want it," she said at an indefinite sit-in organised by the Trinamool students' wing, Trinamool Chhatra Parishad, against CAA on Rani Rashmoni Avenue.

Ein Beschluss des UN-Sicherheitsrats gefährdet das Überleben vieler Menschen im Nordosten Syriens. Harsch kritisieren UN-Botschafter und Hilfsorganisationen das Gremium. Der Rat hatte sich am Wochenende darauf geeinigt, zwei von vier Grenzübergängen nach Syrien für Hilfslieferungen zu schließen. "Syrer werden sterben als Folge dieser Resolution", sagte die US- Botschafterin Kelly Craft zu dem Beschluss. Er sei "völlig unzulänglich für die Bedürfnisse des syrischen Volkes".

 Humanitäre Katastrophe in Syrien Idlib-Angriffe wirbeln neuen Flüchtlingsstrom auf
 Zunächst blockierte Russland im Sicherheitsrat wochenlang, dass überhaupt entschieden wurde, wie künftig Hilfsgüter die Notleidenden in syrischen Oppositionsgebieten erreichen. Bisher war es den UN durch eine Resolution des mächtigsten Gremiums der UN erlaubt, über vier Grenzübergänge Hilfe in Landesteile zu bringen, die Baschar al-Assads Regime nicht unter Kontrolle hat. Assad lehnt die Hilfe für Oppositionelle kategorisch ab. Daher ist die Resolution notwendig, um auch ohne seine Einwilligung die Grenze zu überschreiten und Hilfe in diese Regionen zu bringen.
 Die Resolution galt jedoch nur für ein Jahr und lief am Freitag aus. Russland - als Verbündeter Assads - wollte zukünftig statt der bisherigen vier nur noch zwei Übergänge offen halten. Moskau weigerte sich darum, die bestehende Resolution zu verlängern. Mit dem Kompromiss knickt der Rat vor der russischen Forderung ein. Zwei Übergänge - von Jordanien und vom Irak aus - werden für Hilfe dicht gemacht, zwei zwischen Syrien und der Türkei bleiben offen.
 ## 1,4 Millionen ohne medizinische Hilfe
 Vor allem der irakische Übergang nach Syrien Al Jarubija war jedoch entscheidend für die medizinische Versorgung der Menschen im Nordosten des Landes. "Morgen werden 1,4 Millionen Menschen im Nordosten Syriens aufwachen und nicht wissen, ob sie weiterhin medizinische Hilfe erhalten werden, die sie dringend brauchen", sagte Deutschlands UN-Botschafter Christoph Heusgen. Der Kompromiss sei zu einem "sehr hohen Preis" erreicht worden.
 Da die oppositionellen Regionen von Regierungsgebieten umgeben sind, haben Hilfslieferungen keine Alternative, um sie zu erreichen. Die Menschen sind davon abhängig, dass Hilfe über die Grenze zu ihnen kommt. Aus Sicht der deutschen Hilfsorganisation "Medico International" ist der Kompromiss "eine Katastrophe", sagte Nahost-Koodinator Till Küster. Für die 1,4 Millionen Notleidenden im Nordosten gebe es keinen Plan B.
 Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel hat die Notsituation am Samstag während ihres Treffens mit Präsident Wladimir Putin angesprochen. Sie hoffe, sagte sie später, "dass wir noch einen weiteren humanitären Übergang bekommen, in Richtung Nordosten Syriens - da gibt es auch Bereitschaft, Gespräche weiter zu führen".

As the Raiders (8-4, 3-1) held down the Menomonie offense, Hudson opened up the game on a 13-0 run before the Mustangs knocked down their first shot.
 "That’s what starts everything for us," Hudson coach Jessica Vadnais said of its defense. "Our goal is always to come out with intensity and that energy and really disrupt them early and get our confidence going as much of we can."
 Menomonie (4-9, 1-5) found a little rhythm halfway through the half cutting a onetime 19-3 deficit to 10 with six consecutive points, but Hudson came back with 11 of the 13 points to lead 30-11 at the break.
 "The main thing for us right now is just sticking together, coming through," Harmon said. "We played two good team here back-to-back — two long, physical teams. We don’t exactly match up well with that personnel wise right now."
 Menomonie played Hudson fairly evenly throughout much of the second half until the Mustangs went scoreless over the final 5:30. The Raiders closed the game on a 9-0 run.

 Liverpool are also looking to integrate Minamino into the squad, and signing a huge name like Dembele would surely be counterintuitive.

She wagged a gloved finger in my face and said, “You’re some boy.

The game got off to a slow and cautious start with both teams gauging each other. The first chance of the match fell for the visitors in the 14th minute when Amine Chermiti fed Modou Sougou down the right side of the box. But no Mumbai player could turn his dangerous ball across the box.
 Immediately at the other end, Nandhakumar Sekar's cross found Aridane Santana but the Spaniard's header went wide.
 Odisha continued to enjoy possession and threatened from wide areas. A corner in the 19th minute from Xisco sparked pandemonium in the Mumbai box, with Pratik Chaudhuri clearing the ball away after a bit of pinball in the box.
 Odisha kept peppering the Mumbai box with crosses and corners, but apart from several half-chances, they could not force an opening.
 There were a couple of close calls at both ends as the half wound down. Serge Kevyn's blocked shot fell for Sougou on the edge of the box. But his snapshot flew just wide in the 44th minute. At the other end, a blocked cross from Xisco fell for Nandhakumar inside the box. He worked some space for himself and pulled the trigger, but the shot went straight to Mumbai custodian Amrinder Singh.
 Odisha took a deserved lead three minutes into the second half after some brilliant work by Xisco. The Spaniard got past Mato Grgic and found Santana with a cutback from the byline. The striker was left with the simple job of turning it in at the far post.
 With confidence surging, Odisha kept troubling the Mumbai defence and Xisco and Santana both saw shots on goal blocked by desperate Mumbai defenders.
 In the 56th minute, Amrinder was forced to keep his side in the game after Santana sent Jerry Mawihmingthanga through on goal. The winger's shot was brilliantly kept out by the Mumbai custodian.
 In the 74th minute, Odisha made their dominance count with a second goal after Santana set up Xisco inside the box after winning a duel with Valpuia. Xisco made no mistake, smashing in a volley to make it 2-0.
 A crestfallen Mumbai outfit could not muster any sort of comeback as Odisha registered a hat-trick of triumphs at the Kalinga Stadium.
