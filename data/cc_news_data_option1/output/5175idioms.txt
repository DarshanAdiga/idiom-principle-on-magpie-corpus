Missouri concludes its quest for favorable bowl placement on Saturday afternoon at Mississippi State.
 The Tigers (5-4) were No. 25 in last week's College Football Playoff ranking before losing to Georgia 49-14. They will get one of the Southeastern Conference's bowl berths, but the outcome in Starkville, Miss., could determine which one.
 "We're going bowling," first-year Missouri coach Eliah Drinkwitz said. "We're excited about going bowling. It's an awesome opportunity for our team to get a chance to continue this journey together and play another game."
 Meanwhile the Bulldogs (2-7) battled adversity throughout a difficult year marked by COVID-19 complications. They fell 24-10 to Auburn last Saturday for their third consecutive loss.
 "In the end, together with all the commotion and clutter, we've created one of the most joyless seasons on Earth," first-year Bulldogs coach Mike Leach said. "And hopefully we have the presence of mind not to repeat it this way again."
 But Leach is hoping the Bulldogs can create a positive ending by beating Mizzou.
 "They're starting to play together better and better with the disruptions," he said. "I think (winning) would be huge. We've been on the threshold of that against some really good teams for the last several weeks."
 While Leach is open to filling one of the bowl vacancies -- sub-.500 teams are eligible this season -- Drinkwitz is emphatic about playing on.
 "We're going to be in a great game because of the type of season we had," Drinkwitz said. "Bowl games are still a reward for the season you had."
 Missouri is coping with injuries across its defensive front. Trajan Jeffcoat, Kobie Whiteside, Markell Utsey and Chris Turner are all questionable to play in this game.
 The depleted Tigers have struggled to stop the run in their last two games, allowing Arkansas to rush for 292 yards and Georgia to rush for 316. But they will face a passing blizzard with the Bulldogs operating Leach's familiar spread offense.
 "He's committed to throwing the football and does it at a really high level," Drinkwitz said. "They supplement their run scheme with tunnel screens, which helps them slow down the pass rush."
 Mississippi State quarterback Will Rogers has completed 71.1 percent of his passes this season for 1,533 yards and seven touchdowns. Jaden Walley emerged as his top receiving target with 43 catches for 562 yards, a school record for freshmen.
 "Their progression throughout the year, you can tell they are getting more comfortable in their scheme," Drinkwitz said of the Bulldogs. "They found their quarterback and he's doing an excellent job for them. He knows exactly where the ball is supposed to go. They have some dynamic wide receivers. You can just tell that offensively they are hitting their stride."
 The Tigers try to balance the power running of Larry Rountree III (851 yards, 12 touchdowns this season) with some pro-style passing with Connor Bazelak (2,141 yards and five touchdowns).
 "They're aggressive both sides of the ball," Leach said. "They have an aggressive run game on offense. Defense, they put a heavy front up there and like to play man coverage and try to be physical about it. It's not a situation where they're trying to fool you. They're pretty aggressive and right out there in your face."
 Mississippi State defensive end Marquiss Spencer will miss the game after suffering a scary head or neck injury against Auburn. He regained body movement at the hospital, but he remained under observation.

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang ended his five-match goal drought to help 10-man Arsenal avoid a record fifth consecutive home league loss in a 1-1 draw with high-flying Southampton. Captain Aubameyang started the process of atoning for his own goal in Sunday&rsquo;s miserable 1-0 home loss to Burnley, sweeping in a neat finish as Arsenal scrambled a Premier League point at the Emirates Stadium.Former Arsenal forward Theo Walcott had put the again- impressive Southampton into an early lead with a high-quality effort.The Gunners had Gabriel sent off for two bookings in four minutes – the first a pointless act of petulance in kicking away the ball.After Granit Xhaka&rsquo;s ill-disciplined dismissal in Sunday&rsquo;s Burnley loss, another red card was the last of boss Mikel Arteta&rsquo;s demands.A draw will hardly ease the pressure on manager Arteta however, with Arsenal&rsquo;s winless league run now stretching to six matches.Arteta had told his critics &ldquo;my chest is here, hit me&rdquo; in accepting Arsenal must &ldquo;take the bullets&rdquo; in the wake of their awful form.And those biting volleys will keep on coming now, with Arsenal still winless in the league since their 1-0 victory at Manchester United on November 1.Southampton manged to keep themselves in the league&rsquo;s top four however, with any frustrations over a draw just another sign of the burgeoning confidence under boss Ralph Hasenhuttl.Arsenal pressed with purpose and energy from the off, but were never able to generate any real rhythm on the ball.Home heads dropped heavily then when former Gunners favourite Walcott raced through and chipped home a delicate finish to put Saints into the deserved lead.Che Adams battled for the ball on halfway and slid in for a fine through-ball, that positively begged for Walcott to convert.The ex-Arsenal forward licked his lips, raced onto the ball and dinked over the helpless Leno.Then, for good measure, Walcott wheeled away and broke with player tradition – to celebrate against his old club.The Saints winger cantered off in delight before being mobbed by his impressed team- mates.Walcott&rsquo;s upbeat response was doubtless more to do with his sheer joy and relief to be on a run of fitness and form than any lingering frustrations at his Arsenal exit, back in 2018.The Gunners appeared wholly flummoxed by slipping behind, to compound their worrying recent run of form.Nicolas Pepe saw a rasping shot well blocked by Jan Bednarek, before Dani Ceballos had a spurious penalty claim dismissed by the officials.Bednarek deflected Saka&rsquo;s low cross goalwards as Arsenal found a foothold, but Alex McCarthy conjured a fine reaction stop.Arsenal&rsquo;s plight appeared bleak when trailing 1-0 at the break, but the home side came out refreshed and refocused – and quickly levelled.Saka cut in off the left and fed Eddie Nketiah and it was his fine reverse pass that opened the Saints defence.As the ball angled into the box, Aubameyang latched on, picked his spot and delivered.After his own goal against Burnley, here was the perfect response.Just when Arsenal thought they could plot a course for victory however, Gabriel felled Walcott for a second yellow card, to walk for his troubles.Just four minutes after kicking the ball away in a pointless act of petulance, here was another Arsenal red card that was both utterly avoidable and entirely unwanted.Arsenal brought on David Luiz for Nketiah and promptly sat back in a bid to protect their point.Saints went on the attack and replacement Nathan Redmond struck the bar with a first-time effort, having just reached Oriol Romeu&rsquo;s teasing ball.Redmond whipped just wide after another threatening Saints attack, before Moussa Djenepo had a tenuous penalty claim ignored.Arsenal could have snatched victory at the death, but Rob Holding&rsquo;s thumping header clattered the woodwork and bounced safe.

HAMDEN, Conn. (AP) — A Connecticut woman has been arrested after authorities found three dead animals in her home and seized more than two dozen cats along with dogs, squirrels and an owl, police said Wednesday.Hamden police said Donna Scirocco turned herself in Tuesday because of an arrest warrant charging her with six counts of animal cruelty. She posted a $5,000 bond and was ordered to appear in court Feb. 5.Animal control officials executed a search warrant at Scirocco’s home on Oct. 26 after neighbors complained about a stench and rats running around the neighborhood, police Capt. Ronald Smith said.Police said they found 26 cats, six dogs, two caged squirrels and a blind owl. There were also two large rats in the home, officials said. Authorities also found two dead cats and a dead woodchuck. Health officials condemned the property, Smith said.Hamden officials allege the animals were neglected and cruelly treated. All the animals were taken to veterinary hospitals for evaluation. A few of them had to be euthanized and the remainder are being kept at several animal shelters, Smith said.It was not immediately clear whether Scirocco, 59, has a lawyer who could respond to the allegations. Telephone listings for her are no longer in service.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

No. 22 North Carolina will face Kentucky on Saturday in the CBS Classic in Cleveland instead of No. 20 Ohio State. The announcement was made Wednesday as organizers looked to "more closely align COVID-19 testing protocols" between competing teams.
 "This a little unusual to say the least, but these are unusual times and that goes for college basketball, as well," UNC coach Roy Williams said in a statement. "Our team wants to play in the CBS Sports Classic. Instead of Ohio State, we'll play Kentucky. Perhaps it would have been better to make a change like this earlier, but the bottom line is we want to play. Kentucky, Ohio State and UCLA all have fantastic programs and we are excited about having the opportunity to play."
 This is the second Wednesday surprise for the Tar Heels, as last week N.C. Central replaced Elon on the schedule. The Heels (4-2) beat the Eagles last Saturday 73-67 in the Dean E. Smith Center.
 Carolina lost to Kentucky 80-72 in 2018 when the two teams last faced each other in the Classic.
 The Wildcats (1-4) have struggled this season with one of the youngest lineups in all of Division I. They have lost games to both of the ACC opponents - Georgia Tech (79-62) and Notre Dame (64-63) - on their schedule.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that it will keep buying government bonds until the economy makes “substantial” progress — a step intended to reassure financial markets and keep long-term borrowing rates low indefinitely. The Fed also reiterated after its latest policy meeting that expects keep its short-term benchmark interest rate near zero through at least 2023. The Fed has kept its key rate there since March, when it took a range of extraordinary steps to fight the pandemic recession by keeping credit flowing.In a series of economic projections Wednesday, though, Fed officials painted a brighter picture for next year, compared with its previous projections in September. The improvement likely reflects the expected impact of new coronavirus vaccines. The policymakers now foresee the economy contracting 2.4% this year, less than the 3.7% decline it envisioned in September. For next year, in anticipation of a rebound, the officials have upgraded their growth forecast from 4% to 4.2%. By the end of 2021, the Fed expects the unemployment rate to fall to 5% from the current 6.7% — lower than the 5.5% rate it had forecast in September.The Fed’s latest policy statement coincides with an economy that is stumbling and might even shrink over the winter as the raging pandemic forces new business restrictions and keeps many consumers at home. Weighing the bleak short-term outlook and the brighter long-term picture has complicated the Fed’s policymaking as it assesses how much more stimulus to pursue.At a news conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that challenge. While the economy and job market should rebound strongly in the second half of 2021, he said, “the issue is the next four to five months” as the virus keeps weakening growth.Powell also noted, as he often has before, that the pandemic recession has fallen most painfully on the most disadvantaged American households. “Economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future,” Powell said.With its benchmark rate already near zero, the Fed has turned to bond purchases, buying $80 billion of Treasury securities and $40 billion of mortgage-backed bonds a month. Those moves indirectly lower rates on mortgages, auto loans and credit cards, with the aim of encouraging more borrowing and spending. Before Wednesday, the Fed had given no guidance on how long it would buy Treasury and mortgage bonds. Saying it wants to await “substantial” economic progress suggested that the central bank envisions a lengthy time frame for those purchases.Powell and many other Fed officials have repeatedly urged Congress to approve more economic aid to carry the economy through what’s expected to be a financially painful winter, with cold weather foreclosing outdoor dining and rising virus cases discouraging many Americans from shopping in stores, going to gyms or traveling.Congressional leaders are considering a $748 billion relief package that would provide extended unemployment benefits, more loans for small businesses and possibly another round of stimulus checks for individual Americans. At his news conference, Powell applauded Congress’ belated move to enact another rescue aid plan.“This looks like a time where what is really needed is fiscal policy,” he said, “and it’s a very positive thing that we may finally be getting that.”Recent economic reports have generally reflected a sharply slowing recovery. On Wednesday, the Commerce Department reported the sharpest drop in retail sales in seven months. Americans held back on spending in November at the start of the holiday shopping season, which typically accounts for a quarter or more of retailers’ annual sales. Sales tumbled across the board — from clothing, electronic and furniture stores to department stores and restaurants. The only two bright spots were online and grocery store sales.The retail sales report was the latest evidence that the pandemic is slowing the U.S. economy as businesses grapple with tighter restrictions and millions of consumers stay away from stores. Last week, the number of people seeking unemployment aid rose for the third time in four weeks, evidence that companies are increasingly cutting jobs nine months since the erupted of the pandemic caused a deep recession. The Fed’s new guidance on bond purchases marks a shift from its previous statements, when it said it would simply keep buying bonds “over the coming months.” But providing a more specific timeline ensures that financial markets will not anticipate an earlier reduction in the purchases that could cause investors to push up rates earlier than the Fed wants. Longer-term rates reflect investor expectations for future borrowing costs. So reducing expected future rates keeps current rates lower. “It’s helpful to be as clear as you can be about your intentions,” said Bill English, a former Fed official who teaches finance at the Yale School of Management.Some economists had expected the Fed to announce a shift in its bond purchases by buying more longer-term bonds and fewer shorter-term securities — a step they could still take in future meetings. Such a move would seek to deliver more immediate help for consumers and businesses. Buying more 10-year Treasurys, for example, lowers their yield, and the 10-year yield influences mortgage rates and other borrowing costs. Yields on two- or three-year bonds, by contrast, don’t affect many other rates. But the Fed may prefer to keep that step in reserve in the event that the economy significantly worsens next year. Or it may also see it as a more effective move when the economy is reopening and people and businesses want to borrow more and expand. On Wednesday, Powell stressed that the Fed will consider all its options to strengthen growth.“We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy .. until the job is done,” he said. “No one should doubt that.”Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

 # Apalachicola oyster harvesting halted
 Jim Turner
 The News Service of Florida
 TALLAHASSEE — State wildlife officials said Wednesday they hope a full five years won’t be needed to restore conditions in Apalachicola Bay as they suspended wild-oyster harvesting in the bay.
 Members of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission approved the suspension as part of a $20 million restoration effort. The decision came despite pleas from officials in Panhandle communities to cut the time to three years to protect the local oyster brand and to carve out a western portion of the bay used by locals to gather oysters.
 “I understand why we are saying a five-year time horizon,” said Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission Vice Chairman Michael Sole, a vice president of environmental services at NextEra Energy, Inc. “I just think that should be the outside edge of our closure.”
 The suspension until Dec. 31, 2025, technically doesn’t go into place until Feb. 1. But commissioners on July 22 directed agency Executive Director Eric Sutton to issue the ban through executive order.
 Sutton said Wednesday the suspension could be shortened if efforts to improve the oyster population and revitalize the bay’s collapsed fishery can be done in less than five years.
 “We are going to be monitoring throughout,” Sutton said. “So if we achieve success sooner, and hit our target goals to allow for harvesting before five years, we certainly would be bringing that back. I promise you that would be the first thing on the agenda if that occurs.”
 Local officials continue to argue that state assistance is needed for the battered workforce in a region where families have spent generations harvesting oysters and in recent years have faced Hurricane Michael, home- destroying wildfires and the coronavirus pandemic.
 Franklin County Commission Chairman Ricky Jones said locals are “stressed” because the county has effectively become a single industry community — tourism — with seafood harvesting on hold. Jones also raised marketing concerns if the iconic Apalachicola oyster brand is removed from menus and shelves.
 “The longer it's off the market, that's going to be a market share that's gone,” Jones said. “I’m not sure what it would take to ever get it back once people find another source. That is kind of what our commission is really concerned about.”
 Patrick Farrell, a commissioner in neighboring Gulf County, requested that the Indian Pass area at the western end of the bay be removed from the suspension, as the shallow waterway is used mostly by people hand-picking oysters with their kids.
 “It's an ingrained part of the culture, to be able to harvest lagoon oysters,” Farrell said. “There's no commercial operation. These are families, people that have done it for generations and consider it their right.”
 Wayne Williams, a fourth-generation commercial fisherman from Franklin County, argued against the suspension, arguing the decline is not due to overharvesting and that the bay is already improving, with “oysters and grasses and algae beginning to grow again.”
 “We need to leave this bay open and bring jobs back to the area to help the economy,” Williams said.
 Money for the restoration effort is coming from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation’s Gulf Environmental Benefits Fund. That fund receives money from a settlement with BP and Transocean over the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster.
 The rule change to suspend oystering has been backed by the Pew Charitable Trusts, the American Sportfishing Association, the National Wildlife Federation, the Florida chapter of the Nature Conservancy and Apalachicola Riverkeeper.
 “We all want a thriving Apalachicola Bay abundant with healthy wild oysters, including oyster reefs that provide critical refuge feeding grounds and nursery habitat to many other ecologically important fish and invertebrate species and feeding habitat for shorebirds,” Apalachicola Riverkeeper Executive Director Georgia Ackerman said. “Suspending wild oyster harvesting for up to five years is an essential step in protecting and restoring the health and the productivity of the entire Apalachicola Bay. Certainly, we're all hopeful that this suspension will be shorter.”
 The bay, which once supplied more than 90 percent of Florida’s oysters, has been on life support for nearly a decade due to drought, overharvesting and, according to Florida officials, excessive water use by Georgia.
 The bay is at the southern end of the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint river system, which starts in northern Georgia. The U.S. Supreme Court indicated in October it will hear oral arguments in a long-running legal battle between Florida and Georgia about divvying up water in the system, but the court did not specify when.

After Granit Xhaka&rsquo;s ill-disciplined dismissal in Sunday&rsquo;s Burnley loss, another red card was the last of boss Mikel Arteta&rsquo;s demands.A draw will hardly ease the pressure on manager Arteta however, with Arsenal&rsquo;s winless league run now stretching to six matches.Arteta had told his critics &ldquo;my chest is here, hit me&rdquo; in accepting Arsenal must &ldquo;take the bullets&rdquo; in the wake of their awful form.And those biting volleys will keep on coming now, with Arsenal still winless in the league since their 1-0 victory at Manchester United on November 1.Southampton manged to keep themselves in the league&rsquo;s top four however, with any frustrations over a draw just another sign of the burgeoning confidence under boss Ralph Hasenhuttl.Arsenal pressed with purpose and energy from the off, but were never able to generate any real rhythm on the ball.Home heads dropped heavily then when former Gunners favourite Walcott raced through and chipped home a delicate finish to put Saints into the deserved lead.Che Adams battled for the ball on halfway and slid in for a fine through-ball, that positively begged for Walcott to convert.The ex-Arsenal forward licked his lips, raced onto the ball and dinked over the helpless Leno.Then, for good measure, Walcott wheeled away and broke with player tradition – to celebrate against his old club. The Saints winger cantered off in delight before being mobbed by his impressed team-mates.Walcott&rsquo;s upbeat response was doubtless more to do with his sheer joy and relief to be on a run of fitness and form than any lingering frustrations at his Arsenal exit, back in 2018.The Gunners appeared wholly flummoxed by slipping behind, to compound their worrying recent run of form.Nicolas Pepe saw a rasping shot well blocked by Jan Bednarek, before Dani Ceballos had a spurious penalty claim dismissed by the officials.Bednarek deflected Saka&rsquo;s low cross goalwards as Arsenal found a foothold, but Alex McCarthy conjured a fine reaction stop.Arsenal&rsquo;s plight appeared bleak when trailing 1-0 at the break, but the home side came out refreshed and refocused – and quickly levelled.Saka cut in off the left and fed Eddie Nketiah and it was his fine reverse pass that opened the Saints defence.As the ball angled into the box, Aubameyang latched on, picked his spot and delivered.After his own goal against Burnley, here was the perfect response.Just when Arsenal thought they could plot a course for victory however, Gabriel felled Walcott for a second yellow card, to walk for his troubles. Just four minutes after kicking the ball away in a pointless act of petulance, here was another Arsenal red card that was both utterly avoidable and entirely unwanted.Arsenal brought on David Luiz for Nketiah and promptly sat back in a bid to protect their point.Saints went on the attack and replacement Nathan Redmond struck the bar with a first-time effort, having just reached Oriol Romeu&rsquo;s teasing ball.Redmond whipped just wide after another threatening Saints attack, before Moussa Djenepo had a tenuous penalty claim ignored.Arsenal could have snatched victory at the death, but Rob Holding&rsquo;s thumping header clattered the woodwork and bounced safe.

Stuart Dallas, Ezgjan Alioski and Jack Harrison struck in the final quarter of an hour as Leeds leapfrogged opponents Newcastle in the Premier League table following an entertaining 5-2 victory. The visitors went ahead against the run of play midway through the first half through Jeff Hendrick, but goals either side of the interval from Patrick Bamford and Rodrigo turned the game on its head.Ciaran Clark levelled soon after Rodrigo&rsquo;s goal, but Dallas restored Leeds&rsquo; advantage, while swift counter-attacks led to Alioski and Harrison getting on the scoresheet – the latter finding the top corner from 25 yards.Leeds drew a line under back-to- back defeats – but their weaknesses at set-pieces were once again laid bare – while Newcastle were denied a third successive win for the first time since November 2018.This was the first top-flight meeting between the clubs since January 2004, while Leeds had not beaten their opponents at Elland Road since September 1999, but they were well worth the three points here.While they were unchanged from the side beaten by West Ham, Steve Bruce made four changes to a Newcastle side still without several players because of coronavirus – although Ryan Fraser made his first start since the start of last month.They made a purposeful start, with Isaac Hayden&rsquo;s cross-shot briefly panicking backpedalling Leeds goalkeeper Illan Meslier before settling on the roof of the net, but the hosts gradually got on top. Alioski and Harrison linked up well, leaving Jacob Murphy exposed down Newcastle&rsquo;s right-hand side, but a number of teasing crosses into the area were missing the final touch.Liam Cooper rose highest at the far post from a corner but Newcastle goalkeeper Karl Darlow dived to his left to save before Fraser served notice of the visitors&rsquo; intent, forcing Meslier to parry away a curling effort.Fraser then provided a cross which was flicked on by fellow summer signing Callum Wilson and turned in by Hendrick, another recent arrival at St James&rsquo; Park.Leeds responded well to conceding in the 25th minute with Rodrigo&rsquo;s ball into the area just evading Raphinha, whose powerful left-foot volley moments later through a crowd of bodies was instinctively pushed away by Darlow. But Leeds would not be denied. The influential Raphinha&rsquo;s cross was met by the equally impressive Rodrigo, whose header looped over a despairing Darlow and onto the crossbar, leaving Bamford with a simple finish in the 35th minute.Newcastle regrouped at the interval, although their appeals for a penalty fell on deaf ears, even though Cooper seemed to make no contact with the ball before bringing down Wilson with a crunching challenge from behind.The Magpies were becoming increasingly sloppy in possession, inviting pressure from Leeds, who went ahead for the first time in the 61st minute when Harrison&rsquo;s left-wing cross was met by a bullet header from Rodrigo.Darlow was helpless as the ball nestled in the far corner but the goal drew a reaction from Newcastle, with Wilson&rsquo;s strike forcing Meslier into a fingertip save, after which Leeds&rsquo; set-piece problems were exposed again.Fraser&rsquo;s corner to the back post saw Clark get above his marker to head beyond Meslier at the far post in the 65th minute – the eighth goal Leeds have conceded from set-pieces this season.But the seesaw nature of the game continued as Sean Longstaff was punished for dithering on the ball in the area. Mateusz Klich&rsquo;s ball from the left bounced over Jamal Lewis and was headed in at the back post by Dallas.Newcastle were then twice caught on the counter. First, Leeds burst upfield from a Newcastle corner and the composed Alioski finished well in the 85th minute.Another Newcastle corner led to Leeds charging upfield once again, with Harrison superbly finding the top corner with a left-foot effort from outside the area.

 “Bravo a Van Morrison por expresar lo que muchos sentimos. No más encierro… No más bozal. Después de más de 9 MESES de emergencia sanitaria y ‘cuarentena’, es obvio que la visión del grupo del miedo está equivocada. Simplemente, NO se ajusta a la realidad ”, escribió.
 Asimismo, Ricardo Salinas continuó con una serie de mensajes en los que critica el vivir con miedo al COVID-19 y aseguró nuevamente que 'el virus nos va a dar a todos', relatando sus experiencias familiares tras contagiarse y reafirmando que la pandemia tiene una letalidad baja, pese a los más de 100 mil muertos en territorio mexicano.

ATLANTA (CNN) - Delta is opening a “quarantine-free” travel corridor for flights from the U.S. to Amsterdam and Rome.However, to get on board, passengers first underwent abundant testing.Passengers headed to Amsterdam on Delta flight 76 began their journey about 5 days earlier. They took the first of several COVID-19 tests that enabled them to avoid quarantining when they arrived the following morning.A first test is followed by a rapid test at the Atlanta airport before boarding. If they are both negative, then the passengers are free to fly.The passengers take a third test upon arrival in Amsterdam, and only if that it is negative can they avoid quarantine.“It’s really the idea of stacking tests, or sequential testing, to try and capture any of those individuals that either falsely tested negative initially and/or converted in the 3-day period since they had their initial test perform. So, it’s just another layer of protection,” said Dr. Stefen Ammon, the emergency physician and medical director at DispatchHealth.Building COVID-19 corridors is part of the airline industry’s effort to restore confidence and revive air travel, by eliminating the need for time-consuming quarantine.“We’re hoping that in the first quarter of next year we’ll also be able to have more cities,” said Perry Cantarutti, senior vice president of alliances and international for Delta.There are similar corridors from Rome to New York, and soon Atlanta to Rome.Currently, the number of passengers on these flights is limited because of both EU and U.S. travel restrictions in place banning each other’s citizens from non-essential travel.Delta Airlines isn’t alone. All the major transatlantic carriers are experimenting with corridors of one sort or another, but their success depends on governments giving permission.All in all, these individual flights are a glimmer of hope at a new normal, a safer way of air travel in the coronavirus era.Copyright 2020 CNN Newsource.
