 The viral infection Covid-19 is ravaging the world, and had by Monday, March 30, 2020 killed about 34,000 people since it broke out last December. The illness caused by the novel coronavirus was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan in the central province of Hubei in December 2019.
 Initially, China was almost constantly in the news as the epicentre of the outbreak. Some 3,300 people died from the virus in China, where about 81,000 people were infected.
 From January up to early February, China was virtually the only country that was being associated with Covid-19, but fast-forward to March, and global attention on the outbreak in the world’s second largest economy seems like a distant memory.
 China has contained Covid-19 with stunning efficiency following the largest mobilisation in response to a health crisis the world has ever seen. An inter- agency task force mechanism consisting of over 30 government departments was established to coordinate a nation-wide response.
 Needless to say, attention is now focused elsewhere. In fact, the centre of attention is now Western Europe, in Italy to be precise, where the disease killed 10,800 people within just two months since the first case was reported. The death tolls in both Italy and Spain, where 6,800 people have died, have surpassed that in China by far.
 Even the United States with its much-vaunted healthcare network has not been spared, and the Trunp administration is now under fire for its poor and indifferent response to the outbreak, which has so far killed 2,400 people in the US..

The cancellation of the Books Along the Teche Literary Festival in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic also saw the cancellation of the popular Bourré tournament held at Pelican’s on the Bayou in conjunction with the festival.
 But tournament organizer Jerri Carlson LeClair said she hopes to see the tournament put on sometime later this year when the federal and state government give the okay to allow more than 10 people to gather for events. The tournament serves as a fundraiser for the Iberia Cultural Resources Association, which puts on the festival and such community activities as four free symphony performances annually in the city.
 “It’s one of the few things we can have independently,” she said. “The rest of the activities are pretty much festival activities. The Bourré tournament’s one of the most interesting and fun, but it really can be a stand-alone.”
 People enjoy the tournament, she said, and most of the work has already been done in preparation for it.
 “That’s why I think that it wouldn’t be anything (difficult) for us — it’s not like getting artists in from out of town, and all the other things that go with (the festival like) tour companies, the boats, the buses. It’s none of that, so we can very easily have an event,” she said. “And honestly, Pelican’s does this sort of thing all the time. They have an Easter thing for the kids, they have these community events, so this is really just nothing for them to be able to do it. Everyone’s always up for a good time.”
 LeClair said though she doesn’t play the game, she enjoys watching the competition.
 “There’s plenty of people who love to play, and it’s so fun,” she said. “I just can’t tell you how much fun these people have. It is a blast.”
 Even without the festival connection, LeClair said it shouldn’t be a problem getting the tournament going again. She said organizers want to be careful to give at least a couple of weeks time between the government allowing groups to gather again and the time a tournament would be put on, as an extra measure of safety.
 When it became clear that the tournament would have to be canceled, LeClair said she called all the prize donors and offered to return the prizes. All of the companies who donated prizes told her to keep them for when the tournament can be held, however.
 “All the prizes are in house,” she said. “We’ve got a bunch of great prizes.”
 And players don’t have to win to collect prizes. Each participant receives a ticket at the start of the tournament, and as the number of tables is whittled down, at each break prize tickets are drawn. There’s also a special prize for the first person to be eliminated (this year a bottle of Fireball Cinnamon Whisky donated by the Quarter Tavern).
 “We’ve been so successful, and we just kind of hung onto our profits from last year, it didn’t really take a lot to do this,” she said. “We knew when we had enough money we were going to do this.”
 The tournament fills up quickly, she said, with slots for 80 players of the trick-taking game, similar to spades, that is popular in Acadiana. The state Gaming Commission must provide a charity gaming license for the tournament, with the organizers filing for a specific date and time range, from 2-5 p.m. in the case of this tournament. The state also requires the tournament to provide “unique” chips for the event.
 In the past, that meant using poker chips either purchased, rented or borrowed with printed stickers pasted on each chip, then removed after the tournament. With some 8,000 chips, that proved time consuming and was not cheap, either. Though Carlson printed the stickers herself since they didn’t have to be high- quality, it still involved the cost of several ink cartridges and the paper itself. The group used fast-release stickers and several people would get together to place and later remove the stickers from chips.
 This year the group found it easier to order their own chips imprinted with the Books Along the Teche Literary Festival logo, which arrived just in time — for the tournament’s cancellation.
 Nevertheless, LeClair said she was excited to receive the chips, which she was in the process of sorting for whenever the tournament can be put on.
 “All in all this is really economical in the long run,” she said. “It fulfilled our gaming commission requirement that we have a special chip. I’m happy we have ’em.”
 About a two- or three-week window will be necessary to get things in order and put the tournament together, she said.
 “The only thing that’s holding us back is Pelican’s (not being able to seat customers) and the government,” she said. “Just as soon as we can find a good weekend, two or three weeks in advance that we can sell our tickets and file our session schedule, we would be good to go.”
 Entry fees were returned to the players, LeClair said, but she doesn’t anticipate any trouble getting the tournament filled.
 “I think this year it’s going to be sold out,” she said. “I guess because some people pay just to support it but might not come out (to play), we’ll have a waiting list. If somebody wants to come up and sign up that day, the tickets say if you’re not there five minutes till (the tournament), your seat might be given to somebody.”
 People ask throughout the year when the tournament is coming, she said, and she always tells them it’s the first Saturday in April (the Saturday of the literary festival). That, of course, had to change this year.
 “It’s just so popular,” she said. “A lot of politicians play. We kind of made a joke about it last year because we said, ‘Man, we should have protection’ because all of our politicians were under one roof. It was just a blast.”
 District 5 Parish Councilman Warren Gachassin plays a big role, she said, promoting the tournament, selling the tickets and collecting the money.
 “He is really the dynamic force that gets the players signed up,” she said. “He’s a great supporter.”

The square altar is nine feet square and five feet high and is constructed of aerated concrete. The material was ruled to be fit for use in the Temple. In the Talmud, it is explained that steel may not be used to cut the stones of the altar since the Temple Service brings life into the world and steel, as it is used in war, takes life. Stones for the altar may not be cut using steel since the Temple service brings life into the world and steel though not ideal, it is light and easily transported and sized to be loaded onto a truck. The altar was constructed on a metal frame designed also for purposes of transportability. The intent was to create an altar that could be taken to the Temple Mount at a moment’s notice should the need arise.

 Dar es Salaam. Plans are on for Mainland soccer giants Young Africans to bolster the team ahead of the 2020/21 Premier League season.
 According to sources within the club, they intend to release a number of players to pave the way for new signings.
 “Coach Luc Eymael has given us a list of the players he wants in the team to ensure that we are a force to reckon with come next season,” a source, who declined to be named, said.
 The source named former Yanga striker Heritier Makambo as among players who will feature for the Jangwani Street giants next year.
 “I can confirm that we are finalising plans to rope in Makambo for the 2020/21 season,” the source said.
 The Congolese forward parted ways with Yanga on August 10, last year to join the Horoya AC of Guinea.
