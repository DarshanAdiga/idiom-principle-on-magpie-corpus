Freeman says she is not surprised to see rashes come with COVID-19. Various skin manifestations commonly happen with viruses such as measles or chickenpox. But the COVID toes, which resemble a condition called Pernio or Chilblains, was unexpected.
 "Typically in the past, we haven't heard a lot about Pernio-like reactions in the feet in other viruses. It's not that it's never happened, but it's not a common viral reaction that we usually see," Freeman said.
 Pernio is usually an inflammatory reaction to cold temperatures and is seen in the winter or early spring.
 "What's unusual here is that we're seeing it in patients who are in warm climates or patients who have been sheltering in place inside in warmer environments," Freeman said.
 COVID toes are being seen in both children and adults.
 Freeman stresses that if these lesions appear on your toes, do not panic and go rushing to the emergency room. While some patients with COVID toes have gotten very ill with other symptoms, others have shown no symptoms other than the lesions.

DYERSBURG, Tenn. (WMC) - A Mid-South man is facing aggravated assault charges after coughing on officers. Investigators said the man claimed to have coronavirus.Dyersburg police responded to a trespassing complaint on April 28. Brandon McCaslin, 38, resisted arrest and coughed on the officers.McCaslin also told police he was infected with COVID-19. He purposely coughed on the officers and implied that he was attempting to infect them.McCaslin later told officers he was joking about having the virus, which led to the additional charge of filing a false police report.Police said McCaslin was served with an additional warrant for retaliation for past actions, following threats that he made against an officer. That charge stems from an incident on April 16, when police responded to an incident on Parr Avenue where a naked man was seen walking in the tree line near Lewis Creek.Officers identified the naked man as Brandon McCaslin. When police tried to approach McCaslin, he went down into the creek and did not come out.Due to McCaslin’s behavior and the hazardous conditions near the creek, police tried to negotiate his surrender. He was eventually arrested and charged with public intoxication.On April 17, McCaslin wanted to discuss his public intoxication arrest. During the discussion, McCaslin made several threats to harm one of the arresting officers - which resulted in the additional charge.McCaslin remains in jail. He has a court hearing on May 1.Copyright 2020 WMC. All rights reserved.

JEFFERSON CITY -- Much of the state won't "reopen" until Monday, but the Missouri legislature is already back in full swing.
   
 After more than a month of nothing but budget-related votes, lawmakers have largely returned to business as usual this week.
   
 Masks and social distancing are new, as is the lack of crowded hallways.
   
 But key Republican priorities, like asking voters to reverse changes they made to the redistricting process, are back in focus.
   
 Committees are combining dozens of bills into single pieces of legislation in hopes of passing many at once, just as they do near the end of every session.
   
 Some changes address the novel coronavirus pandemic, but many others don't.
   
 Here's a rundown of some of what they're working on.
   
 The Clean Missouri 'fix'
   
 Republican lawmakers have toiled for more than a year on a plan asking voters to reverse changes they made to the redistricting process that could cost conservatives seats in the next decade.
   
 They're not stopping now.
   
 The Senate has already approved the plan, and a House committee was set to take it up Thursday afternoon.
   
 At issue are major shifts the voter-approved amendment known as Clean Missouri made to how legislative districts are drawn.
   
 The first empowered a new, "nonpartisan" demographer to take the first crack at new maps, rather than the usual panels of political appointees.
   
 The half-Republican, half-Democratic panels will still review the maps, but they'll need seven of 10 votes to make edits to ensure changes have significant bipartisan appeal.
   
 The second changes the map drawers' priorities.
   
 In the past, they've focused on drawing compact shapes. But now, that takes a back seat to drawing districts that produce competitive races and better align the overall makeup of the legislature -- where Republicans hold supermajorities in both houses -- with the outcomes in statewide elections.
   
 That last part is key: those elections have been a lot closer than individual statehouse races in recent years.
   
 Republicans' plan, which some have dubbed "Cleaner Missouri," asks voters to restore much of the old system, nixing the new demographer and shifting concerns about competitive races and partisan balance to the back burner.
   
 Halting the Grain Belt Express
   
 Another top priority for Republicans, including House Speaker Elijah Haahr of Springfield, is reining in a renewable energy project called the Grain Belt Express.
   
 Chicago-based Invenergy wants to build a transmission line across northern Missouri to connect renewable wind energy from Kansas to customers here and in states farther east.
   
 Advocates for the project tout its potential to create hundreds of construction jobs and long-term savings for municipal utilities in more than three dozen cities, including Columbia.
   
 But Invenergy wants to clear the way using eminent domain, something Republican lawmakers, especially those in rural areas, say they can't abide.
   
 For years, they've called out the project as an attack on property rights and the agricultural industry, and in February, the House approved a plan to revoke the company's eminent domain power granted by the Public Service Commission for the second year in a row.
   
 The influential Missouri Farm Bureau applauded.
   
 "There's nothing more important to Missouri farmers than property rights," Bureau President Blake Hurst said. "Today the House of Representatives spoke up for the people of rural Missouri to rein in the abuse of eminent domain."
   
 Now, the legislation is tucked into multiple omnibus bills House members hope to send back to the Senate for passage.
   
 Pandemic absentee voting?
   
 Of course, some bills actually apply directly to the pandemic.
   
 Take one bill up for a hearing in a House committee Thursday with a line allowing anyone to vote absentee during a state of emergency this year to avoid the risk of getting or spreading the virus.
   
 For months, leading county clerks such as Greene County's Shane Schoeller and Boone County's Brianna Lennon have been calling for that and more, and it appears it may pay off.
   
 Currently, only people who have one of six specific excuses, like a religious belief or travel away from home on election day, can mail in or drop off a ballot early.
   
 "Confinement due to illness" is also an excuse, but it's been unclear whether that would apply to healthy people staying at home, and Schoeller has said clerks want something that covers everyone.
   
 Several other states, including those controlled by Republicans wary of expanding absentee voting, have already made similar tweaks.
   
 GOP-led Indiana, another state that usually requires specific excuses to vote absentee, is letting everyone do it in its June 2 primary, for example.
   
 And Haahr, Missouri's Republican House Speaker, has also gotten behind the measure.
   
 "I think everybody can say, 'Yes, if you're in a state of emergency, especially during a pandemic that manifests itself and spreads from person to person, we do not want you coming to the polls,'" Haahr said in a call with local business leaders Friday. "That is a very appropriate excuse for absentee voting."
   
 As for the rest of the kitchen sink ...
   
 Also on the table is almost everything else, it seems.
   
 Other COVID-related legislation under consideration includes a plan to shield health care providers from most lawsuits while they're rendering care or assistance in connection with the current pandemic in good faith. Exceptions would be made if the wrongdoing is deemed particularly egregious.
   
 Lawmakers are also thinking about creating a special committee to coordinate their response to the pandemic.
   
 And then there are the many other pieces of legislation tucked into omnibus bills, some of which run hundreds of pages long.
   
 Some have sparked controversy, like one that would exempt private schools from paying voter-approved minimum wage increases.
   
 Others attempt to address more technical issues, like a legal process for removing abandoned planes from airports.
   
 The legislative session ends May 15.

Donald Trump characteristically responded to the incident with a tweet last Wednesday: “I have instructed the United States Navy to shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats if they harass our ships at sea.” Although no context was provided, the president commands the armed forces and the tweet essentially defined the rules of engagement, meaning that it would be up to the ships’ commanders to determine whether or not they are being harassed. If so, the would be able to open fire and destroy the Iranian boats. Of course, there might be a physical problem in “shooting down” a gunboat that is in the water rather than in the air.

The only thing I’ll say in Harry’s favor is that it sounds like he still stayed “attached” to Map Action for a year after his five-year cycle ended just so he wouldn’t leave them all in the lurch. My guess is that the one year “extra” was his version of a graceful exit.

If the National Assembly decides to forge ahead, in a bid to amend our constitution, to allow diaspora voting, it is pertinent for it to specify what categories of people whose interest should be protected in our national elections, to avoid the tyranny of those who willingly left the shores of the country in search for better governance. For instance, individuals on foreign mission and military personnel who might be abroad for peace intervention in other parts of the world could be granted the constitutional leave to vote during general elections. This is necessary to stave off the conundrum that might result from people "voting with their foot" and still voting at the ballot. Clarifications like these are invaluable needs of our democratic experiment rather than populist responses that would create further intractable challenges in the long run.

Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday said that the lockdown in the state would be lifted gradually after May 3 when the second phase of the national lockdown ends. However, restrictions will not be lifted in Mumbai, its surrounding areas, in Pune and its surrounding areas as they fall under the red zone. Comparing the red zone areas to an active volcano, Thackeray said that lifting restrictions is "not in our interest".Thackeray addressed the state on Maharashtra Day via Facebook Live and said, "The red zone is like an active volcano, orange zone is like a dormant volcano, and the green zone is where the volcano will not erupt. Naturally, Mumbai, Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Pune, Pune Metropolitan Region, Nagpur and Aurangabad fall in the red zone as cases are increasing daily. Here, to start something is not in our interest. In orange zones, there are a few active cases in some areas; we are looking at lifting restrictions leaving aside areas where there are more cases. In the green zone, we have already started lifting restrictions gradually." He outlined that lifting of restriction will be done "cautiously".The chief minister added that farming and agriculture related activities were not under restrictions before and will continue to remain exempt in areas where restrictions may continue after May 3.Thackeray added that the lockdown had helped to keep the spread of coronavirus in control. He said that the "speed breakers" have helped contain the spread which would have grown exponentially had lockdown not been imposed. He said that though the numbers of cases are increasing in Maharashtra, they are increasing among the contacts and in a cluster. He said that 75% to 80% of the Covid-19 cases in the state do not show any symptoms or show mild symptoms of the disease. Outlining the work done by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, Thackeray said that in the past few days the civic body has screened 2 lakh people in the slums for low oxygen level and other diseases including diabetes, high blood pressure, etc. Such people are susceptibility to the coronavirus. "In Mumbai, 272 people have been found with low oxygen level and other ailments. BMC is not only providing oxygen but doctors are treating their other ailments," he said. Thackeray said that besides ramping up capacity of beds in the state, doctors and nursing staff have been inducted. He said he has received responses from 10,000 people including from doctors, nurses etc to volunteer in the fight against coronavirus.

SHANGHAI - China's central province of Hubei, where the novel coronavirus behind the pandemic was first detected, will lower its emergency response level from Saturday in the latest relaxation of lockdowns put in place to contain the virus.
 Hubei will lower the level from the highest to the second-highest from May 2, the province's health commission said in post on its public WeChat account Friday.
 Hubei is the last province to lower its provincial emergency response level, a major milestone in China's fight against the pandemic. The virus is believed to have originated in a wet market in the province's capital Wuhan in December.
 Hubei will also adjust prevention and control measures against the epidemic following the response level downgrade, the official Xinhua news agency quoted Yang Yunyan, vice governor of Hubei, as saying. The Xinhua report did not explain what adjustments would be made.
 Beijing on Thursday announced a similar easing of restrictions, saying it would mean removing 14-day quarantine requirements for people arriving from low-risk parts of the country, releasing those currently in quarantine and ending the requirement to wear masks outdoors.
 A health official said on April 26 that Wuhan had no remaining coronavirus cases in its hospitals, following a lockdown of the city and province that sealed roads, canceled trains and planes and left residents unable to move freely for more than two months.
 Hubei has reported no new coronavirus cases for 27 days as of the end of April 30.
 China's National Health Commission on Friday reported 12 new coronavirus cases in mainland China for the day earlier, including four domestically transmitted cases.

The political fallout from China’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic appears to be more severe in the United States and Europe than in Southeast Asia. Southeast Asian governments have avoided pointing fingers and instead shown solidarity with China in fighting the virus. Some, like the Cambodian government, have bent over backward to win Brownie points from China; Prime Minister Hun Sen visited China during the peak of the outbreak and declared that “the disease of Cambodian citizens is not a disease caused by the virus ‘corona’ but a disease of fear.” The Chinese government has thanked Southeast Asian countries and reciprocated with aid. Chinese narratives portray Southeast Asia as standing with China.

The current pandemic originated in China, and its government’s heavy-handed silencing of health care professionals and subsequent suppression of information led to its global spread. Taiwanese citizens seem to have taken that lesson to heart. A late February survey on national identity showed more than 83 percent of respondents identified purely as “Taiwanese,” as opposed to “Chinese” or “both Taiwanese and Chinese,” a record-high result over the past 30 years. Mainland officials have publicly accused Taiwan’s government of promoting an independence agenda during the pandemic. But if the results of the survey continue to hold true, Beijing will need to think twice before initiating another round of routine condemnation.

TALLAHASSEE — In a big win for Gov. Ron DeSantis’ administration and Republican groups, a federal appeals court Wednesday tossed out a ruling that said a decades-old Florida law about how candidates should be listed on the ballot is unconstitutional.          A panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Democratic voters and allied organizations did not have legal standing to challenge the law, which requires that candidates who are in the same party as the governor appear first on the ballot. Also, a majority of the appeals court found that the lawsuit improperly targeted Secretary of State Laurel Lee as the defendant.          The appeals court vacated the ruling by Chief U.S. District Judge Mark Walker and ordered that he dismiss the case. In November, Walker ruled that the state law was unconstitutional because it “imposes a discriminatory burden on plaintiffs’ voting rights.”

Wednesday’s majority opinion said Walker ordered “relief that the voters had no standing to seek.” It said, in part, that individual plaintiffs and organizations, including the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the progressive-advocacy group Priorities USA, did not prove that they were injured by the law.          “We hold that the voters and organizations lack standing to sue the secretary (of state),” said the majority opinion written by Judge William Pryor and joined fully by Judge Robert Luck. “None of them proved an injury in fact. And any injury they might suffer is neither fairly traceable to the secretary nor redressable by a judgment against her because she does not enforce the challenged law. Instead, the (elections) supervisors — — county officials independent of the secretary — are responsible for placing candidates on the ballot in the order the law prescribes.”          The crux of the lawsuit was that the ballot law benefits the governor’s party — Republicans for the past two decades — because it requires that the party’s candidates be listed first. Arguments centered on what is known as the “primacy effect,” which indicates that being listed first gives an advantage to candidates.          “By systematically awarding a statistically significant advantage to the candidates of the party in power, Florida’s ballot order scheme takes a side in partisan elections,” Walker wrote, adding that the U.S. Constitution does not allow “a state to put its thumb on the scale and award an electoral advantage to the party in power.”          DeSantis’ administration and national Republican groups, who joined the case as intervenors, appealed Walker’s decision, pointing to issues such as standing.          Wednesday’s majority opinion, which was partly joined by Judge Jill Pryor, focused on standing and whether Lee should be a defendant rather than the underlying arguments about how candidates should be listed on the ballot. William Pryor wrote a concurring opinion that raised questions about whether courts should delve into such disputes.

All is not doom and gloom. The newly awarded Basic Healthcare Provision Fund (BHCPF), a national program stipulated by the National Health Act 2014 already has funding approved by President Buhari - N55billion in 2018 and N44 billion in 2019. Like GAVI, BHCPF requires states to also contribute funding for primary health care, in conjunction with the Federal Government. The Basic healthcare Provision Fund is currently the lowest hanging fruit to strengthening our primary healthcare (PHC) systems. The herculean task of funding a health program has already been achieved. In our typical pattern, however, we seem to be stuck in implementation. The Basic Healthcare Provision Fund, called Huwe (an Ebira word meaning life) is already funded to provide free basic services to populations that need it the most. Before the program begins the primary healthcare must be renovated and made functional, complete with running water. Then medicines are purchased two months at a time and provided to each participating primary healthcare center. Based on the current program design there must be one functional PHC in every Ward in Nigeria. Today, Huwe is yet to fully take off. This implementation delay prompted a call to review the program's operational guidelines. The Operational Guidelines is the lynchpin of actualizing Huwe. The Ministry of Health has completed review of the program's Operational Guidelines which began in February 2020. The new guidelines must urgently be shared with stakeholders and the Huwe program must fulfil its intended objective. The time to implement is now.

"I hope you recover as quickly as possible."Other messages include "I pray the spread of the disease is contained as soon as possible" and "Let's join our hearts and get through this together."Pepper is not the only robot at work in the hotel in the Ryogoku area of Tokyo. A cleaning robot with the latest in Artifial Intelligence has been deployed to clean several parts of the hotel, including riskier "red zone" areas where staff access is limited.In an effort to reduce the burden on the medical system, Japan has secured more than 10,000 hotel rooms around the nation to put up patients with lighter symptoms, according to the Health Ministry.

Malta has announced a gradual lifting of coronavirus restrictions as the number of new cases dwindles, with many shops allowed to reopen from Monday. However, the government said people would have to wear masks in stores to prevent a resurgence of the disease."I am pleased we have managed to weather the storm without having succumbed to pressure to order a total lockdown," Prime Minister Robert Abela told a news conference on Friday. "The government is now starting a three-week programme to reopen most commercial activity."As of Monday, gatherings of up to four people will be allowed, with many shops and lottery offices also permitted to re-open. However, social distancing will have to be observed and changing rooms in clothes shops will be closed. Bars, restaurants and hairdressers must stay shuttered, the government said. The airport will remain closed at least until the end of May and schools will not reopen this academic year.Malta, the smallest country in the European Union, has reported about 450 COVID-19 cases and four deaths. Health Minister Chris Fearne said the closely watched virus reproduction rate had been below 1 for more than a fortnight. This means each person with the virus is passing it on to less than one other person, on average, which should eventually lead to the outbreak petering out.After the first case was registered on the Mediterranean island in March, Malta gradually shut down its ports, schools and all non-essential shops, while banning gatherings.

Justin Whidden, a husband, father of two children and a business owner, said he let his neighbors go to county meetings and “not to make a circus out of the situation but to go about it level-headed expecting there would be give and take from both sides.”          He said residents met a year ago in front of their homes with County Engineer Clinton Howerton Jr. and other county staff, and left with some relief and hope on having something more secure than a short field fence.          Whidden said he made calls afterward and had approximately half a dozen conversations with Howerton, directly. He said, based on those conversations, he believed that Howerton would work to upgrade Panther Parkway fencing at Lake Denton Road with leftover funds, if at all possible.          Howerton, when contacted Thursday, said that was one spot on the Parkway where residents had similar concerns, not the only one, but he said he looked into it and took it to the commission.          “I asked, but the commissioners said, ‘No,’” Howerton said..          A public statement from county officials that the project was under budget gave him hope, Whidden said, and he wasn’t as persistent on getting answers or updates, but knew he and his neighbors were willing to pay for the fence outright to ensure the safety of their homes and families.          “This is not something we felt we should have to do but rather something we would do,” Whidden said. “That was until we were told all maintenance and liability would fall on us homeowners given a different fence were installed.”          As of Wednesday, Whidden said, the road had an incomplete field fence with a large section of open handrail, where anything can pass through, including garbage from passing motorists.          “I try to pick it up myself but inevitably some of it will make it into and pollute Lake Denton,” Whidden said.          Whidden said the residents were told that they might be allowed to plant a hedge, at their cost, on their side of the fence. Howerton said he has sent residents an application packet for a permit to do just that.          Howerton said residents would then have to maintain the hedge.

The West Bengal government on Friday wrote to the Centre emphasising that there are four red zones in the state and not 10, as mentioned in the list presented during a video conference of the Cabinet Secretary with representatives of states. Principal secretary of the state health department Bibek Kumar in his letter to the secretary of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare termed the list "an erroneous assessment", and said Bengal, keeping in view the parameters set by the Centre, has earmarked four red zones -- Kolkata, Howrah, North 24 Parganas and Purba Medinipur.Kumar, in the letter, also enclosed a "correct classification of the state's districts and areas in the red, orange and green zones". Bengal currently has eight districts in the green zone and 11 in the orange zone, he said.The Union Health Ministry has listed 130 districts across the country in the red zone, 284 in orange zone and 319 in green zones, based on incidence of cases of COVID-19, doubling rate, the extent of testing and surveillance feedback. According to the ministry, West Bengal has 10 districts in the red zone -- Kolkata, Howrah, North 24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas, West Midnapore, East Midnapore, Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, Kalimpong and Malda.This classification of districts announced at a video conference chaired by the Cabinet Secretary on April 30 with the chief secretaries and health secretaries, will have to be followed by states and Union Territories for a week post May 3 for containment operations..

Mukeshwar Yadav, one of the hundreds of labourers who form the backbone of the daily operations in Azadpur Mandi, Asia's largest wholesale market of vegetables and fruits, hasn't seen his employer since the countrywide lockdown began on March 25. Hailing from Bihar's Darbhanga district, he has been living away from home for 10 years, but never felt so lonely. Sitting atop sacks of onions, covering his face with a cotton towel "to keep coronavirus at bay", Yadav says the government has "left people like him to die and rot here"."I have lived my last 10 years among these onion sacks. It did not feel haunting earlier, but now it does," he said, swatting a fly with his towel. Yadav, who used to earn around Rs 8,000 a month, has been living on the money he saved before the lockdown as income has dwindled with work drying up. "We have got vegetables here, but there is no rice, flour or oil... No one has come forward to help us," he laments.Across the street, three shops have been sealed by the administration after coronavirus cases were detected there. Between April 20 and 29, as many as 15 people in the mandi have been diagnosed with COVID-19, turning it into a hotspot. Earlier this month, a trader in the market died of the respiratory infection, spreading panic among the labourers.According to Azadpur Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) chairman Adil Ahmed Khan, 13 shops have so far been sealed and 43 people placed in quarantine. Surendra Yadav, 34, from Bihar’s Muzaffarpur district, says there has been very little work since the lockdown began. His earning has come down from Rs 300-400 daily to Rs 50 now. "Sometimes, even Rs 50 is hard to come by. Today seems to be one such day... nothing so far." Most of the porters have been living on their savings, he said and fears what if the savings get exhausted before the restrictions are eased.Surendra is surprised when told that the Delhi government is distributing free ration to migrant workers, the needy, elderly and homeless people. "No one has offered us help. We are on our own. Our employers have remained absent and no help has come from them," he said, rebutting all claims of aid by the marketing committee.Like hundreds of migrant labourers, these porters are stuck in the national capital amid this coronavirus-induced lockdown. With income drying up, they are desperate to return home. "I tried to go home but didn't get a ride, nor there was any bus for Bihar from Anand Vihar," Mukeshwar Yadav said, criticising the Nitish Kumar government for not taking care of its people like Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. Another porter, 40-year-old Anil Raj, interjects, "The UP government operated special buses to bring back their people stuck in Delhi and other states, Nitish babu is not so benevolent." Raj, who is also from Darbhanga, doesn't know the name of the disease or the virus. "I just know that you don't get an inkling of the disease… by the time you know it, you are dead." Raj's employer too hasn't been to the market for over 20 days. Asked if his employer has been quarantined, he stared blankly for a while and said he doesn't know what that means.Another porter, Madan (35) from Patna says his landlord in nearby Bharola area forced him out earlier this month because he could not pay the rent. Since then, he has been living in the mandi "among the mosquitoes", surviving on khichdi twice a day. Asked about his family in Bihar, he says, "I don't know what will become of us if I contract the disease. My kids, my wife and parents are waiting for me. I want to be with them when I die. I don't want to die alone." PTI GVS NSD

Expectations for China are clearly higher among Pakistan’s leaders and the public at large. Pakistan has appealed to Beijing directly for relief, both for debt repayment and for power purchases. The open question is whether Beijing is actually ready or willing to prove itself the hero and deliver a truly generous dose of aid that would enable Pakistanis to better weather the storm. This could overcome some of the frustrations that have brewed over the past five years and open the door to even deeper political, economic, and security cooperation in the future. Then again, as Washington has learned time and again (and Beijing may already begin to appreciate), Pakistan’s latest crisis is never its last.

ST. MARYS — A Rockton man is facing charges after he was allegedly caught driving under the influence of methamphetamine and amphetamines in March.          Nathanial Robert Hornung, 34, of Rockton, is charged with possession of a controlled substance, the use/possession of drug paraphernalia, driving under the influence of a controlled substance and driving with a suspended license, according to a criminal complaint filed at Magisterial District Judge Mark Jacob’s office April 14.          City of St. Marys Police were surveing 232 George St. March 29, due to ongoing reports of drug sales activity, when the officer viewed a white Chevrolet pull out of the driveway and travel toward Maurus Street. The officer followed the vehicle, running the registration plate and finding the driver, Hornung’s, license was suspended, according to the affidavit of probable cause.          Police initiated a traffic stop, discovering a man in the passenger’s seat as well, who said they were retrieving some of his items before he moved the following day. The officer said there were no items in the car, and noticed Hornung reportedly displaying signs of extreme nervousness. Hornung told the officer there were no drugs in the car, according to the affidavit of probable cause.          K9 Officer Nando was deployed on the vehicle, and gave indications of the presence of drugs, according to the affidavit of probable cause. Police reportedly seized a small glass vile of methamphetamine on the front passenger sea. Hornung, displaying spastic gestures and movements, performed poorly on the field sobriety test.          A blood test later showed Hornung reportedly had amphetamines and methamphetamine in his system.          Hornung’s preliminary hearing is set for 11 a.m. June 9 at Jacob’s office.

Signalling a big relief for lakhs of stranded migrant workers in different parts of the country, a special train carrying 1,200 of them from Telangana left for Hatia in Jharkhand after the Railways Ministry acceded to the request of the state government for facilitating their return. The first non-stop train left Lingampalli railway station here around 4.50 am, two days after the Union Home Ministry allowed inter-country movement of stranded migrant labourers, pilgrims and others and states like Telangana, Kerala, Punjab, Bihar and Punjab sought such specials.The migrant workers from neighbouring Sangareddy district, about 50 km from here, were brought to the city in buses and allowed to board the 24-coach train, the first passenger train to run in the country since the national lockdown to check coronavirus came into force on March 25, officials here said. However, they did not divulge any further details about the operation which was apparently carried out in a hush-hush manner and caught many by suprise.No formal announcement was made by the government on the operation of the train while district officials were not reachable despite repeated attempts. The railways described it as a "one-off" service while the state government was tight-lipped when asked if more such trains were in the offing.Some of the workers who boarded the special service were working at IIT, Hyderabad, located in Sangareddy, which witnessed protests by construction labourers, allegedly denied payment, who indulged in stone pelting and also demanded that they be sent back home. Three policemen including a sub-inspector were injured in stone pelting and a police vehicle damaged in the incident.Telangana government officials said due protocols for the safe journey of the workers have been followed. In New Delhi, Railway Protection Force (RPF) Director General Arun Kumar said the train left from Lingampally at 4.50 am. It's the only train to be deployed so far, he added."Today (Friday) morning a one-off special train was run from Lingampalli to Hatia on request of the state government of Telangana and as per the directions of ministry of railways," the railways said in a statement. All necessary precautions such as prior screening of passengers, maintaining social distancing at station and in the train were followed, it said.A spokesperson for the South Central Railway which is running the train service said all passengers were thermal screened at the station, masks were made mandatory and on board food arrangements made as the train will have no halts. As part of social distancing measures, it has allowed only 54 passengers per coach as against the capacity 72. In coupes, six passengers have been allowed instead of eight, the spokesperson said.The train will reach Hatia at 11 pm tonight and the migrants are expected to be taken to quarantine facilities. The railways clarified that this service was only a "one-off special train" and any further trains shall be planned only as per the directions of railways ministry and on request from both the originating and destination state governments.Meanwhile, a Telangana Minister, who had demanded for such a special train, claimed on Friday Union Minister of State for Home G Kishan Reddy had appreciated his idea. "Union Minister Kishan Reddy called me at 9.35 PM (on Thursday) and said the suggestionis good," Animal Husbandry Minister T Srinivas Yadav, who earlier sought special trains for migrant workers, said.He quoted Reddy as having told him that a committee comprising himself and others met and discussed the issue and felt the suggestion was based on reality..

“The voters and organizations’ complaint is based on the notion that Florida’s ballot statute, by virtue of the primacy effect, confers an unfair partisan advantage on the party that last won the governorship,” the concurring opinion said. “But courts cannot rely on legal standards to adjudicate this kind of complaint because it does not allege any burden on individual voting rights. Instead, adjudicating this kind of complaint would require courts to pick among various conceptions of a politically ‘fair’ ballot order that have no basis in the Constitution.”          The ballot order law dates to 1951, when Democrats dominated the state. But with Florida’s history of close statewide elections — — and Republicans firmly in control -- — Democrats launched the constitutional challenge in 2018.          In a statement issued after Wednesday’s ruling, Marc Elias, an attorney for the plaintiffs, pointed to a potential 5 percentage-point advantage associated with being listed first on the ballot.          ”While we disagree strongly with the court’s ruling that Democrats don’t have standing, it is important to note that the court did not dispute that Republicans are given an unfair advantage due to ballot order,” Elias said in the statement. “Arguing that Democrats are not harmed by an illegal and unwarranted 5% Republican advantage in every single election in the state is wrong, inconsistent with running a fair election, and we are considering all of our options in this case. We can assure you that we will take whatever steps are necessary to protect Florida voters this November.”          In a partial dissent Wednesday, Jill Pryor agreed with William Pryor and Luck, a former Florida Supreme Court justice, that the plaintiffs did not establish standing to challenge the law. But she said the majority opinion unnecessarily also ruled that Lee was not a proper defendant in the case.          Jill Pryor wrote that “principles of judicial restraint counsel us to refrain” from addressing the issues related to Lee’s role because the case could be decided on a lack of injury to the plaintiffs.          “I believe that the questions of Florida law we must resolve to decide traceability and redressability — in ordering candidates’ names on ballots, what role does the secretary of state play and does she exercise sufficient authority over county election supervisors? — are considerably harder than the majority makes them out to be,” Jill Pryor wrote. “I cannot agree with the majority’s decision to forge ahead nonetheless and reach alternative holdings that depend on resolving unsettled and difficult questions of state law about the scope of a state official’s role and the extent of her power.”          But the majority opinion said that any “injury from ballot order is not traceable to the secretary.”          “The problem for the (plaintiff) voters and organizations is that Florida law tasks the (county) supervisors, independently of the secretary, with printing the names of candidates on ballots in the order prescribed by the ballot statute,” the majority opinion said.

Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday said that the lockdown in the state would be lifted gradually after May 3 when the second phase of the national lockdown ends. However, restrictions will not be lifted in Mumbai, its surrounding areas, in Pune and its surrounding areas as they fall under the red zone. Comparing the red zone areas to an active volcano, Thackeray said that lifting restrictions is "not in our interest".
 Thackeray addressed the state on Maharashtra Day via Facebook Live and said, "The red zone is like an active volcano, orange zone is like a dormant volcano, and the green zone is where the volcano will not erupt. Naturally, Mumbai, Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Pune, Pune Metropolitan Region, Nagpur and Aurangabad fall in the red zone as cases are increasing daily. Here, to start something is not in our interest. In orange zones, there are a few active cases in some areas; we are looking at lifting restrictions leaving aside areas where there are more cases. In the green zone, we have already started lifting restrictions gradually." He outlined that lifting of restriction will be done "cautiously".
 The chief minister added that farming and agriculture related activities were not under restrictions before and will continue to remain exempt in areas where restrictions may continue after May 3.
 Thackeray added that the lockdown had helped to keep the spread of coronavirus in control. He said that the "speed breakers" have helped contain the spread which would have grown exponentially had lockdown not been imposed. He said that though the numbers of cases are increasing in Maharashtra, they are increasing among the contacts and in a cluster. He said that 75% to 80% of the Covid-19 cases in the state do not show any symptoms or show mild symptoms of the disease.
   
   
 Outlining the work done by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, Thackeray said that in the past few days the civic body has screened 2 lakh people in the slums for low oxygen level and other diseases including diabetes, high blood pressure, etc. Such people are susceptibility to the coronavirus.
 "In Mumbai, 272 people have been found with low oxygen level and other ailments. BMC is not only providing oxygen but doctors are treating their other ailments," he said. Thackeray said that besides ramping up capacity of beds in the state, doctors and nursing staff have been inducted. He said he has received responses from 10,000 people including from doctors, nurses etc to volunteer in the fight against coronavirus.

The Chinese Embassy and Chinese foundations and firms have made huge donations of medical supplies not only to hospitals and government agencies but also to various social and cultural groups of different ethnic backgrounds. Some have deemed the donations a public relations exercise to sway public opinion; some have expressed unease about Beijing’s discourse in projecting itself as a “protector” during this global crisis; while others have welcomed China’s concrete help with open arms. The finer aspects of China’s diplomacy have not been lost on Malaysian observers. The Chinese ambassador described China’s gifts as a reciprocal act, acknowledging Malaysia’s generous support when China was fighting the pandemic domestically. Meanwhile, China Global Television Network (CGTN) named Malaysian Health Director-General Noor Hisham Abdullah, the public face of Malaysia’s response to the pandemic, as one of the world’s top doctors in the fight against COVID-19, alongside the United States’ Anthony Fauci and New Zealand’s Ashley Bloomfield.

South Korean exports in April dropped at their sharpest rate since the 2009 global financial crisis, with shipments to all regions falling as the coronavirus pandemic crippled trade and caused an immense blow to demand for goods.

Not surprisingly, therefore, Asian countries such as Japan, Australia, and even Singapore have strengthened measures to control inward investment from China and prevent technology leaks from their economies and educational institutions—all in an effort to prevent excessive or threatening Chinese economic and technological dominance. Japan has even offered its companies a small but symbolic economic incentive to diversify production away from China. Nor is there any surprise that Beijing has recently managed to alienate Indonesia by its assertive actions in the Natuna Sea. China’s actions have even prompted the Philippines to officially and openly back Vietnam in its latest skirmish with China in the South China Sea. Asian countries have pursued their own pandemic assistance diplomacy to protect their ties to regional partners. Japan has been especially adept at regional outreach, garnering confidence from 61 percent of ASEAN survey respondents that it will “do the right thing to contribute to global peace, security, prosperity and governance.”
