Johnston & Williams Funeral Home and Crematory
 On Monday, October 19, 2020, after a long life well lived, Frank Beard rode into the sunset to meet his maker. Frank was born on January 23, 1928 to Wallace and Sarah (Woodworth) Beard on a horse buying trip to California. He is survived by sons Casey (Anne), Tim (Val) and Pat (Stephanie) and daughter Shannon (Don) Stewart, sisters Sarah and Helen, grandchildren, great- grandchildren and nieces and nephews. Preceding him death were his wife Charlot, son Kelly, his parents and sister Ruby.
 Raised in Toppenish, Washington, he loved horses from his earliest days. Even as a youngster, Frank excelled at buying, trading and breaking horses. Frank attended school in Toppenish where he was a gifted athlete and skilled boxer. Frank’s first job was riding horses for early World Champion bronc rider Lee Caldwell, who encouraged Frank’s desire to be a rodeo competitor.
 Following his passion, Frank competed in rodeos around the Pacific Northwest. He was an all-around talent in the saddle bronc, bareback and calf roping events, but enjoyed his greatest success as a bronc rider, winning several rodeos. To augment his rodeo winnings, Frank worked for noted stock contractor Johnny Van Belle at his ranch in Outlook, Washington. The job had benefits he hadn’t bargained for. When Van Belle’s daughter, Charlot, returned home on college semester break, the youngsters were smitten. After a whirlwind romance, they married on September 3, 1947. True to their rodeo roots, they honeymooned at the Moses Lake Rodeo, where Frank won the bronc riding.
 With a young and growing family, Frank cut back on rodeo competition, transitioning into a top-notch pickup man. He continued to trade and train horses and was a highly skilled farrier. Frank was also an accomplished packer, helping lead tours around Mount Rainier and the Wallowa Mountains during the summer and acting as a hunting guide during the fall.
 Frank shared his love of horses and extensive knowledge with anyone interested in learning. The Beard ranch was a community gathering place, filled with friends, family, and horses. Frank and Charlot were active in 4-H programs and their children’s school activities. Their home was always open to youngsters in need of a place to stay and a guiding hand.
 In the 1970’s, rodeo’s siren song drew Frank back to the arena. Supported by family and loyal friends, he founded Beard Rodeos. Frank earned a reputation for his award-winning livestock and honesty in dealing with rodeo committees and contestants. Supported by top rodeo riders, Beard Rodeos joined the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association in 1987. Frank’s stock excelled at Northwest rodeos including Ellensburg, Pendleton, Lewiston, Sisters and Hermiston. At the National Finals in Las Vegas, his bucking stock won many awards. Frank was intensely committed to making every rodeo as good as possible and had an unswerving sense of fair play. He helped many cowboys get their start and was always there to help a contestant in need. Cowboys enjoyed his passion for the sport, good natured kidding and horseplay, stories, one- armed pushup contests and pocketknife trades. In recognition of his outstanding contributions to the sport, Frank was inducted into several rodeo halls of fame.
 When failing health forced Frank off the rodeo road, he concentrated on amassing his prized collection of western memorabilia and Native American artifacts. He was always glad to show his collection to visitors. As the accumulated injuries of a hard, dangerous life and advancing years took their toll, Frank still found great joy reliving old stories and visiting with cowboy friends. He followed the sport until the very end.
 If a man’s wealth is measured by good friends, good horses, a good name and a loving family, Frank Beard was a rich man.
 A private family graveside service has been held and a celebration of life for Frank and Charot will be held when it is safe to do so. Memorial contributions in Frank's honor are suggested to the Justin Cowboy Crisis Fund, 101 Pro Rodeo Drive, Colorado Springs, CO 80919 or online at www.justincowboycrisisfund.org.
 Johnston & Williams Funeral Home and Crematory of Ellensburg has been entrusted with caring for Frank's family. Online condolences may be left at www.johnston-williams.com.

Halloween, more than almost any other holiday, is about fun. It's like New Year's, but with corn syrup instead of booze.      It began with the Gaelic festival Samhain, which celebrated the end of harvest while ushering in the dark half of the year, a spooky time when the boundaries between the living and spirit worlds were thought to become more porous. Brought to America by Irish and Scottish settlers, Halloween found footholds in the southern colonies, and developed a more playful, mischievous, and decidedly corny vibe.      Candy corn didn't start out as a Halloween treat but jumped on the bandwagon in the 1950s, as Halloween pivoted into a full embrace of processed sugar.      Corn officially became spooky with the release of "Children of the Corn," a 1984 movie about a Midwestern village where the kids took over and decided nobody was permitted to age beyond 17. In 1993, the world's first for-profit corn maze was built in Annville, Pennsylvania. Since then the tradition has taken off, and corn mazes now number in the thousands.      When I lived in New Mexico I learned about chicos, a type of Native American dried corn. "Chicos" means "little boys" in Spanish, as the kernels shrink when dried. The ones for sale at the store were dried to the hardness of popcorn, but when I make them at home I let them stay a bit chewy, like real- life versions of candy corn. Each batch of chicos has a unique character, with different levels of brown, crunchiness, chewiness and/or sweetness, depending on the corn and how long it's roasted.      Many Halloween corn mazes are closed this year, thanks to COVID-19. And door- to-door candy-begging is largely out, too. If treat-seekers are left to their own devices I'm fine with that, because processed sugar is poison, and a tradition that hinges on giving candy to kids isn't worth rescuing.      So allow me to tell you how I make chicos. I made about three dozen ears' worth, which won't last too long but is a nice stash. I will follow my chicos tips with a few recipes, one sweet and one savory, for how I used them.      Chicos   The only ingredient is corn, preferably with the husk on. Traditionally, the process involves a clay oven or "horno," but other ovens work, too. Ultimately, you're doing little more than drying out corn.      Although usually made with fresh corn, I've also made chicos with frozen corn, and the operation was surprisingly successful, even if the product lacked the soulful smokey flavor that a roasted corn husk imparts.      Turn the oven to 300 F and place the ears directly on the oven racks, not touching one another, and bake until the husks start to dry out and brown and even smoke a little, about three hours. When cool, peel off the husks. If using husked or frozen corn, skip this step.      Turn oven down to 225. Put the cobs on the oven racks, spaced so as not to touch one another, and bake until the kernels start to shrink and visibly dry out, about four hours. Let the ears cool completely, and rub off the kernels -- use the edge of a spoon if they are stubborn. Store in a plastic bag in a cool, dry place. The drier you get them, the longer they will store.      If making chicos from frozen corn, spread the kernels on a cookie sheet and bake at 225. They will take less time -- about two hours -- and will quickly turn brown and then black.      Chicos and Milk   Fill a bowl with chicos and milk, with sugar to taste. When the chicos are gone and you sip the sweet milk that remains, you may feel a distinct deja vu to a time, long ago, when you sipped the sweet leftover milk from a bowl of corn flakes or Frosted Flakes.      Beans with Chicos   A handful of chicos turns a pot of beans into something interesting and delightful. Served alongside rice, you've got a delicious meal with complete protein.   Serves 2   • 1 strip bacon (optional, recommended), chopped   • 1 tablespoon olive oil if skipping the bacon or if it's lean   • ½ cup minced onions   • 1 clove garlic, minced   • 1 teaspoon minced fresh oregano or thyme   • ¼ cup chicos   • 1 can plain beans (pinto, white, black, kidney) including the liquid   • 1 can water or stock   • 1 teaspoon paprika or chile powder to taste   • Salt, if the bacon doesn't add enough   Fry the bacon on medium heat. When half-crispy, about five minutes, add the onions, garlic and herbs. Fry until the onions become translucent. Add the chicos, beans, water and paprika, and stir together. Season with salt, if necessary. Heat to a simmer, stirring as necessary to prevent sticking. Adjust seasoning and serve.

Tallassee (2-7, 2-4) could not clean up the turnovers as the night went on as the Tigers threw four interceptions, three from quarterback Tyler Ellis and one from Marciano Smith on a trick play.
 The Tigers finished with just 66 yards of total offense while Clay Central racked up 399. Ellis completed 8-of-16 pass attempts for 19 yards while one of the region’s top rushers Jalyn Daniels was limited to just 24 yards on 13 carries.
 Tallassee’s defense helped keep the visitors in the game on with a couple of takeaways of its own. Clayten Gough had an interception on Clay Central’s opening drive while Smith recovered a fumble early in the fourth quarter.
 After Smith’s takeaway, Tallassee got into its best field position of the night but an interception from Clay Central’s Davion Thomas inside the red zone ended the scoring threat. The Volunteers finished the game off with a 15-play drive to run off the final nine minutes on the clock.
 The loss for Tallassee means the Tigers will be outside of the postseason for the third consecutive season, the program’s longest drought since 1982.

SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
 Here in the U.S., drones are about to take off, if you please. Deployed for surveillance by police and civilian agencies and even tested for crop dusting and pizza delivery. But the Washington Post reports this week that more than 400 military drones have crashed since 2001. The Post calls that a record of calamity that exposes the potential dangers of throwing open American skies to drone traffic. Through the Freedom of Information Act, the paper found that drones have already crashed into homes, highways, runways and once into a transport plane in flight. The year-long Post investigation discovered that a lot of drones crash because they're not equipped, like most airplanes, with anti-collision systems. And it turns out that piloting a drone with a joystick in a basement is actually a lot more tricky than playing the "Call of Duty" video game. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.

We’ve had to confront the global nature of today’s world. Everyone began hoarding supplies when the quarantine began because we realized our reliance on a global network for basic goods, and we feared it could collapse.
 In the face of this anxiety, insular thinking may feel like a logical response. We want to focus on protecting ourselves and fortifying our bubble walls, even at the expense of others. Things are too uncertain to afford extending a hand. But this mindset will only make unity harder.
 Heading into the election, unity might seem impossible. But if we learn from events this year, it’s really not. Society’s common good does not conflict with what’s beneficial for the individual. In the long term, we are not immune from each other’s problems — not from those of our neighbors, or from people in jail, or from those in mansions.
 I think we’ll find a silver lining to 2020. Despite the fear and grief, there’s still room in our bubbles for connection and empathy.

This coronavirus pandemic has affected us in many ways. Some of these are good, and others — well, they’re quite unpleasant, to say the least.
 The majority of students agree that this whole online schooling thing is a negative result of the virus. Most students would much rather be in school with their friends and teachers than being stuck at home all the time.
 School is a safe space for many students. Now, they're forced to stay at home, which for some can be a toxic environment. According to an Aug. 6 Mayo Clinc article titled "COVID-19 and the Risk of Suicide," anxiety and suicide rates are high because many people are feeling hopeless in these uncertain times.
 The coronavirus pandemic is a new experience. There have been a couple of winters where we were out of school for a few unexpected days, but there has never been anything quite like this.
 Speaking of snow days, did you know that it’s a huge decision for a school district to make when determining whether or not school should be closed for a whole day due to the weather? School leaders want what is best for students, and sometimes being at school in that safe environment is what is best for them and their mental health.

VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) — Polling stations opened Sunday across Lithuania for a parliamentary runoff election in which the winner will have to tackle a growing health crisis and high unemployment due to the coronavirus pandemic. The election is widely expected to bring about a change of leadership in the southernmost Baltic nation, which has been governed by a center-left coalition for four years. In the first round of voting on Oct. 11, three center-right opposition parties finished with a combined lead. In the second round, 68 of the 141 seats in Lithuania’s legislative assembly, the Seimas, are up for grabs. The other seats were allotted after the Oct. 11 first round of voting. The first round resulted in the conservative Homeland Union party winning 23 seats, or 24.8% of the vote, while the ruling Farmers and Greens party only grabbed 16 seats, or 17.5%. “If the conservatives are successful on Sunday, they would very likely try to form a new ruling coalition with other two center-right partners — the Freedom Party and the Liberal movement,” Vilnius University political scientist Tomas Janeliunas told The Associated Press. “Yet this would be a rather fragile majority.” Some 54 Homeland Union candidates made it into the runoff, while the Farmers and Greens have 32 contenders. Together, the Freedom Party and the Liberal movement have 21 candidates. Two other center-left parties that have crossed the 5% support threshold into parliament could join the Farmers and Greens in a new coalition but they have few candidates in the runoff. More than 7% of Lithuania’s 2.5 million voters have already cast early ballots for the runoff, according to election authorities who set up special drive-in polling stations because of the pandemic.

AJR has done it again with another amazing cut. The indie trio's new single, "Bummerland," dropped Aug. 30 and immediately made it to my playlist.
 The song is about quarantine and these crazy times. However, AJR managed to make an upbeat, playful and quirky tune out of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 During the chorus, the AJR sings: “Bummerland, give a cheer, ‘Cause you’re only going up from here.” The song's lyrics also contain quarantine anecdotes, such as references to bad haircuts and being broke, and all of this is presented in a funny and lively way. As usual, AJR has taken a mostly serious topic and showcased it in a humorous and lighthearted approach.
 The drums take center stage for the song's instrumental portion. About 2 minutes into the song's 3 minutes and 9 seconds, there is a flawless transition where singing morphs into a trumpet, guitar and, lastly, a violin. You can’t help but bob your head while you listen.
 The video is also fun to watch and the drums are, again, a key component and look incredible as a whole. The video really does bring the concept of "Bummerland" as an unconventional and crazy wonderland that has come to life as part of our everyday existence.
 As always, AJR blew me away. "Bummerland" is a must-listen song, for sure. The group knew exactly what kind of music was needed during this time in order to put a smile on faces. To use the title of the trio's previous song from earlier this year, AJR accomplishes this with creativity and a “Bang."

Being a Sunnyside High School Grizzly is nothing short of an experience. The second you step foot on campus during a typical school year, you can feel the excitement. You are surrounded by some of the smartest, most athletic, creative and musically inclined kids in the area.
 Students will constantly hear the story of how our graduation rate climbed from the worst to one of the best in the state. We will hear announcements every morning that always end in athletic director David Martinez saying “Have a great Grizzly day!” Students are greeted kindly by the secretaries whenever we go into the main office or the counseling office.
 You will probably hear people referring to us as Grizzly Nation. Students will have the line “It don’t matter where we go, we’ll always find a way back home” stuck in their head from the song “Back Home” by Andy Grammar.
 Sunnyside students will have “The Big 3 (Connect, Build and Envision)” and “Grizzly P.O.W.E.R. (Perseverance, Ownership, We before Me, Excellence and Respect)” ingrained in our head forever. And we will have chanted “We Are SHS” and our fight song about a million times by the time we graduate.
 At Sunnyside, students may fail, but then always remember to win the day. Students have an amazing support system at SHS. We will stay up until dawn doing our project for honors bio or the science fair.
 We anticipate hearing mariachi coming down the hallways on a teacher’s birthday. In every assembly we attend, students will probably strive to beat the senior class but I don’t think that has ever happened whether anyone may think they deserved it or not. We get dressed up for the holiday lunch and enjoy the amazing meal and caroling done by our Mr. SHS contestants. Traditionally, we go to spring fling in Marquez Plaza, followed by the luau a few weeks later.
 We go to basketball games and wrestling matches and experience the school and community coming together once again. Students and the community understand the change of energy at events without the band, cheer or dance groups.
