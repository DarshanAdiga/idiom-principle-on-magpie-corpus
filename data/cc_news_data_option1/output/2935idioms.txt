 As it weakened to a tropical storm Sunday morning, Hanna pushed inland through the Rio Grande Valley, leaving flooding and damage in its path in a wide swath of South Texas and northern Mexico.
 The storm made landfall at 5 p.m. Saturday as a Category 1 hurricane at Padre Island with sustained winds of 90 mph.
 Hanna was expected to produce 5 to 10 inches of rain with isolated totals of 15 inches through Sunday evening in South Texas.
 As of 6:50 a.m., the National Weather Service in Corpus Christi reported 2.86 inches at its station, 2.94 inches at Naval Air Station-Corpus Christi, 2.28 inches at Alice airport and 1.33 inches at Victoria airport.
 Liz Sommerville, a senior forecaster for the station, said there is a chance for severe thunderstorms all-day Sunday with a chance for strong winds, heavy rain and low-line, coastal flooding in the region.
 Coastal flooding will be especially evident in the northern and southern parts of Port Aransas on Sunday, said Liz Sommerville, a senior forecaster for the Corpus Christi weather station.
 \"Tropical Storm Hanna is starting to push west but we are still in a lot of the rain, stronger winds in the southern areas of Nueces, Jim Wells and Duval and a good chance for flash flooding,\" Sommerville said.
 A tornado watch is in effect in Corpus Christi, Kingsville, Falfurrias, Laredo, Zapata, McAllen and Brownsville until 10 p.m. Sunday. Windy conditions are expected to reach gusts of up to 40 mph from Corpus Christi to Laredo until 1 p.m. Sunday.

Pandemic maps are all the rage, these days, but the latest one from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is a little different; instead of viral hotspots, it displays a plague of official snoopiness, arranged by location and sortable by technology. While it documents intrusions that predate the current crisis, the Atlas of Surveillance is all too relevant to the age of coronavirus. Concerns about curtailing contagion help to normalize detailed scrutiny of people's lives and drive us toward a pervasive surveillance state.
