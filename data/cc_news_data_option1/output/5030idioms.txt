But the political considerations for congressional Republicans cut differently, given the most immediate goal is the defense of the party's majority in the Senate. Holding onto Georgia's two Senate seats means maximizing Republican turnout on January 5, which requires keeping the party's most reliable motivator, Trump, happy. And for the time being, there's little members of Congress can actually do to affect the outcome of the race -- barring a successful long-shot bid in the House of Representatives to overturn the presidential election -- except to agitate.

Get ready for buckets of drama: Mario Lopez is Col. Harland Sanders in a new mini-movie sponsored by — you guessed it — KFC.
 Those who haven’t tired of playing I Love You, Colonel Sanders! A Finger Lickin’ Good Dating Simulator should grab their popcorn ahead of “A Recipe for Seduction,” which is aimed at women who love men who love chicken. A trailer for the flick dropped Monday, revealing a tongue-in-cheek take on the Lifetime romance movie genre.
 “As the holidays draw near, a young heiress contends with the affections of a suitor handpicked by her mother. When the handsome chef, Harland Sanders, arrives with his secret fried chicken recipe and a dream, he sets in motion a series of events that unravels the mother’s devious plans,” reads the description on the channel’s website.
 Perfect. 2020. Gift. (Not to mention an interesting departure from Lopez’s current star turn as A.C. Slater in Peacock’s acclaimed revival of “Saved by the Bell.”)

Jackman has been sharing quite a few photos in recent months documenting his life and his experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic for fans and followers alike. Last month, Jackman shared a photo of himself with Ryan Reynolds, both of them masked up in the behind the scenes look at the commercial they made for Sam's Club to promote their respective beverage companies as well as support a good cause. Prior to that, Jackman also shared a photo of himself in a mask for his Laughing Man Coffee Company, both encouraging people to mask up but also promoting the company. The Laughing Man Foundation supports coffee farming communities by "investing in programs that lead the way for health, growth, and success for coffee farmers and their families."


  While it's not clear what sort of call Jackman was preparing for, prior to the pandemic the entertainer was supposed to be very busy during this time of year. The actor was scheduled to star in _The Music Man_ on Broadway with previews beginning in September and officially opening on October 15th. All Broadway performances have been pushed back until next year, and _The Music Man_ is currently expected to begin previews in April (for now). When the latest delay was announced, Jackman wrote, "When Broadway is ready for us ... we'll be ready for you!"


  And Jackman isn't the only celebrity giving followers a glimpse at what working from home looks like for them. _Supernatural_ star Jared Padalecki recently shared a set of work from home photos to his Instagram that any parent trying to juggle the office and home life in 2020 can relate to.

After all, sustainability is relatively young as a concept. It's really only been around since the late 80s, defined in the famous Brundtland Report as a way of framing urgent environmental issues and guiding the world's response to them. But there's no great track record of success since then. One could legitimately argue that sustainability hasn't worked. "Virtually across the board, sustainability indicators have continued to move since the early 1990s in the wrong direction." Other academics have been saying this for a while, such as John Foster, who gets a mention here.

  The federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.


  That means that if you work a full-time job at minimum wage -- 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year -- you will earn a whopping $15,080 annual salary. That's unacceptable for a plethora of reasons, the main one being that no worker can survive on such a paltry amount, let alone support a family.


  So it's important for us to note when a big employer in our region goes above and beyond. We'd like to praise Stormont Vail Health, then, for raising its minimum wage to $15 an hour, an important step. This makes Stormont Vail both a more attractive employer for potential workers, as well as one that supports those on the lower end of the pay scale.


  The move toward a higher minimum wage has caught fire across the country. Some states have taken action on their own, while some large businesses -- Amazon and Target among them -- have done so, too.


  Kansas, unfortunately, hasn't taken action on the state level. That puts downward pressure on families and workers just beginning their careers. That also makes it easier for big employers with cash on hand to raise wages unilaterally, and puts pressure on smaller businesses that may simply not have the cushion to do so.


  We understand the minimum wage can be controversial. Whole books could be written on the topic, and indeed have been.


  But surely the more businesses and institutions that offer a living wage, the better it is for all of us. Yes, some prices may increase if it means paying workers more. But workers making more will likely be better motivated and more likely to stay at a business -- thus ultimately reducing training and recruitment costs.


  After a decade-long economic recovery that was distinguished by both its sluggishness and the gigantic amount of wealth accumulated by those at the very top, workers in Kansas and across the nation are justified in being skeptical about their employers. Surely we can all agree that someone who puts in an honest day's worth has the right to a wage that supports himself or herself and their loved ones?


  Kudos to those employers making that happen right now. And for those who might not be able to make that work right now, we understand. We hope the state and federal governments will support a more equitable structure -- and support workers across the board.

There will be a new guard in the Kansas Senate next session.


   


  With a collective 54 years of experience leaving, by choice or by force, in the state's upper chamber, members picked a fresh crop of leaders Monday at the Statehouse.


   


  Out go Senate President Susan Wagle, R-Wichita, and Senate Majority Leader Jim Denning, R-Overland Park, who both opted to retire.


   


  In walks a conservative leadership team set to square off with Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly on a wide range of issues.


   


  That will include the COVID-19 pandemic response, a likely push for tax cuts and Medicaid expansion in Kansas, a policy proposal likely on life support with the new Republican caucus.


   


  Sen. Ty Masterson, R-Andover, was tapped unanimously as Senate president, while Sen. Gene Suellentrop, R-Wichita, will replace Denning as majority leader.


   


  "I was honored to get unanimous support and I hope it brings unity to our caucus," Masterson told reporters after the vote.


   


  Democrats will also have new leadership in the chamber, after longtime Minority Leader Anthony Hensley lost in November after a tenure stretching over four decades, the longest in Kansas political history.


   


  Instead, taking on the role of floor leader will be Sen. Dinah Sykes, D-Lenexa, who was a Republican as recently as two years ago before changing parties in 2018. She will be the first woman to serve in the role.


   


  Sykes joked that Hensley would remain on "speed dial" and she noted that replacing the Topeka lawmaker would be a tall task.


   


  "We are ending a historic year with COVID and there is a lot of opportunity," Sykes said after the vote. "I look forward to working with the caucus and building on the foundation that Anthony started."


   


  On the Republican side, the leadership votes signal a caucus that remains conservative, with the Senate likely to be shaped by a crop of new lawmakers, many of whom are replacing more moderate Republicans in Topeka.


   


  Sen. Rick Wilborn, R-McPherson, will replace Sen. Jeff Longbine, R-Emporia, as Senate vice president.


   


  Assistant majority leader will be Sen. Larry Alley, R-Winfield, while Sen. Richard Hildebrand, R-Galena, will serve as majority whip.


   


  Masterson acknowledged that the leadership team underscored a more conservative group of lawmakers but said it was a sign the caucus was moving to better reflect where the state was at politically.


   


  "Candidly, I think it better represents the people of Kansas," he said.


   


  But Sen. Carolyn McGinn, R-Sedgwick, said after the vote that she wished the leadership slate was more representative of the state, both in terms of ideology and geography.


   


  McGinn, who lost the majority leader race to Suellentrop, expressed concern that rural districts like hers would be left behind.


   


  "I hope that everybody comes together to see what the fairness factor is across the state, to make sure we represent our constituents," she said.


   


  Masterson said the agenda in January will likely include extending federal tax cuts pushed by President Donald Trump to the state level, changing how judges are selected and taking a long-term look at the governor's executive powers in an emergency.


   


  There were "tough odds," Masterson continued, for Medicaid expansion, a top priority for Kelly.


   


  While he said he hoped "nothing much" would change from the prior two years in terms of the working relationship with Kelly and her team, Masterson said he wanted the Legislature to continue to hold the Kelly administration in check.


   


  "I think fundamentally that is the purpose of this body, to be a check on the executive branch and the governor," Masterson said.


   


  In a statement, Kelly expressed congratulations to the new team.


   


  "I look forward to working together on the issues that matter to Kansans: funding schools, keeping Kansans healthy and increasing access to affordable health care, building a stronger infrastructure, and continuing down the path to economic recovery," the governor said.


   


  Sykes maintained that Democrats would again push for Medicaid expansion and expressed optimism that the new leaders on the other side of the aisle would be amenable to compromise.


   


  "We have a fine relationship and we may not agree on policy but we can sit down and have conversations," she said.


   


  House Republicans make history with leadership vote


   


  For House Republicans, there wasn't much change in leadership with the exception of the caucus chair, Rep. Ken Rahjes, R-Agra.


   


  Rep. Ron Ryckman, R-Olathe, was elected House speaker again without opposition, making history as the first speaker in Kansas history to serve a third term.


   


  "He has shown us the ability to be a good negotiator even with our governor, who for some reason still acts as a minority member of the Senate, rather than a leader of Kansas," said Rep. Brenda Landwehr, R-Wichita, who nominated him.


   


  "I'm humbled and honored by this opportunity to lead during these remarkable times. We have a lot of work to do," Ryckman said in a text message.


   


  Rep. Dan Hawkins, R-Wichita, will stay on as House majority leader without opposition, as colleagues praised him for being good leader.


   


  "I'm incredibly honored our Republican caucus has elected me to serve a second term as House Majority Leader, and I commit to providing conservative leadership as we rebuild the Kansas economy, address a massive budget deficit, defend life, and protect our Kansas way of life," Hawkins said in a statement.


   


  House Democrats, who will have little power in a GOP supermajority, saw changes as well, except at the top level.


   


  Rep. Tom Sawyer, D-Wichita, maintains his role as minority leader. Meanwhile, Rep. Jason Probst, D-Hutchinson, was elected assistant minority leader and Rep. Stephanie Clayton, D-Overland Park, became the minority whip.


   


  "I think that he is somebody is truly a leader in this building and ... somebody who I'm very proud to call my leader," Rep. Mike Amyx, D-Lawrence, said of Sawyer.

Knowing that the Kardashian-Jenner family tends to invite a large group to the event and spare no expense (Kourtney Kardashian reportedly spent an estimated $440,000 on the 2019 event and Kim Kardashian West shelled out an estimated $1.3 million the year prior), people were angered that they were still having the party and using tests for their friends.
 Even though the family ended up canceling this year's Christmas party, they found themselves in hot water in early November after Kendall Jenner threw a crowded 25th birthday party where few guests appeared to wear masks.
 Kris Jenner, Kendall's mother, defended the supermodel and said all of the party-goers were tested before attending the event on an episode of SiriusXM's "Andy Cohen Live."

November was MSNBC's most-watched month in its 24-year history. But the channel finds itself in a challenging competitive landscape at the end of President Trump's time in office. In November the channel still ranked third in cable news behind CNN and Fox News, since cable news viewership was up across the board during the election period.


  MSNBC's biggest strengths are political talk shows like "The Rachel Maddow Show" and "The Beat with Ari Melber," which have big and loyal audiences.


  Conde's memo credited Griffin with "six straight record years" in the ratings, "each one better than the last," which is in part a testament to intense interest in Trump's campaign and presidency.


  The beginning of the Biden presidency may scramble the cable news wars in ways that remain to be seen.


  Jones has been at MSNBC and NBC News since 2013. She previously worked at The Weather Channel and at local stations. She rose through the ranks at NBC and became the senior vice president for specials in 2017.


  Jones' portfolio was expanded earlier this year when she was put in charge of MSNBC's daytime and weekend news schedule.


  "In the last year alone that has meant, of course, that she has masterfully guided our coverage of the global pandemic, the social justice protests and unrest, Decision 2020, and the two most-viewed Democratic presidential debates in television history," Conde wrote on Monday.

The federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.


   


  That means that if you work a full-time job at minimum wage -- 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year -- you will earn a whopping $15,080 annual salary. That's unacceptable for a plethora of reasons, the main one being that no worker can survive on such a paltry amount, let alone support a family.


   


  So it's important for us to note when a big employer in our region goes above and beyond. We'd like to praise Stormont Vail Health, then, for raising its minimum wage to $15 an hour, an important step. This makes Stormont Vail both a more attractive employer for potential workers, as well as one that supports those on the lower end of the pay scale.


   


  The move toward a higher minimum wage has caught fire across the country. Some states have taken action on their own, while some large businesses -- Amazon and Target among them -- have done so, too.


   


  Kansas, unfortunately, hasn't taken action on the state level. That puts downward pressure on families and workers just beginning their careers. That also makes it easier for big employers with cash on hand to raise wages unilaterally, and puts pressure on smaller businesses that may simply not have the cushion to do so.


   


  We understand the minimum wage can be controversial. Whole books could be written on the topic, and indeed have been.


   


  But surely the more businesses and institutions that offer a living wage, the better it is for all of us. Yes, some prices may increase if it means paying workers more. But workers making more will likely be better motivated and more likely to stay at a business -- thus ultimately reducing training and recruitment costs.


   


  After a decade-long economic recovery that was distinguished by both its sluggishness and the gigantic amount of wealth accumulated by those at the very top, workers in Kansas and across the nation are justified in being skeptical about their employers. Surely we can all agree that someone who puts in an honest day's worth has the right to a wage that supports himself or herself and their loved ones?


   


  Kudos to those employers making that happen right now. And for those who might not be able to make that work right now, we understand. We hope the state and federal governments will support a more equitable structure -- and support workers across the board.
