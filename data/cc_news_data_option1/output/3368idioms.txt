 The 5-2-1-0 plan is one of the easiest methods for creating healthy habits in our children. I use this plan frequently when I am counseling families about living healthier lives, and the truth is it actually works for the whole family.
 What is 5-2-1-0? Several programs across the United States utilize this message, and a quick online search will direct you to a ton of resources that you can access. In a nutshell, it is a simple message of how to cultivate healthier habits.
 The “5” stands for having at least that many servings of fruits and vegetables each day. We know that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables is associated with lower rates of chronic disease. Because these foods have a higher water content, they are also lower in calories, and that helps with weight management. Replacing other snacks with fruits and vegetables is a simple way to increase your intake as you aim for those 5 servings.

 Plenty enthusiastic
 Republicans and Fox News are telling us that Joe Biden voters lack enthusiasm. My own eagerness to vote for Biden is over the moon. Till the South Carolina primary, I was absolutely tepid in my support for Biden. He and I are within about a month of each other in age. I thought he was too old; I’m OK with Biden’s imperfections. Why am I now so eager to vote for Biden? I want the worst president in the history of the republic out of office. President Donald Trump has eclipsed such stars as Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan, and I can only imagine the relief their descendants feel.
 Trump has ignored or thumbed his orange nose at every custom and norm established for the presidency, ignored the Constitution (emoluments clause) and put officials in place to serve his interests in opposition to the needs of the country. I suspect that my eagerness to vote for Biden is mirrored all over the nation, and that wave will soon rid us of this canker on the Constitution, this bubo on the Bill of Rights, this second crack in the Liberty Bell.

 Touch is imperative
 I know and share Dena Ducane’s frustrations (“ ‘I did not sign up for this,’ ” Aug. 22). My wife has dementia and lives in a care facility. Before the pandemic, I saw her twice a day. Care of these residents focuses on safety and health care, not the mental state of the people in care. The safety focus dictates limiting access to professional caregivers and minimizing potential harms such as falls, bedsores and other issues. Even when family caregivers meet the same criteria as professional caregivers, they get treated as potential risks. The result is isolation for those in care. From my experience, residents do not understand window visits. FaceTime works better but lacks the essential loving ingredient, _touch_. I do not want to wait until my wife is dying to provide her with compassionate care.
 Anyone who has a loved one in assisted living, nursing or memory care should read _Being Mortal_ by Atul Gawande. I have learned that the care of the elderly could be so much better than it is now. The changes need to start with the Department of Health to rethink what care and safety mean when those in care will never get well and leave. At the same time, providers need to improve the living conditions to allow a wide variety of stimulation. _Being Mortal_ is a great place to begin this transformation.

So yes, I think there's a lot of work being done and a lot of time being spent on how to make those interfaces appealing and acceptable to people in some of the ways I described. I think on the level of our business, digital signage, thinking back on the concept of utility touchscreens roles for marketing purposes has been very difficult to implement successfully. You've probably seen Microsoft, like those surface tables in bank branches, they came in and then they went away, interactive kiosks came in and then they went away. We've done a lot of things with touch through bank windows, we've done QR codes, we've done scannable brochures, that launch interactive experiences, printing brochures on demand, and all of them face the same challenge that they require a customer to prolong their visit in the bank branch and they're not delivering really clear apparent utilities. So it is just at the level of the basics. The tougher problem with all that, I think, is not just managing people's concerns about hygiene today but just the use of it at all.

NEW YORK (AP) — Following years of fending off going to prison, former New York Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver is about to begin serving time.
 Silver, 76, is due to report on Wednesday to a federal prison in Otisville, New York, after being sentenced earlier this year to 6 1/2 years behind bars in a corruption case that toppled him from his longtime position as one of the state’s most powerful politicians.
 Messages were left on Tuesday seeking comment from Silver's lawyers on the surrender.
 The Democrat was ousted as speaker in 2015 and convicted later that year, but appeals had kept him out of prison. His conviction in federal court in Manhattan was overturned on appeal before he was convicted again in 2018.
 Part of that conviction was then tossed out on another appeal, leading to yet another sentencing in July where he asked a judge not to let him die in prison. His lawyers had sought a term of home confinement, arguing that sending him to prison would worsen existing health issues or risk having him die from the coronavirus.
 But District Judge Valerie Caproni said she had no option but to finally punish him for what she called “corruption, pure and simple.”

A new era of Illinois High School Association softball has arrived.
   
 Starting in spring 2021, Louisville Slugger Sports Complex in Peoria will host all four classes of the softball state finals, the IHSA Board of Directors voted Monday. The contract runs until 2025.
   
 EastSide Centre in East Peoria had hosted the finals since 2001.
   
 "We're excited for the opportunity to put on a first-class show," LSSC director of operations Joe Bolen said. "The facility, the fields, the video board, the side-by-side setup of the championship fields, all lend to a way to put on a fan and player experience that is special."
   
 Bolen says the Slugger Complex will use the blueprint of what Carver Arena did for the boys basketball state finals -- hold a softball version of the March Madness Experience. This will be a family-friendly environment with several interactive softball elements.
   
 "Bat demos, mall vendors, there will be no doubt when you drive in that you are at the IHSA state finals," he said.
   
 The collective amenities offered at Petersen Hotels Field -- the future site of the collective finals -- are hard to find at most, if not any, Illinois softball venues.
   
 The main field includes an all-weather turf surrounded by 1,000 grandstand seats along with covered bleachers on each base line, a right centerfield video board, in-ground dugouts each with individual restrooms. Also, featured at the field are lights for night games and batting cages.
   
 The field has hosted IHSA supersectionals and the Missouri Valley Conference softball championships. It also is the home field of the Bradley softball program.
   
 LSSC won hosting rights over EastSide, which bid for the finals again, along with Chicago Bandits Stadium in Rosemont, Rantoul Family Sports Complex and Southern Illinois University in Carbondale.
   
 "Assuming we can play softball to a state championship in the summer, Louisville Slugger will be the host," IHSA executive director Craig Anderson said. "They put together a nice bid. Their facility is really top notch. All things combined, the board headed that direction.
   
 "We are excited for the tourney to remain in the Peoria area, and incredibly thankful for all that the Eastside Centre and its staff have done for this tournament through the years," Anderson continued in a release. "Thank you to all the groups who submitted bids. They are all amazing places to watch softball and help highlight why the sport is thriving in our state."
   
 Addie Welsh is very familiar with Petersen Hotels Field. During its run to the 2019 Class 1A runner-up finish, Illini Bluffs punched its ticket to the state finals with a supersectional victory there following a move to the turf after successive rainouts at the original site.
   
 The now senior second baseman specifically points to the arena-like atmosphere Petersen Hotels Field creates. In fact, Welsh is the perfect ambassador for the Slugger Complex, committing earlier this month to play softball for Bradley, which hosts all its home games at Petersen Hotels Field.
   
 "The stadium, itself, is pretty cool," Welsh said. "That's something that not a lot of people get to experience. Every time I've ever been there it's been a great experience.
   
 "Even just thinking about playing there in high school for a lot of girls is a huge accomplishment because most colleges don't have that nice of a facility."
   
 The facility is one that Ed Olehy has called home since 2016. The Notre Dame softball coach was pleased when he heard the news that potentially two additional home games could be possible on the final days of the season.
   
 "Just the fact to have it there," Olehy said. "Just the fact that's our home field. All of that stuff is a huge feather in our cap, I guess I would say. Just because we're so proud of it.
   
 "I just don't think that there's any place that really compares to that facility out there - the ability that they have with the electronics, the all- weather field … "
   
 With some potential state finals teams playing on grass all season, a possible criticism of the Slugger Complex is having the season's most important games on turf. Olehy says he's interested to see the reaction on social media, even reading the potential debates sparked by those in favor of a grass field over turf and vice versa.
   
 But he's definitely in favor of playing on turf.
   
 "It plays a little bit quicker," Olehy said. "What we found is it really plays a lot more true, especially in the outfield. You're not getting balls bouncing over your glove in the outfield a lot of times. You're getting a lot true roller. It doesn't take a lot of time to adjust to it.
   
 "We have found that it's harder to adjust to go to a field that's not in very good shape with balls bouncing all over the place or really slow in the dirt. If you get a good, well-prepared field, it plays quick just like the turf does. … The biggest difference would be the ball does bounce more. In the end, the benefits sure have outweighed the negatives, if there are any."

As well as benefitting high streets and the public, tax equality would make general economic sense - it is an important principle of taxation that taxes should be fair and equitable. It makes no sense for supermarkets, often operating outside town centres, to have a tax advantage. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has recently closed the VAT gap between the on and off-trade, by temporarily reducing VAT on food sales in the on-trade to 5%. If this major step towards tax equality is maintained in the long term, it will result in a significant increase in investment and employment in the on-trade."

 A Street Roots report on her book says “many of the neurological keys to feeling empathy are missing from the exchange” when we communicate through texts, email and social media posts.
 Communicating electronically, not face to face, there’s no eye contact, and no paying attention to body language and facial expressions.
 Without such visual emotional cues, Riess says, we’re left with words on a screen, leading to detachment, emotional indifference – and, we are all noticing more, some very nasty tweets.

Sandra Sue Wayne, 73, of Warrensburg, passed away Sunday, August 23, 2020 in Warrensburg.
 She was born February 3rd, 1947, in Kansas City to Grace Adams and adopted by Grace's first cousin Erma (Adams) Stevens (later Leap). Raised in KC's Northeast, she graduated from Northeast High School in 1965 and worked at Sears and the I.R.S. before becoming a news adapter at the Army Home Town News Center, Independence & Hardesty, KC. Coworkers there encouraged her to further her education; after taking several courses at Penn Valley, she made the jump to CMSU in 1970. Sandra earned a BS in English in 1974 and her MS in Mass Communications in 1977. As a Graduate Assistant at the CMSU Museum, she created & promoted a monthly old time music show featuring local acoustic musicians.
 Sandra waited tables at Warrensburg's Breeze Inn where she met a number of Air Force officers, including her future husband, Bill. She invited herself to accompany him to a skeet shoot on March 15th, 1971; they married in the historic Old Courthouse on April 30, 1977.
 Sandra followed Bill to stations at Chanute AFB, IL, Cleveland, OH, and Griffiss AFB, Rome NY. In Illinois she worked as a PR specialist at the state Soil Conservation Service office – a high point of this job was taking aerial photos leaning out the door of a single engine plane. In Cleveland, she was an adjunct at the local community college and worked in DCASR personnel. In New York she again taught at a community college and wrote humorously informative columns for the Officers' Wives Club newsletter. She also was noted for painting outdoor scenes on rocks, given as door prizes at their annual Halloween party. After Bill retired in 1986, they returned to Warrensburg, where they operated Cedarcroft Farm Bed & Breakfast at her Great-grandfather John A. Adams' farm from 1988-2016. Wherever she went, she made friends easily because she liked people.
 Sandra & Bill loved to travel by car, visiting each of the lower 48 states and 4 Canadian provinces. Sandra most loved the Southwest, especially New Mexico. It gave her the opportunity to shine at her favorite hobby, photography. She won numerous prizes at local art shows and the Missouri State Fair.
 Sandra was also a writer; Sweet Gum Press published one volume of her poetry with a second set for release this fall. Sandra was a promoter: she loved to get involved with events and organizations to help them succeed. She worked with Blind Boone Park, Mid-Missouri Artists, and various tourism and historical groups.
 Sandra's birth mother & adopted mother predeceased her, along with half- brother Gary Burnett and aunt Catherine (Adams) Shumate, horses Star, Buddy, Scruffy and Ahab, and assorted cats. She is survived by her husband William T. (Bill) Wayne, half-brother Wayne Burnett, Warsaw, half-sisters Glenda McCullough (Don) and Patty Burnett of Kansas City, Uncle Murray Kugler of Las Cruces, NM and feline friends Topsy, Cisco & Timmy. Memorial contributions are suggested to the Adams Memorial Cemetery or Pleasant Bethel Baptist Church and can be left in care of Sweeney-Phillips & Holdren Funeral Home. A celebration of life will be held at a later date.

According to the latest report by NCRB (National Crime Record Bureau) India, at least 10,349 people working in the farm sector ended their lives in 2018. With a hike in price, uncertainness in agriculture productivity, less recognition and respects in society farmers complains that the present generation of India does not want to join agriculture, instead they want to have good education and opt for other safer professions. This dismal condition of agriculture in India, has compelled farmers to commit suicides. In such context, agritourism can bring a light of hope and serve as a platform for the farmers to increase their source of income which would finally benefit agriculture as well as tourism sectors of India and thereby contribute to the sustainable growth of the country. According to Dr. M.S. Swaminathan agrarian activities will be the only sector for this country which will provide major job opportunities for youth and we all have noticed that the outlook of the present policy on agriculture by the central government is focused on these areas. At the same time the excessive use of modern agriculture technologies caused damages to the local ecology and in returns from farming are slow and low of which the price is determined not by the farmer but middle men or agents. Hence, the existing generation guides their next generation to undertake any other profession but agriculture; which has potential of quick and assured income along with dignity. The outcome of this is that the rural areas are still fumbling for survival and our ecosystems are in deserted condition. To save, all this Agro Rural Tourism (ART) centers come up to protect the ecology by avoiding plastics, by promoting greenery and biodiversity by creating water bodies; protecting and highlighting medicinal plants and flora and fauna. Thus, these centers will be the strong pillars of the rural India and will also support sustainable development to achieve one of the key development activities in the region and ensure conducive conditions to address the issues of unemployment, revenue generation and the ability of IHR (Indian Himalayan Region) communities and the environment to absorb and equitably benefit from the impact of tourism in a sustainable way. A concept, agri-eco-tourism entails visiting a working farm or any agriculture, horticulture or agribusiness operation, for the purpose of enjoyment, education or active involvement in the activities of the farm or operation. The concept is to tap the vast market of inland urban tourists who want to take a break from a mechanical life and enjoy the peace and tranquility of rural life in its natural abundance. It is the new value-added agricultural business, for improving the incomes and potential economic viability of small farms and rural communities. It can take many forms like roadside stands or on farm direct sales, which can offer farm-fresh produce to travelers as well as interaction with growers and moreover can end farmers' isolation and offers the opportunity to make new friends and build stronger links to the community. Agro-ecotourism is a secure multifunctional, sustainable and competitive agriculture, maintain the landscape and the countryside, contribute to the vitality of rural communities, respond to consumer concerns and demands regarding food quality and safety, environmental protection, animal welfare, etc. The first dimension of Agro-ecotourism, agriculture include activities which aimed to the use of natural resources for the welfare of the human being by including all primary activities of production. The second-dimension ecosystem is related to biodiversity, organic farming system and ecological systems and third dimension for tourism. Countries like Australia, Canada, Philippines, Latvia, Italy, Turkey, Switzerland, US and UK are harnessing agro-ecotourism successfully and in India, Pandurang Taware "Father of Agro-tourism concept and the founder of Agro-tourism development Corporation(ATDC), winner for the "Best contribution to conserving cultural heritage" in 2011 has left no stone unturned to make it successful concept. In India, the villages are taking positive steps in the field of agro-ecotourism, the cases of few agro-tourists spots will reflect idea about its popularity, the places like Morachi Chincholi Village in Pune district of Maharashtra has emerged as one of the most successful agri-tourist destinations. The activities like bullock-cart ride, rural and outdoor games, bird watching, nursery, camping and tent facilities and organic farming are being provided to the tourists. Another agro-tourist spot in Uttarakhand Called "ROSE" (Rural Opportunity for Social Elevation) nestled in the hills of kumaon and situated in the Bageshwar district worked with agri-tourism model where the tourists can avail homestays amidst the wheat fields and scenic mountain views and indulge in regular work like cooking, harvesting of crops, building of toilets, teaching English to the school kids and many other activities. The agro-spot in Zuluk or Dzuluk , in lower Himalayan in East Sikkim is another offbeat tourist destination. Because of rough terrain, the tourist enjoys the taste of Sikkimese hospitality. Montana Homestay is one such example of how villagers reach out to promote their share of goodness along with the bounty of nature. The success of such home stays lie in the fact that one can stay in the natural way and be rooted to the earthiness. Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC) has come up with a unique concept of agri-tourism to promote rural tourism and would be showcasing integrated lush green horticulture farms, dairy, fishing, vegetable poly houses having even guest houses for tourists to stay for a couple of days or more and to get exposure to rural rustic life and natural environment and also to rural eateries reminding one of the days of our grandmothers and fathers. Every State of India are coming up with the idea to promote agro- ecotourism, as of believe that real India lies in the rural areas and to simply multiply the income of farmers.

Damian Lillard is out of Game 5 on Wednesday with a right knee sprain, deepening the blow to the Portland Trail Blazers, who face a 3-1 deficit in the best-of-seven series with the Los Angeles Lakers.
 Lillard left Monday's Game 4 against the Lakers in the third quarter. He missed the remainder of the game. His status for Game 5 was announced Tuesday afternoon after a pair of MRIs confirmed the injury.
 The dynamic scorer has been the heart and soul of the Trail Blazers since the NBA's restart late last month.
 He guided the team to a 6-2 record to close out the regular season in the NBA bubble as the Blazers earned a spot in a play-in series against the Memphis Grizzlies. Portland advanced into the first round with a 126-122 victory as Lillard scored 31 points with 10 assists.
 He averaged 37.6 points per game over the final eight regular-season contests, digging even deeper over the final three must-win games, scoring 51.3 points per contest, including a 61-point game Aug. 11 against the Dallas Mavericks. He finished the season scoring 30.0 points with 8.0 rebounds.
 In four games of the first-round series he has been held to 24.3 points per game. He has a pair of 34-point games, including one in Portland's Game 1 victory. He scored just 11 points in 27 minutes of Game 4 before the injury occurred.
 "Not good," Blazers coach Terry Stotts told reporters after falling behind 3-1 in the series. "It's a tough position against a good team. We'll regroup, it's one game at a time, you can break out all the cliches. But we know what we're up against when you're down to a good team 3-1. So we've got to battle."
 Lillard's injury occured on a drive to the basket with 7:16 remaining in the third quarter after an awkward plant of his leg. He was also playing after he dislocated his left index finger in Game 2.

 BOGOTA, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Colombia is in discussions to join other phase three clinical trials for a 7 vaccine, the health minister said on Tuesday, and will not reverse an end to its national quarantine.
 The government said on Monday that Colombia, which has nearly 552,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and is finishing more than five months of lockdown at the end of August, would participate in trials with Johnson & Johnson.
 "We are also talking with other companies about the possibility of holding clinical trials," Health Minister Fernando Ruiz told Reuters in a telephone interview. He could not name the companies because of confidentiality restrictions.
 The price per vaccine dose is still uncertain, Ruiz said, but Colombia is estimating a cost of $20 and investment of some 1.5 trillion pesos ($390 million) to initially vaccinate health workers and other high-risk people.
 "Our strategy is to look for multilateral mechanisms where countries get together to buy and that ensures coverage for 20% of the population," Ruiz said. "Colombia has to be a careful buyer because it's not a country with unlimited resources."
 Colombia has spent around $3 billion on its healthcare system amid the pandemic, Ruiz said, and will soon double its number of intensive care unit (ICU) beds from 5,600.
 Many restrictions have been gradually loosened during the lockdown, but its end will mean open roads and increased national flights, though international transport and large events remain banned.
 Ruiz said the quarantine had delayed the peak of the pandemic, which otherwise could have infected 250,000 people a day and collapsed the healthcare system.
 "I don't think selective isolation measures will be reversed. We're seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, we're passing the hardest period," Ruiz said.
 "That doesn't mean there will not be new flare-ups but we have the capacity to trace them and do a focused containment." (Reporting by Luis Jaime Acosta; Writing by Julia Symmes Cobb; editing by John Stonestreet)

Even before they began their Western Conference first-round series, the Dallas Mavericks were a long shot to get past the Los Angeles Clippers.
 Injuries and ejections early in the best-of-seven series made the road even more difficult, but the Mavericks have overcome those obstacles to twice even the series heading into Game 5 on Tuesday night near Orlando.
 Despite playing on a tender left ankle, Dallas forward Luka Doncic put the Mavericks on his shoulders in Game 4 on Sunday and lifted them to victory against second-seeded Los Angeles. He led them back from a 21-point first-half deficit and later hit the game-winning 3-pointer at the overtime buzzer in the 135-133 victory.
 The 21-year-old from Slovenia finished with 43 points, 17 rebounds and 13 assists, becoming the youngest player in NBA history with a 40-point triple- double during the playoffs.
 His buzzer beater, combined with his stat line and the physical limitations caused by the ankle injury that forced him out late in the Game 3 loss, has made Doncic one of the most talked about players since the season restarted.
 "He's got such a great heart," Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. "Guys like him, Jason Kidd, Larry Bird, these kinds of guys, are such great competitors. Not much will keep them from competing. They're from the same fabric in terms of their ability to impact the game in unique forms. It's not just about putting the ball in the basket. It's about giving teammates confidence."
 Doncic not only needed to shake off his sore ankle and play in Game 4 to give the Mavericks a chance to even the series, but he had to pick up the slack for 7-foot-3 center Kristaps Porzingis, who sat out with a sore right knee.
 Porzingis, who averaged 20.4 points and 9.5 rebounds during the regular season, had an MRI following the game on Sunday and the results were negative. He has been ruled out for Game 5.
 The Clippers likely would be on the verge of closing out the series or already waiting for their next opponent if star forward Paul George had played to expectations, especially in the past three games.
 He's shooting 21.3 percent from the floor in those three games, including 4-for-25 from 3-point range.
 George averaged 21.5 points during the regular season, shooting 43.9 percent from the floor and 41.2 from 3-point distance.
 "If I make shots, this series could be a little different, and that's the obvious," George said after shooting 3-for-14 in Game 4. "I'm getting looks, getting shots, the floor is open, the defenders aren't great, but I'm just having a hard time finding the ball through right now."
 Clippers coach Doc Rivers said he'd like to see a better mindset from all his players, calling them "emotionally weak" during Game 4.
 "You can see the difference in spirits," Rivers said. "They make a run, and everybody is excited. They make a run on us, and we cave-in. So that's on all of us. Me too. I've got to get our guys right."

The proposal would allocate $300 million to the state Natural Resources Agency for prescribed burns, home hardening, defensible space and other projects to reduce risks in California’s wildland-urban interface regions, and $300 million to reduce fire risks and repair damage at state parks. In addition, $200 million would be distributed by the California Wildlife Conservation Board for forest restoration and wildfire resilience, and $300 million would be set aside for projects such as cooling centers and solar power.
 Assemblyman Richard Bloom (D-Santa Monica), who will introduce the bill, said the current wildfires added a sense of urgency to plans in the Legislature to do more to prevent wildfires before the pandemic hit and the economy collapsed.
 “This is, to some degree, born out of that desire to do something in that space, but it became imperative as we watched this recent series of fires rage through the state,” Bloom said.
 The bill’s reliance on another extension of a fee on customers of Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric is already raising concerns among some lawmakers.

In September, one Portsmouth mother plans to send her two young children to school for in-person learning, should that be the route the school district takes.
   
 But Melissa Desjardins is also planning for another possibility should the district switch to distance learning: a pod.
   
 There would be perhaps five or six families in her pod, Desjardins said in a phone call with The Daily News. And the pseudo-classrooms would rotate from one household to the next, maybe.
   
 But those pod plans are nascent and contingent on what the state opts to do, Desjardins acknowledged. Such uncertainty doesn't prohibit parental planning when it comes to education, but it makes it difficult.
   
 Gov. Gina Raimondo recently moved to push the start of the public school year back two weeks, to Sept. 14. The state also delayed until the week of Aug. 31 the decision on whether each school will have students return fully in-person, fully online or follow some sort of hybrid model.
   
 "I think most of us are just preparing to go to distance learning at some point," Desjardins said. "I'm just trying to be proactive."
   
 The coronavirus shut down public schools in the spring and children received education via distance learning. They engaged with their teachers through their computer screens and homes became classrooms.
   
 Raimondo, during her coronavirus press briefing Monday, said that distance learning "is absolutely not a substitute for in-person learning," and noted the struggles of some students and families with the distance learning model.
   
 She said she was committed to "get children in school and keep them and their teachers safe." But for parents who aren't ready to send their kids back for in-person learning, "that's your decision We want you to have a choice," Raimondo said, noting that distance learning come September will be better than it was in the spring.
   
 As the fall semester approaches, Facebook groups have emerged where parents and guardians float the possibility of "pod" learning for their kids should school buildings remain shuttered, or parents simply choose to not send their kids to school even if they do open for in-person learning.
   
 Pods, according to Desjardins, are "a way for families to have that social aspect of school, but keep it smaller and safer."
   
 "I've started a [Facebook] group and created a [Google] doc for the Portsmouth elementary school families to help better include everyone … The group is slowly growing, but I am finding many aren't ready to commit to anything just yet," Desjardins said in an email.
   
 One concern of premature pod formation is the potential for children in one pod to be grouped in separate classes, Desjardins said. "[And] the day is then spent logging into all different [Zoom] sessions!! Ideally the district allows us to form our 'plan b pods' and work with us to ensure they have the same teacher. There is a lot that goes into forming a pod, and leaving it up to the 24 or so possible families in a class really narrows down the possible 'matches.'"
   
 "I've also asked my school district to consider grouping the younger classes based more on neighborhoods for this year of chaos (which I realize isn't ideal long term for many reasons ... I do want to raise compassionate, inclusive and accepting individuals!)," Desjardins added in an email. "My kids are mostly only playing with neighbors right now, so this 'neighborhood classroom' would help limit our exposure."
   
 "We have about 20% of families that have opted for full distance learning right now," Portsmouth Superintendent Thomas Kenworthy said in an email on Aug. 19. "We are not requiring a final commitment until after the Governor announces the decision on a return scenario, so that number may change a bit. If families select full distance learning as their final decision we are asking for a commitment of one full marking period."
   
 With pod-style learning, there's much to consider. Some people Desjardins spoke to don't want to hire anybody to help with their childrens' schooling while others suggested having tutors for one to two hours a day to help answer questions.
   
 "I worry about not finding a [part-time] tutor the longer I wait," Desjardins said in an email.
   
 If it comes down to pod-style learning, "I'm not homeschooling," Desjardins said. "I want to use what the district is pushing out."
   
 "I am aware of pod conversations taking place in many communities," Kenworthy said. "We would be providing the instruction in a full distance learning scenario and the means to access the curriculum but we would not be able to guarantee anything beyond that. No parents have reached out to me about anything related to that topic."
   
 What about insurance and liability, if children are gathering in homes and potentially rotating? "People are asking about that," Desjardins said. It's another nebulous factor parents and guardians must consider.
   
 In an email on Aug. 19, Newport Superintendent Colleen Burns Jermain said 585 students had elected to do their schooling via distance learning, thus far.
   
 "They can do the first 60 instructional days (until Dec.1), a full semester or the full year. They can reconsider to return after Dec. 1 or a full semester. We will send notices out October 31 to see if any families wish to change," Jermain said. "We are requesting all families who are undecided to opt for in person at school and they can opt out for [distance learning] at any time.
   
 "Logistically it is easier for us to pull a desk out of a room and stay socially distant, follow [Rhode Island Department of Health] guidelines and keep it safe at all times."
   
 On Aug. 20, Middletown Superintendent Rosemarie Kraeger said about 400 students had opted for distance learning to that point. "[We] ask that they commit to a semester," Kraeger said.
