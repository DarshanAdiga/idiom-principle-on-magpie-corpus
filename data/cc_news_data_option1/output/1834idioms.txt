We don't know what will and won't be available in the upcoming weeks. But for the time being all we can do is wait, and eat.

Cars and vans decked out in balloons, posters and streamers, with honking horns and calls of “Congratulations,” all slowly drove by her home, as her family watched and cheered along.
 Friends had left dozens of pink flamingos in her front yard, and chalk art on the street and sidewalk celebrated her achievement.
 “When you go from being a stay-at-home mom to being a full-time student, you’re still home, but a lot of your time there has to be designated for school,” Page said.
 “And that’s something everybody (in the family) has to be on board with. Sometimes they understand, and sometimes they don’t, but they’ve been really good to help me through.”
 Her husband, Steve, who is the band and choir teacher at Heath Middle School, said he had doubts about her returning to school.
 “When she first told me, I thought she’d make a great nurse,” he said, “but I didn’t really see how full-time school was going to work.”
 The road to nursing took several turns. Page, a graduate of Paducah Tilghman High School, went to Transylvania University after high school and majored in music, graduating with a bachelor of arts degree.
 After earning her bachelor’s degree, she worked in the admissions office at Transylvania for a couple of years until she and her husband had their first child, Grainger.
 “Then I stayed home and that was my job for the next 17 years,” she said laughing. “And here we are.”
 Page decided to return to school after her youngest, Sonny, was born. When she was young, she always thought about being in the medical field.

In June, non-essential shop workers could be back at work, while hairdressers, gym instructors and bar staff will have to wait. Some children will be back to school, starting with primary children in reception, year one and year six, while others will not.
 There will be divisions across the nations and divisions across different age groups. There will perhaps be different lockdown measures put in place across towns or regions as the government tries to manage outbreaks.
 All of it is conditional on the R rate and on the level of new cases.
 And there are so many practical questions about lifting this lockdown. The first ministers of Scotland and Wales raised an obvious one this weekend.
 Nicola Sturgeon doesn't want to change the "stay at home" message and will certainly not be sending Scottish kids back to school from 1 June.
 Senior ministers are exasperated at what they see as Ms Sturgeon's attempt to raise her profile to that of the prime minister's and re-cast Mr Johnson as the ruler of England rather than the entire Union.

An Iranian warship was accidentally hit by a missile during exercises in the Gulf of Oman, killing at least one, state television said Monday, amid tensions with the US in the waterway.
 The friendly fire incident involving the Konarak vessel occurred on Sunday afternoon near Bandar-e Jask, off the southern coast of the Islamic republic, it said on its website.
 One report said the vessel had sunk after being hit by a missile fired by another Iranian warship.
 "The vessel was hit after moving a practice target to its destination and not creating enough distance between itself and the target," state television said on its website.
 Iran's army confirmed the death of one sailor, saying in a statement that "investigations" were continuing regarding the cause of the incident.
 The Konarak is a light logistical support vessel made in the Netherlands and purchased by Iran before the 1979 Islamic revolution.
 Weighing 447 tonnes and 47 metres (154 feet) long, the Hendijan-class vessel is equipped with four cruise missiles, according to state television.
 It was not immediately clear how many crew members were on board the warship at the time of the accident.
 Iran and its arch enemy the United States have traded barbs in the past year over a spate of incidents involving their forces in the sensitive Gulf waters.
 Tensions have escalated since 2018 when the US withdrew from a multinational accord that froze Iran's nuclear programme and reimposed crippling sanctions on its economy.
 Tasnim news agency said in an English-language tweet that the Konarak had sunk after being hit by the missile fired by another Iranian warship.
 "Konarak was 'sunk by friendly fire' after Moudge-class frigate 'Jamaran' accidentally shot (it) with a missile during live firing exercise in Jask area of #PersianGulf waters on 10th May."
 Tasnim did not mention the detail in its Persian-language report on its website.
 Iran's armed forces in January mistakingly shot down a Kiev-bound Boeing 737 passenger jet shortly after takeoff from Tehran, killing all 176 people aboard.
 The military admitted to the catastrophic error, saying it came as Iran's air defences were on high alert after firing a barrage of missiles at US troops stationed in Iraq.
 Iran launched the missiles in retaliation for the United States' killing of its top general Qasem Soleimani in a drone strike days before that.

Let's take a moment and talk about Zoom meetings, Microsoft Teams, FaceTime, and an app called "House Party." These are all virtual ways to connect with one another via the World Wide Web. Since we are all spending less time in a face-to-face setting, to satisfy our need for visual social interactions these vehicles have become extremely popular. My wife does a Zoom Meeting with her siblings weekly, my boss has us gather with one another to meet via Microsoft Teams, my grandkids FaceTime with us regularly, and then there's "House Party." This is the same premise as the others, but allows you to know when your "friends" are active and you can join them in real time to talk individually, or as a group. I'm to understand that people use this, and the other means mentioned, to have "virtual" happy hours. This has taken the place of gathering at your favorite watering hole, people's homes, and an array of other places that we gathered in the past.

Linebacker Morice Blackwell pulled a recruiting surprise on Mother’s Day, but it turns out he had a plan in place all along. The Arlington Martin standout decided a few days ago that he’d be making a commitment to the University of Texas, but he waited on Sunday to make the announcement as a way of thanking his mother. The big news went over well.
 “It was for my mom. I decided to go ahead and commit and make her happy. She’s so happy she dropped some tears of joy,” Blackwell said.  
 The 6-1, 195-pound Blackwell said he’d had a plan for about a week to go forward with his commitment. After talking to people he trusts, he said everything just felt right.  
 “I decided about a week now. I talked to my family, prayed about it. I talked to coaches, my pastor, my head coach to make sure it was the right move. Then I committed,” Blackwell said. “I felt like I belong at Texas. I felt like that was the move for me.”

Blackwell actually told the Texas coaches late last week. The staff was fired up, he said, and Blackwell said it feels great to have the process behind him.
 “I feel good, actually. It feels like it’s a big weight off my shoulders,” Blackwell said. “I have a home that I can go to. I can focus more on my team more, the Martin Warriors.
 Blackwell also considered Baylor and Arkansas, but said he ultimately settled on Texas due to the Longhorns’ combination of academic reputation and football history.
 “It’s the academic part, and the faithfulness they have in the team,” Blackwell said. “It’s the culture really. If you go to Texas, you’re going to be known as a good player and a dude that has a great mindset on and off the field.”
 Blackwell said he’s now “shutting it down” when it comes to recruiting, and his focus will be on improving his game and finishing his high school career on a high note. Last year, Blackwell finished with 128 total tackles … gaudy numbers and impressive productivity, but Blackwell said it’s his effort that really stands out.
 “I want to improve on holding people in open space, holding down good wide receivers. I just need to work on my footwork,” Blackwell said. “Texas is going to get someone that’s a dog, that is a go-getter that’s going to give 110 percent. I’m going to give my all no matter what.”

Boris Johnson's statement marked a shift in messaging rather than actual policy.
 This is a government that having ordered us into lockdown is now beginning to give us all a little bit more space to read between the lines about how we might choose to live with COVID-19.
 The actual changes were pretty modest.
 From Wednesday, people will be able to go out as much as they want. They will be able to exercise, go to the beach, sit in the park and sunbathe with one other person - two metres apart - or play golf, tennis or go for a swim in the sea.
 And he has also asked those who are unable to work from home - those in construction or manufacturing - to actively try to go back to work.
 In the round, these tweaks give far more scope for people to start working again and socialising again - albeit in limited ways.
 Tennis teachers can start up lessons again and golf clubs can reopen. Friends can meet in the park and children can perhaps have a (socially distanced) kick about with a friend.
 Different people will take different decisions based on their own appetite for risk, but as we move along this curve, different things will be asked of different groups of people too.

But when we meet Nico, he has already been in the city long enough for his visa to expire, his money to run out and for doubts about the future to start to take root. The film’s start date, pushed back several times, has taken on a mirage quality, insubstantial but tantalisingly still on the horizon. The jobs and side hustles that keep Nico solvent are just about bearable while he can still see himself with a work visa and a film career somewhere in the future. But when the film collapses once and for all, he can no longer comfortably tell himself he’s an actor filling the time between jobs with bar work, cleaning, childcare and a sideline in shoplifting. Having previously wafted away the offer of payment for looking after the baby of a well-heeled friend from Argentina, there comes a moment when his pride crumbles and he accepts the roll of notes offered by her husband. It stings, this readjustment in status from peer to hired help. The camera lingers on Pfening’s face long enough to catch an involuntary wince that he hides from the couple.

New Zealand will phase out its coronavirus lockdown over the next 10 days after successfully containing the virus, although some restrictions will remain, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced Monday.
 Ardern said that from Thursday shopping malls, restaurants, cinemas and playgrounds will reopen -- with the country moving to Level Two on its four- tier system.
 The 39-year-old leader warned "none of us can assume COVID is not with us" but said New Zealand currently had only 90 active cases after a seven-week lockdown.
 "Your efforts New Zealand have got us to this place ahead of most of the world and without the carnage that COVID has inflicted in many other places," she said in a televised address.
 "But there are risks ahead, so please be vigilant."
 New Zealand, with a population of five million has recorded 1,147 coronavirus cases, including 21 deaths.
 The number of new cases has been in single digits since mid-April, with three new infections recorded on Monday.
 Under Level Two restrictions, international borders remain closed but life domestically will return to something approaching normality.
 While social distancing must still be followed, the advice that people isolate themselves at home and "stick to your bubble" will no longer apply.
 "This is a transition out of our bubbles, you can see people you haven't seen in a while, you just can't do it all at once," Ardern said.
 "At Level Two we are out and about again, just about all parts of the economy are opening up again."
 The lockdown was first eased two weeks ago, allowing food takeaways and resumption of some recreational activities, but the freedoms granted by the latest relaxation will be far greater.
 Those aged over 70 will be allowed out again after more than seven weeks of mandatory quarantine.
 Domestic travel will be allowed, providing a boost to the crippled tourism industry and schools will fully reopen next Monday.
 Bars will not be back in business until May 21, giving them extra time to ensure they can keep patrons properly separated.
 Team sport will also return, with planning already underway to start a domestic version of Super Rugby on June 13 involving the competition's five New Zealand-based teams.
 Ardern said the move to Level Two would be reassessed after two weeks, with further easing possible depending on developments.
