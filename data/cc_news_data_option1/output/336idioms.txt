But, like in every fairy tale, India began to lose the plot of its growth story. According to a report by a financial agency, the collapse of the non- banking financial sector, the bursting of the real estate bubble, short- sighted policies and knee jerk reactions of the government, almost zero industrial growth, and lack of consumer demand are some of the macro reasons for the current slowdown. The much-touted fight against unaccounted money, euphemistically called ‘black money’, resulted in demonetisation, which set back the cash economy that fuelled agriculture and small and medium industry and business. The introduction of the GST reaffirmed the government’s resolve to bring in a nation-wide uniform tax structure but hiccups in implementation need to be taken care of.

ST. LOUIS - Tomas Hertl scored the winning goal — his fifth goal of the night — as the Pacific Division defeated the Atlantic Division 5-4 to win the NHL all-star game's 3-on-3 tournament on Saturday.
 David Pastrnak of the Boston Bruins took home the most valuable player award. The league's leading goal-scorer had a goal and an assist in the final for the Atlantic Division, after recording four points (three goals, one assist) in his squad's semifinal victory.
 The Pacific team featured Matthew Tkachuk of the Calgary Flames, and Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl of the Edmonton Oilers — members of two teams that have been embroiled in a war of words over the last two weeks.
 The Oilers and Flames have been at odds after Tkachuk levelled Zack Kassian with two huge hits during a game on Jan. 11 in Calgary. Kassian eventually had enough and mauled Calgary's winger/chief antagonist to earn himself a two-game suspension.
 Edmonton and Calgary will renew regular-season hostilities Wednesday and then again three nights later.
 The fifth straight year the NHL has used the 3-on-3 tournament format for its all-star game, Saturday opened with the Atlantic Division downing the Metropolitan Division 9-5 before the Pacific topped the Central 10-5 to set up the final.
 The Pacific took the all-star crown in both 2016 and 2018, while the Metropolitan captured the title in 2017 and again last year.
 With the victory, members of the winning squad earned a combined US$1-million prize at the home of the defending Stanley Cup champions.
 Five-time Grammy award-winning rock band Green Day kicked things off with a concert outside Enterprise Center, and then performed inside the venue before the final.
 St. Louis also hosted the all-star game in 1970 and 1988.
 ANDERSEN'S CONNECTION TO WOMEN'S GAME
 The NHL and its all-stars were overwhelmingly supportive of the 20 female players that took part in a 3-on-3 game during Friday's skills competition. But for Toronto Maple Leafs goalie Frederik Andersen, whether or not the NHL gets involved the same way the NBA did with the WNBA hits close to home because his sister Amalia plays in the NCAA at the University of Maine. "I don't know what the right answer is, the right solution is," said the netminder. "Of course I want see a (league) for young girls to dream of playing in. I know first-hand with my sister, she goes to college, and after that I don't really know what's in the future. It's just important we keep trying to grow it and hopefully something down the road can come up and they can have something to strive for besides playing college."

Due to low literacy rate our illiterate people can contribute very little in the economic and social development of the country. Because, the major contributions in those areas are made through education. Let suppose, there are many areas in Pakistan where students are facing problems in pursuing higher education. Gilgit-Baltistan is one of them. I am proud of the fact that in spite of the educational deprivations, inhabitant people are “jack of all trades” and as well as students having extraordinary and genuine talent. Moreover, to polish these young talents from Gilgit-Baltistan the central government should take initiatives and build various institutions which could meet the abilities of the students in their door step and it could fulfill the deprivations of lower class students.

Some 1,243 people were injured, with 34 of them in intensive care but not in critical condition, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said.
 On Saturday afternoon, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited the hardest-hit areas and attended the funeral of a mother and son killed in the quake. He warned people against repeating "negative" hearsay about the country being unprepared for earthquakes.
 "Do not listen to rumors, do not listen to anyone's negative, contrary propaganda, and know that we are your servants," Erdogan said.
 Various earthquake monitoring centers gave magnitudes ranging from 6.5 to 6.8. for the earthquake, which hit Friday at 8:55 p.m. near the Elazig province town of Sivrice, the Turkish Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) said.
 It was followed by 398 aftershocks, the strongest of them with magnitudes 5.4 and 5.1, the disaster agency said.
 Emergency workers and security forces distributed tents, beds and blankets as overnight temperatures dropped below freezing in the affected areas. Mosques, schools, sports halls and student dormitories were opened for hundreds who left their homes after the quake.
 "The earthquake was very severe. We desperately ran out (of our home)," Emre Gocer told the state-run Anadolu news agency as he sheltered with his family at a sports hall in Sivrice. "We don't have a safe place to stay right now."
 While visiting Sivrice and the city of Elazig, the provincial capital located some 565 kilometers (350 miles) east of Ankara, Erdogan promised state support for those affected by the disaster.
 "We will not leave anyone in the open," the Turkish leader.
 Earlier, a prosecutor in the capital Ankara announced an investigation into "provocative" social media posts. The Anadolu news agency reported that Turkey's broadcasting authority was also reviewing media coverage of the quake.
 At least five buildings in Sivrice and 25 in Malatya province were destroyed in the disaster, Environment and Urbanization Minister Murat Kurum said. Hundreds of other structures were damaged and made unsafe.
 AFAD reported that 42 people had been rescued as search teams combed wrecked apartment buildings.
 Television footage showed emergency workers removing a woman from the wreckage of a collapsed building 19 hours after the main earthquake struck.
 A prison in Adiyaman, 110 kilometers (70 miles) southwest of the epicenter, was evacuated due to damage its more than 800 prisoners transferred to nearby jails.
 AFAD said 28 rescue teams had been working around the clock. More than 2,600 personnel from 39 of Turkey's 81 provinces were sent to the disaster site. Unmanned drones were used to survey damaged neighborhoods and coordinate rescue efforts.
 "Our biggest hope is that the death toll does not rise," Parliament Speaker Mustafa Sentop said.
 Communication companies announced free telephone and internet services for residents in the quake-hit region.
 United Nation's Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is "deeply saddened by the loss of life and destruction of property in the wake of an earthquake in Elazig province, Turkey," according to a statement from his spokesman, Stephane Dujarric.
 Neighboring Greece, which is at odds with Turkey over maritime boundaries and gas exploration rights, offered to send rescue crews to assist the Turkish teams.
 Erdogan appeared to reject the offer of outside assistance during his visit to the city of Elazig, telling reporters, "Our state does not need anything."
 Turkey sits on top of two major fault lines and earthquakes are frequent. Two strong earthquakes struck northwest Turkey in 1999, killing around 18,000 people.
 A magnitude 6.0 earthquake killed 51 people in Elazig in 2010.

Coach Todd Sturgeon had no complaints about the first half, but the Highlanders had a few rushed possessions that opened the door for Madison in the fourth quarter. He wasn’t shocked the 10-3 Cubs were capable of mourning a rally.
 "They have a really good offensive team. A team that can shoot and score like they can, is never out of the game,” Sturgeon said. "The psychology of the game changes. They’re down 15 points so now they’re shooting free and easy and on defense, they’re running around taking chances, so you’re going to get open shots. They’re saying ‘our only chance is for you to shoot quick and miss.’ And we did that some.”
 But the Highlanders’ strong shooting was enough.
 The Highlanders were knocking down shots early and often, a welcome sight for Sturgeon after his squad shot 33 percent overall and 50 percent at the free- throw line Friday night when it held off Jennings County in overtime.
 In Saturday’s win, Floyd Central hit nine 3-pointers and Burks’ led the way as Floyd made 12 for 14 at the free-throw line.
 "He stepped right up and knocked those in,” Sturgeon said. "Last night, we missed the front end of three one-and-ones. So Seth stepping up is big. He’s had a lot of positive energy and has kept a positive attitude when he was struggling. It was good to see him get rewarded for that.”
 Heidbreder had the entire offensive arsenal working in the first half, hitting three of his four 3-pointers.

This upcoming Tuesday, the Ottawa County Board of Commissioners will vote on a resolution of support to continue the process of resettling refugees here in Ottawa County.
 Over the past few weeks, many Holland and Ottawa County residents have reached out to myself and my fellow commissioners by phone or email regarding this vote. Many have also come to speak directly to us at public comment. Their remarks, in whichever form, have been a strong reminder of the love and heartfelt concern that Ottawa residents have for their community.
 The issue of refugee resettlement for me revolves around a very simple equation: the dynamic community we have here in Holland and Ottawa has demonstrated almost from the beginning its ability to bring in people from outside, whether from down the road or from around the world, and have them grow and prosper and how these selfsame people can in turn bless those already here to learn and grow, humanly, spiritually, and economically.
 It is for that reason, the idea that our county and its future is not ours alone but one that we can and should share, is why I will be voting yes next Tuesday on the resolution to support refugee resettlement here in Ottawa County.

URBANA, Ill. (AP) — If you think walking into a legal marijuana dispensary in Illinois is like walking into your local head shop, think again. You're not welcomed by that unmistakable aroma and giant piles of kush at every turn. Instead, the smell of air freshener hits you as you're greeted by a friendly teller in a polo shirt seated behind a glass divider. In the corner of the lobby, there's a small orange couch and periodicals to thumb through while you wait. No one is on edge, and you don't have to watch what you say. Everyone knows exactly why you're there and is eager to help you have a pleasant transaction. If it weren't for the branding on the back wall and my knowledge of what was behind the security door, I would have thought I made a wrong turn and ended up at a credit union. Welcome to NuMed Urbana, the closest legal recreational marijuana dispensary to Indianapolis. In the past two months, the status of legal marijuana in the Midwest has gone from high and dry to just, well, high. In December, Michigan became the first state in the Midwest and the 10th in the nation to begin legal recreational marijuana sales. Illinois rang in the new year by kicking off its own sales of legal recreational marijuana on Jan. 1. While both states have had medical marijuana for years, making adult recreational marijuana all good in the eyes of the law has created a scenario where Hoosiers can buy legally if they’re willing to spend a couple hours on the interstate. Hoosiers seem to have already completed a few road trips. \"Some of our earliest visitors were from Indiana,\" said Sean Johnson, a manager at NuMed Urbana, which first opened as a medical marijuana facility in fall 2016 before adding recreational products this year. \"It's pretty common.

The case of Citizens United revolved around state efforts to ban a conservative nonprofit group from showing a critical documentary it produced of then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton right before the 2008 Democratic primary elections. At the time, the McCain-Feingold Act made it illegal for corporations and labor unions to engage in "electioneering communication" one month before a primary or two months before the general election.
 Or, in other words, the law, written by politicians who function without restrictions on speech -- and applauded by much of a mass media that functions without restrictions on speech -- prohibited Americans from pooling their resources and engaging in the most vital form of expression at the most important time, in the days leading up to an election.
 "By taking the right to speak from some and giving it to others," Justice Anthony Kennedy would write for the majority, "the Government deprives the disadvantaged person or class of the right to use speech to strive to establish worth, standing, and respect for the speaker's voice."
 Right after the decision, President Barack Obama famously rebuked the Justices during his State of the Union for upholding the First Amendment, arguing that the Supreme Court had "reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests -- including foreign corporations -- to spend without limit in our elections."
 Not a word of what he said was true.
 First of all, the court hadn't overturned a century of law (though the age of the law bears absolutely no relevance to its constitutionality). Citizens United reversed portions of a law, less than a decade old, that forbade Americans from contributing as much as they wanted directly to the funding of speech. Corporations would still be banned from donating directly to candidates, as they had been since 1907.
 Moreover, those corporations, typically unwilling to pick partisan sides for reasons of self-preservation, are still responsible for only a fraction of all political spending, averaging around 1% or less since 2010. Top 200 corporations spend almost nothing on campaigns.
 Conversely, since 2010, there's been an explosion in grassroots political activism on both right and left. As Bradley A. Smith points out in The Wall Street Journal, small-dollar donors are more in demand than ever. Bernie Sanders lives on them, and Donald Trump raised more money from donors who gave less than $200 than any candidate in history.
 Nothing in Citizens United, of course, made it legal for foreigners to participate in American elections. It is still illegal for anyone running for office to solicit, accept or receive help from foreign nationals.
 Obama, like many progressives, would ratchet up the scaremongering over anonymous political speech. Over the past couple of decades, our political class has convinced large swaths of the electorate that private citizens have a civic responsibility to publicly attach their names to every political donation. They do not. As the often-cited 1995 Supreme Court ruling in McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission says: "Anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority."
 It is true, though, that since the Citizens United decision, streaming services have been able to produce and play documentaries about political candidates like Trump without answering to a government entity. Publishing companies, especially smaller ones, can now print books about political figures without being policed by the state. And you can contribute as much money you want to any independent group that shares your values. As it should be. The very notion that anyone should be restricted from airing his or her views is fundamentally un-American.
 Then again, even if the floodgates had opened for "special interests" -- a euphemism for causes that Democrats dislike -- and even if there had been a massive spike in corporate spending on speech, and even if secretive corporate entities started producing documentaries that disparaged favored political candidates and released them days before an election, it still wouldn't matter.
 The principle of free expression isn't contingent on correct outcomes, it is a free-standing, inherent right protected by the Constitution. That principle holds whether people of free will are too lazy or too gullible to resist alleged misinformation. The proper way to push back against rhetoric you don't like is to rebut it.
 Or not. It should be up to you.

But wait a minute. What is that thing that is hindering you today? Is it fear of man or your friends are the ones keeping you back from having an encounter with the Saviour? Or do you have a covenant with the occultic people and as a result of that agreement you are being barred from coming to Jesus? Forget about that: it should not trouble you because all those covenants with evil power cannot save you when danger comes knocking at your door. That is why you would need Jesus because when all else fails and when it matters most He will come and save the day.

Marine radar is of importance for safety at sea and at the shore. The OOW of a vessel need to guide captains to be able to navigate when there is no visibility, or to be able to maneuver within feet in extreme conditions. In marine settings, radars are rarely used alone. In commercial vessels, they are integrated in an array of marine instruments including chart plotters, two-way marine radio, sonar, satellite navigation receivers such as Global Positioning System, and emergency locators. The integration of radar with other marine instruments is important at it is cumbersome to look at a few display screens. Therefore, displays can often cover plot charters, sonar, and radar into a single system. With digital frameworks, in the last years, marine instruments have advanced greatly. For example, the new marine instruments have 3D displays that enable navigators to view above, below, and all around the ship.

 GREENSBORO -- Area residents can weigh in on what transportation projects they want to see in the N.C. Department of Transportation's plan for 2023 to 2032.
 With a goal of increasing safety, reducing congestion and promoting economic growth, NCDOT uses data and local input to determine which projects get funded in the 10-year plan based on a specific formula created by the Strategic Transportation Investments law.
 A statewide 30-day public comment period on potential projects in Alamance, Caswell, Guilford, Orange and Rockingham counties runs Monday, Jan. 27, through Friday, Feb. 28. Projects can be as large as an interstate improvement or as small as a new turn lane or intersection improvement, and can be for any mode of transportation -- highway, aviation, bicycle, pedestrian, ferry, public transportation and rail.
 The comment period is not for maintenance-related projects, such as patching potholes, resurfacing or ditches. NCDOT uses a different method to prioritize those.
 The public can make suggestions in a short, interactive survey on the State Transportation Improvement Program website.
 The public also can submit project ideas and talk with NCDOT staff at an open house during regular business hours Feb 10-12 at NCDOT Division 7 headquarters, 1584 Yanceyville St., Greensboro.
 Residents also can contact Stephen Robinson of the Division 7 office at sjrobinson@ncdot.gov, at the office, or at 336-487-0000.
 Project scores and a draft project list will be released by March 2021. Another public comment period will follow in spring 2021, with the same process taking place for division-level projects in fall 2021.
 The 2023-2032 draft STIP will be released in February 2022 after Board of Transportation approval. Projects scheduled in the first six years are considered committed, while projects in the final four years will be re- evaluated as part of the next STIP development process.

BEIJING - The new virus accelerated its spread in China with 56 deaths so far, and the U.S. Consulate in the epicenter of the outbreak, the central city of Wuhan, announced Sunday it will evacuate its personnel and some private citizens aboard a charter flight.
 Chinese President Xi Jinping called the outbreak a grave situation, and the government stepped up efforts to restrict travel and public gatherings while rushing medical staff and supplies to Wuhan, which remains on lockdown.
 The latest figures reported Sunday morning cover the previous 24 hours and mark an increase of 15 deaths and 688 cases for a total of 1,975 infections.
 The government also reported five cases in Hong Kong, two in Macao and three in Taiwan. Small numbers of cases have been found in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, the U.S., Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Nepal, France and Australia.
 Canada said it discovered its first case, the man is his 50s who recently flew from Wuhan to Guangzhou, China, and then on to Toronto.
 A notice from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing said there would be limited capacity to transport U.S. citizens on the Tuesday flight from Wuhan that will proceed directly to San Francisco. It said that in the event there are not enough seats, priority will be given to to individuals “at greater risk from coronavirus."
 French automaker PSA Group said it will evacuate its employees from Wuhan, quarantine them and then bring them to France. The Foreign Ministry said it was working on "eventual options" to evacuate French citizens from Wuhan “who want to leave.” It didn't elaborate.
 Also Sunday, two of Hong Kong's biggest attractions, Hong Kong Disneyland and Ocean Park, announced they were closing for the time being.
 “As a precautionary measure in line with prevention efforts taking place across Hong Kong, we are temporarily closing Hong Kong Disneyland park out of consideration for the health and safety of our guests and cast members," the park said in a statement. It said a reopening date would be announced based on the advisement of local authorities.
 Travel agencies have been told to halt all group tours, and concern is growing over the potential impact of millions of people travelling back to the cities after the Lunar New Year holiday ends on Thursday. The vast majority of the infections and all the deaths have been in mainland China, but fresh cases are popping up.
 Singapore reported its fourth case on Sunday, a 36-year-old man from Wuhan. The Health Ministry said he did not exhibit any symptoms on his flight. He developed a cough the next day, sought treatment on Jan. 24 and was immediately isolated.
 South Korea confirmed its third case, according to Yonhap news agency.
 In the heart of the outbreak where 11 million residents are already on lockdown, Wuhan banned most vehicle use, including private cars, in downtown areas starting Sunday. The city will assign 6,000 taxis to neighbourhoods to help people get around if they need to.
 Wuhan plans to build a second makeshift hospital with about 1,000 beds to handle the growing number of patients. The city has said another hospital was expected to be completed Feb. 3.
 Medical workers in Wuhan have been among those infected and local media reported a doctor had died of the virus on Saturday morning. The 62-year-old physician worked at the ear, nose and throat department at Hubei Xinhua Hospital. He was hospitalized on Jan. 18 and died a week later.
 Xinhua also said medical supplies are being rushed to the city, including 14,000 protective suits, 110,000 pairs of gloves and masks and goggles.
 The National Health Commission said it is bringing in medical teams to help handle the outbreak, a day after videos circulating online showed throngs of frantic people in masks lined up for examinations and complaints that family members had been turned away at hospitals that were at capacity.
 The Chinese military dispatched 450 medical staff, some with experience in past outbreaks, including SARS and Ebola, who arrived in Wuhan late Friday to help treat many patients hospitalized with viral pneumonia, Xinhua reported.

I think I’m pretty smart, and I feel certain that you are, too. I read stuff and I try to pay attention to what’s going on in the world. When I see something on social media, I usually check it out before I share it, and when it comes time to elect new folks into office, I do a fair amount of due diligence towards understanding each candidate’s intentions and history so that I can be sure that I am picking the best representative for our community. You probably do the same, right?
 Each of us has spent a good part of our lives building our belief system based on what our parents, teachers, mentors, friends and chosen sources have told us we should believe. Regardless of where we each have landed or how many times our beliefs have changed, we didn’t get where we are this morning by falling off of a turnip truck and getting hit on one side of the head or the other. We’ve thought long and hard about our positions and we are certain that we have reached the best conclusion, and yet there is a very good chance that the person standing next to us feels differently and is just as certain in their own ideals.
 But how can we all be right, all at the same time?
 Honestly, we simply cannot and the best thing we can do for ourselves and our country is to accept the possibility that we might be wrong about points A, B or C in order to allow for the finesse it takes to truly make progress in our society. But that is so hard to do! We are living in difficult times, everything seems to be going wrong in one way or another, and the only sense of security we can muster is in feeling that what we believe is right is, in fact, right.
 The problem with this line of thinking is that it actually makes us more vulnerable than we realize. That security we feel in being “right” is the thing that allows us to fall prey to manipulation. If “they” know what we believe, they know exactly what we want to hear. And validating what we feel is exactly what turns us even deeper against each other.
 There was a great article circulating on social media this week that made this very clear. The piece titled “That Uplifting Tweet You Just Shared? A Russian Troll Sent It” was written by Darren Linvill and Patrick Warren, both experts in social media and propaganda. In it, they succinctly describe how internet trolls are not always easy to detect; sometimes they are playing to our perceived strengths in ways that are difficult to realize with the intent to promote a deepening rift.
 It’s enough to make you feel played like the proverbial $2 fiddle, isn’t it?
 The idea of “United we stand, divided we fall” is an age-old concept that dates back as far as Aesop of Greek legend, and it is just as true today as it ever was. The deeper we despise, the deeper we divide, and the weaker we become.
 In a previous column, I cited a fantastic TedTalk in which psychologist Jonathan Haidt lays out the critical balance that divergent political perspectives creates. His talk is titled “The moral roots of liberals and conservatives” and I encourage you to watch it. We literally need each other, to be able to bump against each other in productive ways in order to find answers. If we continue to allow ourselves to be driven to despise, we get nowhere but divided.
 While we are being distracted with finger-pointing and nail-biting distress over how “they” are ruining our country, the powers that be in Washington are busily working to promote their party’s agenda and it has very little to do with actually solving problems. It mostly involves raising dollars, and both sides of the aisle are equally guilty.
 In November, the Rome International Film Festival had the honor of premiering a film titled “Unrepresented,” a documentary feature film that presents a compelling look at corruption in Washington and the way it plays out across the board. The film was so enlightening and disconcerting to those in attendance that a second screening has been scheduled for this Thursday, Jan, 30, at 7 p.m. at the Rome City Auditorium.
 As described on the film’s website, “Democratic and Republican party leaders alike encourage us to believe that the political divide is wider than ever. In reality, the vast majority of Americans agree on basic reforms to outlaw the wanton political corruption from both parties, but politicians won’t pass them.
 ‘Unrepresented’ reveals the opportunities and challenges as committed public servants, nonpartisan activists, and everyday Americans build unprecedented movements to fix the broken system before it’s too late.”
 If you missed the first screening, I strongly encourage you to come and see this film that will shake you to the core as you begin to understand the way that the system works, mostly, against the good of the people. The screening is perfectly timed as we enter the race for what is already a highly contested Senate seat that has candidates coming out of the woodwork to represent our 14th district.
 The film includes an appearance by local attorney David Guldenschuh, who discusses his work in organizing states to enact an Article V movement to prompt a balancing of the national budget, something our elected representatives seem to struggle with accomplishing.
 I hope to see you there for this very eye-opening film. No matter which side of the aisle holds your alignment, let’s avoid being played against each other. We are better than $2 fiddles, so let’s start acting like it.

MELBOURNE -- Australia Day celebrations on Sunday saw thousands of people flock to beaches and music festivals, but festivities were clouded by the tragedy of bushfires which have killed 33 and destroyed hundreds of homes.
 Thousands also rallied in support of indigenous Australians who regard Australia Day, the day which marks the start of white settlement, as "Invasion Day."
 Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australia Day was a time to acknowledge the country's stories, both ancient and recent.
 "And, as we have been reminded especially in these most recent times, stories of drought, bushfires, adapting to the many challenges that come with living in this great continent," Morrison said in his Australia Day address.
 "But we would have it no other way as Australians because we love this land, its beauty and, yes, we know its terror, in all of its riches and all of its blessings, and we are a free, diverse and accepting people."
 Australia Day marks the anniversary of the 1788 arrival of the "First Fleet" of British ships at Sydney Cove. Britain claimed Australia, declaring it an empty land, but indigenous Australians trace their lineage back 50,000 years.
 Indigenous Australians want Australia Day abolished, but the prime minister has promised to defend the holiday's date.
 Australia's 700,000 or so indigenous people track near the bottom of its 25 million citizens in almost every economic and social indicator.
 Protesters rallied on Sunday carrying red, black and yellow indigenous flags and signs "No Pride in Genocide."
 "January 26 is a bad day, a hurtful day, but we come here for solidarity," Bundjalung elder Gwen Williams-Heckling told Australian Broadcasting Corp. "We need a new day because we can never celebrate the day of invasion."
 Fires across Australia's bushland have scorched an area nearly the size of Greece since early October, killing 33 people, including several firefighters and volunteers, and millions of animals.
 Morrison announced The National Emergency Medal will be awarded to emergency responders battling the 2019-20 bushfires.
 "The response to the bushfire situation has been unprecedented with thousands of volunteer and paid responders working around the clock, day and night, week after week to protect property and save lives," he said, acknowledging some firefighters were battling blazes on Australia Day.
 Rao Asim, a Pakistani who became an Australian citizen on Sunday with his wife Hina and their two children, said during the broadcast ceremony that his family had changed their plans on how to celebrate.
 "We had big (party) plans," he said. "But we have decided as a family to donate the money for the bushfires relief effort."

Local vendors can meet with brides and grooms more readily throughout the planning process, making things less stressful on the happy couple. This also makes it easier to drop off deposits, attend meetings, make fitting appointments, or attend styling sessions. Savings Couples who travel for their weddings and employ local vendors will not have to pack as much.
 Using local vendors eliminates the need to bring along bulky dresses, decorative items, flowers, and much more. Plus, couples needn’t pay to transport and house vendors brought along from back home. Environment Individuals who take great strides to conserve resources by reducing their energy consumption and protecting the environment often find that shopping local is beneficial.
 Local vendors are more likely to source their materials from other local businesses, reducing their carbon footprints along the way. For example, local caterers may rely on local farmers for their foods, affording couples the chance to host eco-friendly or even farm-to-table weddings.
 Working with local vendors often translates into getting more personalized service and attention than mass retailers or merchants can provide. Going local when choosing wedding vendors is an increasingly popular choice among couples about to tie the knot.

Preparation paid off for Garrett Green leading into the first PBR Canada Monster Energy Tour stop in Calgary this weekend.
 On just the second ride of the night to start the Calgary Classic on Friday, Green had a thrilling 86.5-point performance atop Dejango of Skori Bucking Bulls and the score held up as the best of the evening.
 "I've come here with a good mindset ready to start off the 2020 season with a bang," said the 27-year-old cowboy, who originally hails from Meeting Creek, Alta., and now lives in nearby Three Hills.
 Before making the 90-minute drive to Calgary for both rounds of the two-day event, Green woke up early on both Friday and Saturday to get ready.
 "I was making sure I was feeling healthy," said Green, who's a big proponent of getting himself in the best shape possible before his bull-riding expeditions. "I did a bunch of yoga in the morning to make sure I was feeling stretched out and limber and ready to go. I just try to be an athlete."
 And just what are the benefits of yoga for bull riders?
 "A guy needs to be kind of stretchy to be able to ride them bulls," explained Green, who scored 79 points on TNT (Wild Hoggs Bucking Bulls) on Saturday to advance to the championship round later that night. "They'll bend you every which way. The more you can bend without breaking the better."
 Although his training regimen isn't quite as intense as Green's, Dayton Johnston also made sure to prepare as best as possible before each day of the competition.
 "I hopped up this morning and hit the gym, just did a little run and stuff like that," said Johnston, 25, of Milk River, Alta. "Not too much. You can't go too hard on game day, get a little bit loosened up and stretch.
 "Everyone thinks that we're all just crazy and stupid cowboys, but you've got to be athletic. You've got to have really good balance. You have to know where to be on those bulls and how they move. You have to react."
 After scoring just 80 points atop Wilson Rodeo bull Hell's Bells on Friday, Johnston opted to take a re-ride in Round 1 on Friday and the move paid off as he posted a score of 86 on White Tie.
 "Eighty points was pretty much towards the bottom, so when they give you another chance and they give you a good bull like the one I had -- White Tie from Nansen Vold -- you've got to take advantage of those opportunities and I was able to capitalize," Johnston said. "It worked out for the best."
 He followed up his Round 1 performance with a 77.5-point ride on Saturday atop Off The Tracks of Wild Hoggs Bucking Bulls, which was enough to earn him a spot in the championship round.
 "I'd never seen him before," said Johnston, of the bull from Wild Hoggs Bucking Bulls. "I like not knowing what they do and you just go off the feel and react to him. It's a lot easier to set the gameplan. I mean, they're an animal. Their gameplan's not always the same. It's nice to not know what they normally do and just ride them jump for jump."
 Dakota Buttar, of Kindersley, Sask., scored 85.5 points on both Friday and Saturday nights to head into the short round as the top-ranked rider with 171 points, while fellow flatlander Aaron Roy, of Yellow Grass, Sask., went in as the second seed with a two-ride total of 167.5 points.
 Also qualifying for the finals were Zane Lambert, of Ponoka, Jared Parsonage, of Maple Creek, Sask., Calgary's Nick Tetz, Callum Miller, of Warwick, Australia, Wyatt Gleesson of Sundre, and Nick Goncalves of Oakville, Ont.
 Although Todd Chotowetz and Jack Gardner didn't qualify for the championship round, the pair both had strong performances on Saturday as they opted to take re-rides.
 Chotowetz, of Major, Sask., had Saturday's best score of 86 points atop Uncle Tim in his re-ride, while Gardner of Fort St. John, B.C., tied Buttar's score of 85.5 points after a thrilling ride on Mr. Legit.
 Gardner started out on Saturday with a 73.5-point ride atop Money Talks. He was then bucked off Throwin' Shade before being given another re-ride, which paid off with his strong performance atop Mr. Legit.

MADISON — Floyd Central junior Jake Heidbreder scored 19 of his 24 points in the first half and senior Seth Burks was 6 for 6 at the free-throw line in the final minute to hold off a Madison rally in boys’ high school basketball action Saturday night.
 The Highlanders, who led by as many as 16, prevailed 69-63 in Hoosier Hills Conference action, but the host Cubs had a shot to tie it after clawing their way back in the fourth quarter.
 Trailing just 62-59 after coming up with back-to-back stops, Madison’s Mason Welsh — who led the Cubs with 24 points — missed a tying 3-point attempt and the Highlanders secured the rebound. Burks drew fouls on back-to-back possession and came through at the line to help Floyd Central (11-3, 3-1 HHC) move into a tie for second place with Bedford North Lawrence.

For the ninth consecutive year, Missouri wrestling is a conference champion.
 The Tigers dominated Northern Illinois in a 32-6 win and capped off the afternoon with a 20-12 defeat of Cleveland State (7-3, 3-3 MAC) for a sweep of Mid-American conference opponents that clinched a share of the conference title. It’s Missouri’s eighth straight MAC title with a Big 12 tournament championship in 2012.
 Missouri (10-5, 7-0 MAC) wasted little time pulling ahead of the Huskies (8-4, 3-2 MAC). In the first two bouts of the afternoon, redshirt sophomores Cameron Valdiviez and Allan Hart pinned Northern Illinois wrestlers to put the Tigers up 12-0.
 “We kind of smacked them in the mouth a little bit and it definitely put a fire in our team,” sophomore Jarrett Jacques said.
 Missouri never looked back, with its only losses coming from Grant Leeth by one point in the 141-pound division against Anthony Gibson and an overtime loss in the heavyweight match, which gave Missouri a 26-point win over the Huskies.
 One of the most dramatic finishes of the doubleheader came from Dylan Wisman, who had a takedown of Brit Wilson at the buzzer for a major decision. Wilson only had one prior loss on the season and wrestled former Tiger Daniel Lewis for the MAC Championship last season.
 Wisman’s decision was a tone-setter for the rest of the afternoon. Coach Brian Smith said Wisman wrestled well after being banged up throughout the season.
 “It got to a point where he’s wanting to cut the guy and score takedowns and that’s awesome,” Smith said. “In a high-level match, he’s scoring and getting a major, which was big. It sends a message.“
 Three days after winning MAC West Wrestler of the week, sophomore Jarrett Jacques won both of his bouts to push his win total to a team-leading 21.
 “Even though his best stuff wasn’t there, he kept battling to score points,” Smith said. “That’s what our guys got to learn in those kind of matches.”

This month we have celebrated and honored the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. for all of his sacrifices and the wisdom he shared with us — for such a time as that in which he lived and for this in which we live. We celebrated him for the footprint of justice, faith and peace that he left on our world. He tried to point us the way with words and action only God could have poured into him. But most of all we remember him for his faith that should give us hope.
 Dr. King actually believed in what he spoke and lived. He said, “Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.” His faith was unwavering in the belief that humans have a part that is made of gold and that part is called the best self.
 It is apparent that there is a growing sense of fear and unease in our communities and the feeling is justified. What we must do is become more and more aware of our surroundings, especially in light of the individuals who were arrested in our area recently.
 This awareness should remind us of what Dr. King faced when the law was not on his side. He went to bed nightly knowing that the only force that stood between him and death was the hand of God. I wonder what he would think if he could see what is still going on in the world 52 years later. We live in a time when we must face truth about the degrading level some men will go to in order to remain in the position of power and control. We live in fierce and urgent times and the truth is blowing in the wind.
 Dr. King fought the forces of greed and white supremacy his entire life on earth, and now from the grave he continues to fight them through those who are left behind to continue the journey — because he left a spirit that cannot be killed.
 When there were those who said to him “Dr. King you must slow down,” he fought even harder with a sense of urgency. When he was in jail and received a request from his minister friends calling for a cooling off period, he was upset that they would even call for him to slow down. He had hoped that they would hold the concept that no man’s freedom should be held up because of his skin color. He basically said to them that it is not your freedom that you are fighting for it is mine, and therefore are you saying that it is alright for me to wait? He went on to say that injustice in one area is injustice everywhere.
 As long as Dr. King was dealing with dime store lunch counters and sitting in the front of the bus, that was okay. But when he started moving and demonstrating against the wars, and talking about increasing the wages of the garbage workers, that was stepping over into another arena ... dealing with the economy is tampering with the economic foundation of America.
 The mentality of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani has pervaded this country just below the surface from the beginning of its birth. If you research facts about what happened here in this city, county and state, you will uncover some dark truth about mysterious deaths and the disappearances of black boys and men.
 My friend Rose remembers when John F.’s only son, Hiram, was shot to death at the Depot by the police. There was no inquiry. During those days no one cared and no one understood. If a few did care, like Rose, the force was too powerful to go against. Rose saw this and did nothing, but what was she going to do? Run and tell it to the ones who did the whisking-away at midnight and get whisked away herself? The marginalized individuals were black and poor and no one understood. Knowing this fact, Dr. King continued to march and make his mark in spite of the prevailing threats of death.
 Dr. King’s message was — and would still be — for all people to remain calm and thoughtful. Blacks must learn to remain focused on learning to love ourselves individually and collectively. Dr. King stated, “I have decided to stick with love. Hate is too much of a burden.“
 We must not focus primarily on the white supremacy or the racism that is engulfing this country. When we do that, the problem looms greater. Every problem that we are facing in this city, county, state and country, Dr. King encountered during his lifetime. He made a decision that he would seek God for the solution.
 We must turn our minds to the solution. Our work must be focused on our creative beauty, which is key to our survival. As one of my friends said to me, “You people must get up off your behinds and work on solutions yourselves. That woe-is-me mentality is worn out.” One way to solve the problem is for all of us to look for the righteousness in each other. Along with righteousness will always come repentance.
 And let us continue to celebrate the MLK holiday because love was the guide by which King lived and because once lit it is an all-consuming-fire. Let us all work hard to keep the fire of love alive.
