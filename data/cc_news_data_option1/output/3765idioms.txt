Amidst tremendous strains on the economy due to COVID-19 pandemic when revenue inflow is under stress, the UT Government of Jammu and Kashmir has come out with an innovative decision to allocate Rs.1350 crore for revival of business sector that is hard hit due to the COVID pandemic. In addition to this, additional amount of Rs.1500 crore is earmarked for clearing accumulated liabilities comprising pending bills of different Government works, the payment of which in most of the cases, was withheld due to "cash crunch". However, needless to add, after proper verification and scrutinizing only such payments should be released. At the outset, this amount was going to accelerate dormant economic activities, generating demand for goods and services and impacting favourably supply chains which again was going to create additional opportunities for income earnings. All efforts are required to be pooled which aimed at reviving and generating employment opportunities since it hardly needs to be emphasised as to how much have jobs mostly in unorganised sector, got severally affected. In that connection, addressing a press conference, Lieutenant Governor announced Rs.950 crore package for setting up small and medium and big industrial units at a paltry rate of 5% for the first six months of current financial year. A separate package, it is learnt, was in the offing for transporters and houseboat owners as well.

THE PANDEMIC grinds on. A fraught new school year begins (sort of). Chilly weather brings ominous thoughts of how much more difficult it will be to keep distanced and stay safe. And hundreds of thousands in the Granite State struggle with maddeningly slow and unreliable internet service — if they can get it at all.
 They live in rural communities that are home to 40 percent of New Hampshire’s population. Unlike the other 60 percent, a high proportion cannot take for granted the lifeline that enables remote working, schooling and doctor appointments, links to far-flung family and friends, access to news and information and online shopping, and the respite of a movie.
 They’re people like M.J. Pettingill, a book author, graphic designer, musician and herbalist who lives in North Sandwich.
 “It got really bad in April,” she says. She called her internet company, a local wireless provider, to inquire. “I asked him, ‘Is it because of the pandemic — more people here?’ He said, ‘That’s definitely happening.’” Later, when her internet disappeared entirely, he did some troubleshooting and discovered a nearby baby monitor was interfering with her signal.
 “It was so insane!” Pettingill says. “For two weeks my life was torn apart because a neighbor had a baby monitor guarding against foxes in his chicken coop!”
 Switching to a Verizon Wireless hot spot wasn’t much better. Her iPhone had to be perched in just the right spot in her kitchen, and even that didn’t always work. And though she pays for “unlimited” service, she finds by mid-month Verizon throttles her speed to a crawl.
 But take heart, Ms. Pettingill and other sufferers. There are concrete reasons for hope.
 This summer Governor Chris Sununu offered $50 million to expand rural broadband-level internet service, drawing on federal pandemic relief funds. Unfortunately, the program has severe strictures — for instance, projects have to be finished by Dec. 15, an almost-impossible deadline. So relatively few towns or internet providers applied and only $14 million of the $50 million was awarded.
 Now, Senator Maggie Hassan is sponsoring a bill with bipartisan support that would extend the CARES Act funding deadline for a year. If it passes, that will enable the governor to reopen the purse strings.
 Another promising development is the dramatic turnaround by the New Hampshire Electric Cooperative. Last spring, the co-op’s board opposed a grassroots initiative to prod it into the broadband business. (At least 130 rural cooperatives are already into broadband, defined as at least 25 megabits-per- second download speed and 3 for uploads.)
 Two-thirds of voting co-op members were needed to approve the proposed bylaw change. The result fell just 183 votes shy of that goal. But the co-op board got the message and did a 180-degree turnabout. The utility now aims to provide broadband, at highly competitive rates, to all its members who lack it. The utility’s 85,000 members live in 115 New Hampshire towns.
 But there’s a snag. The co-op’s lawyers say a change in its bylaws is still needed to allow its member-elected board to own the infrastructure needed to string high-speed fiber-optic cable. The good news is that co-op members can come to the rescue. On Sept. 15 ballots were mailed in a special election to make the necessary changes. Significantly, those changes have unanimous board support. If two-thirds of the members casting ballots vote yes, the path will be cleared for the co-op’s broadband venture. Voting, which can be done online, closes on Oct. 14.
 “If the vote fails,” says board chair Tom Mongeon, “the co-op’s options would be limited in how we can support the expansion of broadband in our service area.”
 The co-op says revenue from its new venture has the potential to lower members’ electric rates. It could even reduce what non-members pay for their internet by injecting much-needed price competition.
 That’s not all. On Oct. 29 the Federal Communications Commission is holding a “reverse auction” to allocate $16.4 billion for rural broadband. Some $60 million of this is earmarked for New Hampshire.
 The co-op and other entities can apply for this money. Moreover, there’s growing support for additional federal subsidy for rural broadband. The pandemic is helping fuel this movement, since it reveals both the absolute necessity for fast, reliable internet and the painful inequities in current service.
 I just hope some of these developments can bear fruit in time to help M.J. Pettingill and many others like her. She’s so desperate she may have to put her idyllic five-acre farm, with its pond and five gardens, up for sale.
 “I really don’t want to leave, I love it here,” she told me. “But if stays the way it is now, I’ll need to do it.”
 And she won’t be the only one.

After almost 10 years as chairman of the town of Onalaska, Rolly Bogert has decided to turn his gavel over to someone else.
 Bogert submitted his resignation Aug. 24, effective immediately.
 Reflecting on his tenure, Bogert acknowledges his time as town chair has been noteworthy.
 “There were some interesting times, to say the least,” Bogert said. “When I ran (for the office), I thought I’d serve two, maybe three terms. It was almost five.”
 Shortly after taking the oath of office, Bogert quickly learned he needed to fill both the town clerk and secretary position when the two officers gave notice they were retiring.

The 2020-21 school year might be a month old, but Monday will have a "first day" feel as some students return to Henderson County classrooms for the first time since March 13.
   
 Students in kindergarten, first grade and second grade whose parents or guardians opted to return to in-person classes will step into school buildings this morning. Students will attend five days a week.
   
 Starting Thursday, grades 3-5 will begin coming back, but will be split into two groups based on last names. Group A will include students whose last names start with A-K, and Group B will include last names L-Z.
   
 Students in grades 6-12 will begin coming back Monday, Sept. 28 on the same split schedule.
   
 Group A will be in school on Mondays and Thursdays, and Group B on Tuesdays and Fridays, with Wednesdays left as virtual-only days for all students.
   
 Families also had the option to continue with virtual-only schooling for the rest of the semester.
   
 From 8 a.m. to noon, teachers will teach their in-person and virtual students at the same time
   
 For K-2 students, teachers will tend to in-person students in the afternoon, while certified tutors or teachers assistants will take over the virtual students.
   
 In the afternoon, virtual students in grades 3-12 will have fully remote materials, such as assignments in Google Classroom.
   
 The Plan B calendar goes through September and October, and the School Board will continually meet to look at the numbers and evaluate how it's going.
   
 The board voted to implement Plan B earlier this month, choosing a plan that splits in-person students into two groups who will attend classes on two alternating days per week, with Wednesdays left for virtual-only learning for all students.
   
 Safety measures
   
 Each school is required to provide social distancing markings and remind students to stay six feet apart, according to the state Department of Health and Human Services toolkit.
   
 Schools must limit the total number of students, teachers, staff and visitors within a building so that six feet of social distancing can be maintained.
   
 All students not eating, engaged in strenuous physical activity or claiming an exception must wear a face covering.
   
 The toolkit also explains other requirements, including symptom screening, temperature screenings, providing adequate cleaning supplies and putting hand sanitizer in every classroom, building entrance and cafeteria.
   
 Measures noted at the board meeting for Henderson County schools included temperature screening stations at school entrances for every visitor and school bus driver, sneeze guards at front desks, markings and signage for social distancing and masks available for anyone who needs them.

50 percent concession on power and water bills too has been announced but only for fixed demand charges pertaining to industrial units and commercial consumers and not anything of the sort for the common people. This measure of waiving of power dues would cost the public exchequer an amount of Rs.105 crore. The entrepreneurs engaged with industrial activities in the UT had been demanding such concessions and other facilities to help them tide over an emerged precarious situation where most of the units getting severely impacted were running the risk of even closure. Since the backbone of the economy of the UT of Jammu and Kashmir is tourism and tourism related activities , which have been worst hit , we have learnt, to provide support base and a succour to it is under active consideration of the Government and may be announced shortly. That would take care of even at individual micro levels like Shikarawalas, houseboat owners, traders engaged with tourism etc. It needs to be taken note of and appreciated as well that the package announced as under reference, was over and above the package of Rs. 1400 crore announced for Jammu and Kashmir under centrally sponsored Aatma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (ANBA) scheme. Revenues from the source of stamp duties too would be parted with to the tune of 100 percent for all types and classification of borrowers till ending March 2021.
