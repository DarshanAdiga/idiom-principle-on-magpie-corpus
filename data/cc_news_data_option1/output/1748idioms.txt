There are gluts of all shapes and kinds forming in the United States nowadays, a testament to the scope of the economic pain the coronavirus is inflicting. Slaughterhouses are killing and tossing out thousands of pigs a day, dairy farmers are pouring away milk, oil sellers were paying buyers recently to take barrels off their hands, and now, brand-new cars are being left adrift at sea for days.
 For the auto industry, the crisis has left cars gathering dust on dealer lots, dealerships shuttered, auction prices slipping and tens of thousands of workers laid off or furloughed. April U.S. sales plummeted 54 percent for Toyota Motor Corp., 47 percent for Subaru Corp. and 39 percent for Hyundai Motor Co.
 "Dealers aren’t really accepting cars and fleet sales are down because rental- car and fleet operators aren’t taking delivery either,” said John Felitto, a senior vice president for the U.S. unit of Norwegian shipping company Wallenius Wilhelmsen. "This is different from anything we’ve seen before. Everyone is full to the brim.”

La politica di oggi come quella degli ultimi 20/30 anni non pensa mai alle generazioni future, fa e ha fatto sempre finta, la politica non pensa ai bambini, ha fatto sempre finta, ne abbiamo le prove: guardate cosa succede agli edifici scolastici dopo ogni sacrosanto terremoto, anzi alcune voltee basta anche solo che sbatta una porta per far venire giù un controsoffitto. Altra grande prova della potenza degli esperti è insita nella loro mascolinità, non è una battuta,  in questi due mesi mai pensato a tutelare la maternità e il lavoro al femminile, entrambi messi a repentaglio senza alcuna possibilità di riscatto o di aiuto.
