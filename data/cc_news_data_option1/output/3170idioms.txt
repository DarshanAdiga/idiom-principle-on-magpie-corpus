 At its regular monthly meeting Monday evening (delayed from the normal 1st Monday of the month), the Clinton City Council also authorized payment of $93,748 for a contractor to landscape and beautify the grounds of the MS Bailey Municipal Center. The landscaping plan has been developed and submitted by consultants WK Dickson; the work will be financed by the hospitality and accommodations (tourism-promotion) tax money, the council was told.
 The City is going to buy and install a Christmas Lights Show, and landscaping work with seating was designed with this new feature in mind. People will be able to use the seating to eat their meals outdoors in the Uptown Clinton area, the council was told.
 The Council also approved on 2nd and final reading an ordinance to sell 53 acres at the Sterilite property and 2.5 acres at the former American Legion Hut (near Clinton Middle School). City Staff told the council that the final SC DHEC permit has been secured for the Hwy 56 land of the new City of Clinton Recreation Complex, allowing construction to begin. Council members also agreed to move forward with a Connectivity Study, possibly the first step in constructing bicycle lanes on city streets.

 # Rutherford County Schools director scolds teachers who caused quarantine
 Nancy DeGennaro
 Murfreesboro Daily News Journal
 Rutherford County Schools Board Director Bill Spurlock scolded teachers he said were not social distancing, causing faculty to quarantine and move students to distance learning at the beginning of the year.
 "These (cases) right here could easily have been avoided," Spurlock said at Tuesday night's board of education meeting. "We were not practicing social distancing ... and we've got evidence of that."
 Christiana Middle will start with distance learning for all students until Aug. 24 because two employees tested positive for COVID-19 and 10 others came in contact with them.
 There have also been potential coronavirus cases pertaining to faculty members at Smyrna Primary School and Buchanan Elementary.
 But with the start of the school year just two days away, it's full steam ahead for Rutherford County Schools.
 The Tennessee Department of Health reported 2,548 active COVID-19 cases in Rutherford County as of Monday, making the spread rate of .77%, the lowest it's been in 21 days, Director of Schools Bill Spurlock said at Tuesday's meeting.
 "We're not seeing any huge increases of cases within (ages) 5-18," Spurlock said. "Quite frankly, I think we're seeing some positive things."
 As a precautionary measure, Spurlock asked if the district could require testing of those who exhibit symptoms of the coronavirus.
 And while there is no required testing, the district is also not prohibited from asking faculty or staff to get tested for COVID-19 should they exhibit symptoms.
 Tennessee scientists have partnered on cutting-edge discoveries in a race against COVID-19  As virus rages worse than ever, Tennessee leaders forge ahead with reopening  Special session on coronavirus business protections not likely until August, GOP leader says  COVID or not, Tennessee expects 180 days of ‘quality instruction’ for students next year  Big changes are coming this fall to UT — where not wearing a mask is not an option
 "If we continue down the route of no test ... it won't take long for our entire faculty (and) staff to be out if we're not careful," Spurlock said. "Come Thursday, when the students show up, we're going to be on our game ... because I'm confident in what our principals and our teachers and staff are doing."
 "I've heard from quite a few teachers ... that were having some ... very serious problems rolling out Kiddom," Board member Lisa Moore said.
 Sullivan said an orientation overloaded Kiddom's server, causing issues but he assured the problems have been mitigated.
 The board also adopted a moratorium on state standardized testing that is being used for rankings or scoring. Supported by the Tennessee School Boards Association, the resolution requests the state consider holding districts harmless in light of the variety of challenges schools have faced during the coronavirus pandemic.

The presence of the agents from U.S .Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Marshals Service was intended to tamp down on the demonstrations but instead reinvigorated the Black Lives Matter movement.
 The U.S. agents began drawing down July 31 under an agreement between the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Democratic Gov. Kate Brown.
 But protests have continued nightly at different locations since then, with demonstrators calling for the City Council to defund the police and reinvest the money in the Black community.
 Police precincts in the north and east of the city, the police union headquarters and a building that houses police offices have been frequent targets. Officers made dozens of arrests last weekend and this week after clashes with demonstrators who police say have thrown eggs, bottles and rocks at officers; started fires and punctured the tires of police vehicles.

As the summer heated up and infection rates went down, Massachusetts got footloose before it was COVID free. And now the state could be on the verge of paying for it.
 Gov. Charlie Baker, in his most scolding tone yet, rolled back outdoor gathering size limits from 100 people to 50, and said he was giving state and local police the authority to enforce those limits on public and private property. Indoors limits will remain at 25.
 "Hugs, handshakes, high-fives, dancing, who knows?" Baker said last week about what's been going on at these backyard parties and events that the governor blames for an uptick in COVID-19 cases and a rise in the state's positive test rate to 2.1 percent.
 The virus might not be out of the barn yet, but it's getting close to the door. And Baker said people have no one to blame but themselves for getting lax about the distancing and mask-wearing precautions they took seriously for months in order to be able to leave their homes this summer.
 "The biggest issue we have is people who are familiar with people being familiar with them, in big groups," Baker said.
 That's not the only problem though. The governor said he's not ready, as some have suggested he should be, to step back a phase in the reopening schedule. But he said bars "masquerading" as restaurants by selling potato chips and pretzels in order to open need to stop what they're doing.
 The state getting serious about enforcement is all so Massachusetts can avoid a repeat of this spring and becoming the next kid in the New England neighborhood to not get invited to the pool party. That distinction went this week to Rhode Island, where Gov. Gina Raimondo is battling her state's own resurgence because of too much partying.
 The Ocean State found itself added to the quarantine lists of not just Massachusetts, but also states like New York and New Jersey who want Rhode Islanders to quarantine if they leave their waterfront enclave.
 This precursor to a fall resurgence couldn't come at a worse time as schools are finalizing their plans to bring students back to classrooms and campuses around the state, or not. Business confidence also slipped in July, according to Associated Industries of Massachusetts, and enhanced unemployment benefits from the federal government have expired, eliminating a safety net as the recovery appears to be slowing.
 UMass Amherst reversed its plans to welcome students back to campus this month even if all their classes were going to be taught online, and some districts like Somerville are ignoring the administration's pleas to at least give in- person learning a chance.
 The Legislature has employed a hydrid model of in-person and remote participation during the pandemic, but in what was supposed to be the first full week of a five-month recess there wasn't much of either going on.
 The House and Senate made sure to give their negotiators every second available before the faux midnight deadline to strike a deal on police reform, transportation spending, telehealth or economic development. They did this knowing they had already extended the session, giving themselves ample more time.
 Seven days later and the Legislature was in the same place it was the previous Friday night - waiting.
 "We will let the conferees do their magic and hopefully get something done and pass it," Senate President Karen Spilka said at the start of the week. "If it's done next week, two weeks, that's when we will come back to do it."
 Instead of shrinking, the number of conference committees actually grew with a fifth piece of legislation dealing with climate change moving into talks between the branches.
 Sen. Michael Barrett and Rep. Thomas Golden, the co-chair of the Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy, are leading those talks, with support from Senate Majority Leader Cynthia Creem, Speaker Pro Tempore Patricia Haddad, House Minority Leader Brad Jones and Sen. Patrick O'Connor.
 It's the same group that negotiated a significant renewable energy bill two years ago, minus Sen. Marc Pacheco, who still chairs the Senate's Global Warming Committee, but has fallen out of the new leadership hierarchy and was replaced by Creem.
 Instead, Pacheco was relegated to cheering the House on from the sidelines of Twitter as that branch worked through and passed its version of the net-zero emissions bill that is now in final negotiations.
 The administration last week also did its part for global warming by rolling out a new clean peak standard that aims to encourage a reliance on renewable power sources to meet energy demand during peak hours, instead of falling back on dirtier fossil fuels like oil.
 Even though negotiations last week didn't yield any deals, those talks have to be going better than the discussions between Congressional Democrats and the White House over a new COVID-19 relief package.
 For starters, they're still going on, which can no longer be assured in Washington. But Democrats and Republicans can't get on the same page for an extension of enhanced unemployment benefits or the $500 billion in unrestricted relief money governors are requesting.
 The House passed a total package of $3 trillion already, while Republican leaders would reportedly like to get that down to $1 trillion. With the state budget's outlook riding in part on relief funds, the impasse makes Beacon Hill look somewhat prescient in pushing off its budgeting decisions for longer than just August.
 Baker finally put his signature on a three-month, $16.5 billion interim budget that leaders say will carry state government through October, but the governor rejected an Oct. 31 sunset on the authorization, and said the Legislature's attempts to impose minimum spending thresholds stepped on his toes at a time when he needed flexibility to manage through a pandemic and fiscal crisis.
 The bill sought to restrict Baker from spending less on any line item than either the fiscal 2020 budget or what the governor proposed in January in his House 2 budget.
 Leaders, however, have been silent since Baker sent that proposal back with an amendment in which he pledged to report to them if he finds ways to accomplish the same goals while spending less.

“If our only recourse is to default to eLearning,” Barton said, “that would be a failure on our part.”
 About 1/3 of District 56’s 2,700 students will take a virtual option, through the Laurens County Virtual Academy. For the 2/3 attending in-school, five days a week face to face instruction, larger classroom spaces in District 56 schools mean more chances to spread out, Schrantz said. Wearing masks and social distancing are two medically recommended ways to slow down the spread of the airborne, potentially deadly Coronavirus/COVID-19.
