The Kuberg Ranger won't come cheap, though. The MSRP will start at $6,150 and various add-ons and higher-end packages will push the price up to as high as $8,449. However, there are likely to be various discounts and "early bird" pricing incentives as part of the Indiegogo campaign, which could make the price more reasonable. Early indications are that the Kuberg Ranger could start at under $5,000 with pricing incentives for pre-orders.

West Indies lost both their opening batsmen early and were 3-25 at lunch after England declared in the first session to set the visitors a target of 312 on the final day of the second Test in Manchester on Monday.
 England's declaration meant they had 85 overs -- thus giving them the opportunity to take the second new ball if required -- to bowl out the tourists and level the series.
 Stuart Broad had opener John Campbell caught behind in the first over, with the wicket awarded upon a last-second review when the UltraEdge system detected a spike as the ball passed the bat.
 Kraigg Brathwaite was the next to depart for 12 when he was rapped on the pads by Chris Woakes and the umpire was in no doubt when he raised the finger.
 Broad struck again to remove Shai Hope for 7 with a delivery that seamed off the pitch and struck the top of off stump.
 Earlier, England resumed on their overnight score of 2-37 and Ben Stokes got straight into the action, looking to cart the West Indies bowlers all around the empty stadium to bring up his half century in only 36 balls.
 Skipper Joe Root also scored a quick-fire 22 and was run out as he sacrificed himself to get Stokes back on strike. First innings centurion Stokes was unbeaten on 78 off 57 deliveries, which included three sixes, when England declared at 129-3.
 West Indies have a 1-0 lead in the three-Test series, which is being played behind closed doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic, after winning the first test in Southampton. The third Test will also be played in Manchester.

Re-opening our economy safely requires protections for small businesses and job providers from costly, frivolous lawsuits by establishing a safe harbor for businesses and workers that follow proper safety guidelines and are trying to do the right thing. Additionally, requiring each federal government agency to perform a cost-benefit analysis of regulations waived during this crisis will determine if these government rules were truly necessary or if it was simply burdensome red tape.
 We should stop the unfair tax treatment toward training and tuition assistance in order to support workforce mobility, reduce the barriers to work currently imposed by a web of government credentialing requirements, and provide more flexibility with paid family leave without raising taxes, expanding bureaucracy, or burdening small businesses.
 We have a lot of work to do to reopen Michigan safely, but by working together and advancing smart, common sense policies, we can rebuild a healthy economy for our family, neighbors, and community.

Johannesburg, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 20th Jul, 2020 ) :World Cup-winning Springbok Schalk Brits believes the future of South African rugby lies in Europe after New Zealand said there was no room for sides from the republic in Super Rugby.
 "All of this jet lag and flying across different time zones just does not work," said the hooker who retired after the triumphant 2019 World Cup campaign.
 "We have got so many South Africans playing in Europe and it would be awesome to see them in action here for European clubs." With New Zealand favouring a trans-Tasman Super Rugby competition, South Africa Rugby chief executive Jurie Roux will address the media Tuesday about the way forward.
 There has been no rugby in South Africa since mid-March due to the coronavirus pandemic, which claimed 5,033 lives by late Sunday, the most in an African country.
 Here, AFP Sport looks at the possibilities for the world champions Springboks and Super Rugby teams the Bulls, Lions, Sharks and Stormers.
 Rugby Championship There has been speculation that the six-round annual tournament will be cut to four matches with New Zealand and Australia playing in South Africa only every second year.
 That would be a huge blow for SA Rugby coffers as the century-old rivalry with the All Blacks makes them a huge drawcard.
 South Africa might consider abandoning the Championship and pursuing a suggestion by former All Blacks Justin Marshall and Jeff Wilson for three-Test tours between the great rivals.
 "British and Irish Lions tours are so successful because we look forward to them," noted another ex-All Black, John Kirwan. The same could be said of an All Blacks-Springboks series.
 'Seven Nations' Should South African franchises move north, would the Springboks follow suit and apply to join England, France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales in a 'Seven Nations' championship? Having the world champions on board would surely excite the organisers and costs would be greatly reduced if the Springboks played their three away matches on consecutive weekends.
 England, Ireland, France and Wales, in particular, would bring freshness for rugby followers, who have not rushed to the turnstiles for Championship visits by Australia and Argentina.

 The first seasons of the show were arguably some of the most memorable and, with Netflix now airing them, we've been able to watch them all over again. Rewatching them also means fans have a few questions about where some of the early cast members are now, including Shorty, who was the homeless man Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian ended up taking back to their home.

London, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 20th Jul, 2020 ) :Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says he will stick with error-prone Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea but with a Champions League place at stake many are urging him to drop the Spaniard.
 The 29-year-old's blunders at Wembley on Sunday were a hammer blow for in-form United, who went down 3-1 to Frank Lampard's Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-final.
 De Gea allowed Olivier Giroud's shot to trickle over the line in the dying seconds of the first half and moments after the interval Mason Mount's shot evaded his weak attempted save.
 The Times described his performance as a "horror show".
 Solskjaer conceded De Gea should have saved Mount's goal but stood by the player, who recently surpassed Peter Schmeichel's United appearance record for an overseas player, excluding Irish footballers.
 "Of course," replied Solskjaer when asked whether he would keep faith with his number one, with Wednesday's Premier League clash against West Ham next up.
 "We have been unbeaten for 19 games and both (reserve goalkeeper) Sergio (Romero) and David (De Gea) have played really well in that run.
 "I can't speak for his confidence but he is mentally very strong." Outspoken United legend Roy Keane recently he was "sick to death" of De Gea after the Spaniard failed to keep out Steven Bergwijn's shot at Tottenham and other commentators now insist he must be taken out of the firing line.
 "He's unrecognisable from the 'keeper who won (club) four player of the year awards," former United defender Phil Neville told the BBC.
 "A confident, assured David de Gea saves all three goals. I would be worried, his inconsistency is costing United games." The experienced Romero is waiting in the wings, with two Premier League games remaining and a tight battle for the final two Champions League spots.
 Solskjaer might rue omitting the Argentine at Wembley, having started him in all the FA Cup ties before the semi-final.
