BB: Well, we played a lot of players defensively at all positions. So, those guys were all out there. Of course, anytime you play a team with multiple receivers on the field – which the majority of the time, Miami had four receivers on the field, including Gesicki – so that forces you to use more defensive backs, and the safety position is part of that. So, a lot of rotation on the defensive line, on the outside linebackers, defensive ends, inside linebackers, all three of those guys played and our four safeties and corners played as well. So, I think you saw that rotation all the way across the board, but of course there's more defensive backs, especially when Miami was behind there in the fourth quarter and was not two-minute but kind of was two-minute – they had the two-minute situation at the end of the half, so probably a third of the game in terms of total number of plays were let's call it pretty obvious passing situations or passing groups. So, that always leads to more DBs on the field.

Uma eventual união da esquerda para concorrer à Prefeitura do Rio não se concretizou. A última vez que isso aconteceu nas eleições municipais do Rio foi em 1992 quando PT-PPS-PCdoB-PSB se uniram na frente 'Feliz Cidade'. Este ano, partidos como PT, PSOL, PDT, PC do B, PSTU e PMB lançaram candidaturas únicas. Até teve um manifesto assinado por artistas como Caetano Veloso e Malu Mader pedindo Marcelo Freixo como representante da frente única da oposição.


  "Nenhuma cidade passa pelos governos do PMDB e do Crivella sem sentir profundamente a corrupção e o crime organizado nas suas estruturas. Vencer isso não é papel de herói. É preciso maturidade e união", defende o deputado federal do PSOL.


  Sobre o abaixo-assinado, Freixo frisa que a candidata dele é Renata Souza e que tinha dito que estará aberto ao diálogo "sobre alianças contra o bolsonarismo". "Agora e sempre", afirma.


  Para a deputada Martha Rocha, candidata do PDT, por duas razões não avançou a unidade da esquerda. "Primeiro, a impossibilidade de coligação na proporcional. Ter um candidato é algo importante para o partido na campanha para vereador. A segunda questão é que a união das esquerdas partiu de um 'contrato' de adesão com Marcelo Freixo", afirma a ex-delegada.


  "Será que o Freixo é o único representante da esquerda com condição de governar? Se pensarmos em forma conjunta o melhor nome, e não ter que aderir à campanha de Freixo, talvez o resultado fosse outro", vislumbra. "Com todo respeito a todo mundo que lançou o nome dele, existe vida além de Marcelo Freixo", acrescenta ela.


  De acordo com a pré-candidata à Prefeitura do Rio, a deputada federal Benedita da Silva, a chapa de unidade que vinha sendo construída com PSOL e PT acabou não acontecendo por causa da desistência de Freixo.


  Benedita conta que a união da esquerda traz vantagens como unificação de forças, militância e tempo de rádio e TV. "Por as vantagens, mas também pelo princípio da unidade programática e estratégica, eu sempre valorizo a política de alianças entre as forças da esquerda".


  Benedita lembra que houve um período longo de aliança das esquerdas, inaugurado nas eleições presidenciais de 1989 com a Frente Brasil Popular, reunindo PT, PC do B e PSB.


  "Perdurou até a reeleição da presidenta Dilma, pois, em seguida, veio o golpe de 2016. As exceções foram nas eleições de 2002 e 2014, quando o PSB disputou em separado. As esquerdas atuam unidas nas lutas pontuais nas ruas e no Parlamento, mas nas eleições a tendência é sempre fazer a disputa programática no primeiro turno e se unir eleitoralmente no segundo turno com o partido que conseguir chegar lá", pontua.

Hurricane Sally – one of four storms churning simultaneously in the Atlantic – closed in on the US Gulf Coast on Monday as governors declared states of emergency. With Sally bringing rapidly strengthening winds of at least 100mph and heavy rain, forecasters have warned of &ldquo;potentially historic&rdquo; flooding.The slow-moving storm was forecast to brush the south-eastern tip of Louisiana and then blow ashore late on Tuesday or early Wednesday near the Mississippi-Alabama border, the National Hurricane Centre said.Hurricane warnings stretched from Morgan City, Louisiana, to Navarre, Florida – a stretch of more than 300 miles.Alabama governor Kay Ivey asked the president to do the same for her state after the National Weather Service in the city of Mobile warned of the increasing likelihood of &ldquo;dangerous and potentially historic flooding&rdquo;.The weather service forecast waters could rise as much as nine feet above ground in large parts of the Mobile metro area. With a population of 400,000 people, it is among the largest metro areas along the Gulf Coast between New Orleans and Tampa, Florida.Some businesses in Mobile placed sandbags at their entrances in preparation.Florida governor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency in the Panhandle&rsquo;s westernmost counties as the hurricane&rsquo;s outer bands began to lash the area. Along the storm-weary Gulf Coast, residents rushed to buy bottled water and other supplies ahead of the hurricane, which powered up to Category 2 in the afternoon.Forecasters said sustained winds could reach 110mph, just less than Category 3 strength, by landfall.Seawater and sand swept onto roads on one end of Dauphin Island off the coast of Alabama, washing away several cars, Dauphin Island Mayor Jeff Collier said. He said around a dozen people had to be evacuated.In coastal Mississippi, water spilled onto roads, lawns and docks well before the storm&rsquo;s arrival. All of the area&rsquo;s 12 casinos were ordered to shut down on Monday afternoon and governor Tate Reeves urged residents of low-lying areas to prepare to evacuate.&ldquo;This is the real deal, and it deserves your attention,&rdquo; Mr Reeves wrote on Twitter. &ldquo;Be smart. Prepare for worst. Pray for the best,&rdquo; he said.Reeves said Sally could dump up to 20 inches of rain on the southern part of the state. Shelters opened, but officials urged people who are evacuating to stay with friends or relatives or in hotels, if possible, because of the coronavirus.The town of Kiln, Mississippi, where many homes sit high on stilts along the Jourdan River and its tributaries, was under a mandatory evacuation order, and it appeared most residents obeyed.For only the second time on record, forecasters said, five tropical cyclones swirled simultaneously in the Atlantic basin at one point on Monday. The last time that happened was in 1971.In addition to Sally were Hurricane Paulette, which passed over a well-fortified Bermuda on Monday and was expected to peel harmlessly out into the North Atlantic; and Tropical Storms Rene, Teddy and Vicky, all of them out at sea and unlikely to threaten land this week, if at all. Rene was downgraded to a trough of low pressure Monday evening.Sally was about 135 miles (217 kilometers) south of Biloxi, Mississippi, on Monday night, moving at 6 mph (9 kph). The hurricane&rsquo;s sluggish pace could give it more time to drench the Mississippi Delta with rain and storm surges.Sally was moving west-northwest Monday night but forecasters expected it to turn slightly east.The extraordinarily busy hurricane season — like the catastrophic wildfire season on the West Coast — has focused attention on the role of climate change.Scientists say global warming is making the strongest of hurricanes, those with wind speeds of 110 mph or more, even stronger. Also, warmer air holds more moisture, making storms rainier, and rising seas from global warming make storm surges higher and more damaging.In addition, scientists have been seeing tropical storms and hurricanes slow down once they hit the United States by about 17% since 1900, and that gives them the opportunity to unload more rain over one place, as 2017&rsquo;s Hurricane Harvey did in Houston.

  “The downturn is across the board, with almost three-fourths of regional economies projected to contract — the largest such share in the past 6 decades,” the bank said in the latest update to its outlook.


  While the vast region is expected to bounce back next year, with GDP projected to grow 6.8%, it will be “substantially smaller” than forecast before COVID-19 struck.


  “Thus, the regional recovery will be L-shaped or ‘swoosh-shaped’ rather than V-shaped,” the bank said, noting a prolonged pandemic was the main threat to the outlook.


  The bank warned that reimposing tough virus restrictions could hamper the recovery and even trigger “financial turmoil”.


  “While economies in developing Asia remain resilient, continued policy support is needed to underpin recovery,” ADB chief economist Yasuyuki Sawada said.


  Policy support packages announced to the end of August had reached a total of $3.6 trillion — about 15% of regional GDP, the bank said.


  China, where the virus first emerged late last year before morphing into a pandemic that has infected more than 29 million people worldwide, was one of the few economies to buck the downward trend in the region.


  After successfully beating back the disease, the world’s second largest economy is forecast to grow 1.8% this year and 7.7% in 2021, the bank said.


  In contrast, India, which is one of the hardest hit countries in the world with over 4.8 million infections despite lengthy lockdowns, is expected to shrivel by 9% in 2020 before expanding by eight percent next year.


  “The path and speed of economic recovery in regional economies will depend on many different factors, the most important of which is ability to control and contain the pandemic,” the ADB said.


  ## Increased poverty


  As regional economies contract this year the number of poor people will likely rise by at least 78 million, reversing a reduction in poverty over the past three to four years, according to the report.


  Inflation however is expected to remain “muted” owing to depressed demand and lower oil prices, it said.


  Another relative bright spot was trade. While the region’s exports had contracted, they had fared better than the rest of the world thanks to stronger demand for Covid-related health supplies and electronics.

It’s a striking, dramatic change. It retains the order of names as used in Japanese, for one, while giving a visual cue to the importance of family name over given name. The drawback, of course, is that it may seem that in traditional Japanese culture, surnames must be screamed at loud volumes at all times. (That’s because, for all you Japanese readers, all caps in English symbolizes someone yelling.)


  The change had been long in the works, with the National Language Council first recommending a swap in 2000, citing the importance of paying respect to linguistic and cultural diversity. The Agency for Cultural Affairs says that in this regard Japan is aligning itself with other East Asian countries that put family names first, including China, South Korea and Vietnam, embracing the traditional values that hold the importance of family over that of the individual. “It is desirable that personal names be presented and written in a way that preserves their unique forms,” says the Council on National Language.


  The difference is that Japan has used the first-name-first order in Western languages since the mid-19th century. It started with Japan’s bid to culturally and technologically Westernize, a small but crucial element that put Japanese on equal footing with the imperialistic Western nations. At this point the standard has held up, particularly in international business, for nearly 150 years.


  Recent surveys have shown that a majority of Japanese support the change. A professor of cross-cultural communication at Rikkyo University even called the adoption of Western name order “insulting” to Japanese tradition.


  The reaction among Japanese communities with international ties has been mixed. Some argue that such a move will cause confusion and cost businesses money, and signal that Japan is taking a step away from its ties to Europe and the United States. Others say that the change is nothing more than politically motivated nationalism. Japanese consultants and businesspeople see the first- name-last-name order on their English business cards as a representation that they can do business the Western way, not just the Eastern way.


  If you start thinking of all the potential problems with bilingual names, the issue really opens up. When interacting with Americans in Japanese or with Japanese in English, the spoken language tends to set the cultural terms. I’m always Margolis- _san_ in Japanese until I ask people to call me Eric (to which they still affix - _san_ ). Likewise, a Japanese person will be called by their first name in an English-language setting unless they ask otherwise.


  So does the media have a responsibility to uphold the cultural values of a name, that you or I wouldn’t in a conversation? If so, would that mean - _san_ should be added when writing about a Japanese person in English, for the sake of upholding tradition? Does the Japanese government want Donald Trump, for example, to refer to Yoshihide Suga as Suga- _san_ if he mentions him in a speech?


  As a translator, I see both sides of the argument. Some translators opt for pulling the original language’s culture into the reader’s language, while others opt for pushing the reader into the original language’s culture. A translator focused on demonstrating the family-oriented, traditional aspect of Japanese names would write ABE Shinzo, while a translator focused on drawing a parallel between a Japanese prime minister and a European one would write Shinzo Abe. The former emphasizes the cultural difference of Japan, and the latter emphasizes the parallels between governmental systems. It’s a tough decision for a news organization to make.


  Ultimately, if Japanese people want to be referred to by their last names first in English, it’s worth respecting. But it’s still important for translation to highlight connections rather than differences between cultures. The “unique culture forms” of Japan can be a slippery slope that, with bad translation, leads to Orientalism and divisiveness.


  Either way, can we at least agree to DROP THE ALL CAPS? I know I don’t want to have a little voice in my head screaming “SUGA!” every time I look at the news.

Cal Fire pays firefighters well, very well. (And perversely well compared with the thousands of California Department of Corrections inmates who serve on fire crews, which is very much a different story.) As the California Policy Center reported in 2017, "The median compensation package -- including base pay, special pay, overtime and benefits -- for full time Cal Fire firefighters of all categories is more than $148,000 a year."


  The paydays can turn incentives upside down. "Every five, 10, 15 years, we'll see an event where a firefighter who wants [to earn] overtime starts a fire," said Crystal Kolden, a self-described "pyrogeographer" and assistant professor of fire science in the Management of Complex Systems Department at the University of California, Merced. (She first picked up a drip torch in 1999 when working for the US Forest Service and got hooked.) "And it sort of gets painted as, 'Well, this person is just completely nuts.' And, you know, they maybe are." But the financial incentives are real. "It's very lucrative for a certain population of contractors."


  ## California makes it too hard to execute controlled burns


  By comparison, planning a prescribed burn is cumbersome. A wildfire is categorized as an emergency, meaning firefighters pull down hazard pay and can drive a bulldozer into a protected wilderness area where regulations typically prohibit mountain bikes. Planned burns are human-made events and as such need to follow all environmental compliance rules. That includes the Clean Air Act, which limits the emission of PM 2.5, or fine particulate matter, from human- caused events. In California, those rules are enforced by CARB, the state's mighty air resources board, and its local affiliates. "I've talked to many prescribed fire managers, particularly in the Sierra Nevada over the years, who've told me, 'Yeah, we've spent thousands and thousands of dollars to get all geared up to do a prescribed burn,' and then they get shut down." Maybe there's too much smog that day from agricultural emissions in the Central Valley, or even too many locals complain that they don't like smoke. Reforms after the epic 2017 and 2018 fire seasons led to some loosening of the CARB/prescribed fire rules, but we still have a long way to go.


  "One thing to keep in mind is that air-quality impacts from prescribed burning are minuscule compared to what you're experiencing right now," said Matthew Hurteau, associate professor of biology at University of New Mexico and director of the Earth Systems Ecology Lab, which looks at how climate change will impact forest systems. With prescribed burns, people can plan ahead: get out of town, install a HEPA filter in their house, make a rational plan to live with smoke. Historical accounts of California summers describe months of smoky skies, but as a feature of the landscape, not a bug. Beasley and others argue we need to rethink our ideas of what a healthy California looks like. "We're used to seeing a thick wall of even-aged trees," he told me, "and those forests are just as much a relic of fire exclusion as our clear skies."

El presidente de la Liga profesional de Fútbol (LPF), anunció este domingo que la "idea es que el campeonato vuelva entre el 9 y 16 de octubre", en un intercambio con el público en su cuenta de Instagram.


  "La idea es que el futbol vuelva entre el 9 y el 16 de octubre, siempre y cuando la pandemia lo permita. Por eso estamos esperando una reunion con el Ministerio de Salud para que de la autorizacion correspondiente", explico el titular de la LPF que todavia no se puso en marcha en la faz competitiva, luego de reemplazar a la hasta ahora denominada Superliga.


  Estas fechas propuestas por el tambien presidente de San Lorenzo fueron las que empezaron a manejarse la semana pasada, despues de que quedara definitivamente de lado la del 25 de septiembre, algo que tambien se mencionaba dentro de un terreno totalmente hipotetico.


  Inclusive trascendio desde las cercanias de la LPF que estaria armado un borrador para que el proximo certamen, muy acotado en cuanto a tiempos, se desarrollara con los 24 equipos divididos en seis zonas de cuatro, luego playoffs y finalmente partido final unico para clasificar a Copas Libertadores 2021 y Sudamericana 2022 a los ganadores.


  Sin embargo ahora, y conforme los tiempos se sigan acortando, los dirigentes tendran que ir ajustando ese formato lo maximo posible. En este certamen, lo unico que estaba firme era que los puntajes acumulados no sumarian ni restarian en la tabla de promedios para el descenso.

“There are lots of people who experience period poverty,” DeMaria said, “not just in developing countries, but here in the U.S. as well.
 “When people don’t have access to period products, it can be this domino impact on their life. So it can negatively impact their health, it can impact their access to education (and) it could impact their academic performance.”
 Menstrual cups may relieve some of these detriments caused by period poverty.
 “Having this product that you can rely on for your whole cycle, every month, for 2-3 years, can relieve a lot of stress and anxiety,” Frank said.
 By offering free menstrual cups to students on campus, the initiative provides an affordable option for those who encounter financial barriers to period products or new, more sustainable methods.
 “We also know that it doesn’t work for everybody,” Mortimore added, “so having a free option to try it out and not have to drop that $30 (to) $40 is amazing.”
 The Period Project and FACT both emphasize education as well as accessibility.
 FACT and the Period Project host events and speakers to discuss feminist issues and menstruation education. In the future, FACT hopes to organize events surrounding voter registration and women’s rights and issues on the ballot, according to Claire Glenn, the president of FACT and a junior in the College of Agriculture.
 “We are also hoping to do a reproductive justice and the black feminist future keynote and panel,” Glenn said.
 Glenn said reproductive justice means “having the bodily autonomy for not only you but your entire family and to be able to make decisions about your body and your family’s future.”
 While its focus is on the future of feminism, FACT also values the history that has led the movement to its current point.
 “Reproductive justice is actually a movement that was coined and created by black women,” Glenn said. “So we want to take reproductive justice and the future of black feminism and have them meet together.”
 DeMaria said that holding these events and facilitating these discussions is essential in promoting education and understanding. It’s up to more than just menstruators, though, to dismantle the stigma surrounding menstruation.
 “Non-menstruators can try to make sure that they are not reinforcing some of these negative perpetuated myths associated with menstruation, that (it is) dirty or bad or something that needs to be hidden,” DeMaria said. “Understanding can go a long way to help somebody who’s dealing either with the physical or the mental or emotional impacts of menstruation.”
 Students will be asked to pick up their menstrual cups at either Krach Lawn or Memorial Mall once they've shipped. For any questions, both organizations encourage individuals to contact them at purduefact@gmail.com and purdueperiodproject@gmail.com.

Not even spotting the Avila Eagles two touchdowns could spoil the day for the Bethel College football team in a 34-24 win Saturday in the season opener at Thresher Stadium.


   


  The combination of Chantz Scurry and Zach Esau allowed the Threshers to overcome the deficit. Scurry rushed for 122 yards on 28 carries with a touchdown. Esau rushed for 67 yards on 16 carries with two touchdowns and hit three of four passes for 70 yards and a score.


   


  Scurry also led the Threshers' ball control efforts in the second half to control the clock.


   


  "That's what we preach," Scurry said. "We work really hard and our O line was really great. We practice really hard, and when something bad happens, we try to make something good happen. We were down at first, but we really turned it around."


   


  "I don't even remember the first quarter at this point," Bethel coach Terry Harrison said. "It was a lot of first-game stuff. We're getting into the flow of stuff. We've been practicing with bags lately and we play such a physical brand, that's what took us so long to get going. I'm proud of the kids for picking it up."


   


  Scurry said the loss of spring football and the disruptions of COVID-19 make it difficult in the off-season.


   


  "It was pretty rough with the gyms being closed," Scurry said. "I found a way to work out."


   


  Bethel's Amondr'e Schumptert-Street had just two carries, but finished with 80 yards rushing.


   


  Avila was led by Tristan Askan, who stepped in for projected starter John Jacobs III, who didn't play. Askan hit 21 of 35 passes for 261 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions. Malik Nesbitt had 14 carries for 57 yards and a touchdown. Nesbitt added seven catches for 91 yards. Devin Senerius had seven catches for 113 yards.


   


  Bethel fell into a hole early. The Threshers picked up a fumble in the red zone when Jesse Garcia grabbed the ball out of the quarterback's hand, but two plays later, a Bethel fumble was returned 80 yards by Ryan Petitfrere for a touchdown. Avila then mounted a long drive that ended with a Nesbitt 11-yard run.


   


  The rest of the half belonged to the Threshers. A drive aided by a 46-yard Trey Palmer kickoff return ended with a one-yard Scurry run. The PAT kick was missed. Bethel then scored on a pair of one-yard Esau runs. Bethel got a Logan DeMond kick and a Camryn Harrison two-point conversion run. A Steven Marks interception set up the third BC score.


   


  A bad punt snap early in the second half gave Bethel the ball on the Avila 34. Six plays later, Camryn Harrison scored on a three-yard run.


   


  Avila stayed in the game with a 32-yard Kaivon Mortazavi field goal, the first for the Eagles since Nov. 3, 2018.


   


  Bethel replied in three plays on a 49-yard pass from Esau to Brayden Francis. Again, Bethel missed the PAT kick. A 15-yard penalty on the kickoff set up an eight-yard touchdown pass from Askan to Christian Hopkins.


   


  Bethel got the ball to the Avila 2, but fumbled it away. Avila was given a penalty after the play with the ball put on the one.


   


  Bethel forced a punt to get the ball back and worked almost four minutes off the clock before losing a fumble at the Avila 36. A Davon Mason interception got Bethel the ball on the Thresher 25 with 2:39.


   


  Bethel plays at 6 p.m. Saturday at McPherson. The Bulldogs opened the season with a 58-40 win over Sterling College, which received votes in the NAIA pre- season poll.


   


  "I think they're going to be really good," Harrison said. "I think McPherson is going to be one of the sleeper picks in our conference. They did a good job of recruiting. We're going to have to watch the film on them."

New episodes of _ DC's Legends of Tomorrow _need to come ASAP so we can get to the bottom of the insane developments from that truly wild season finale. As you'll recall, the gang jumped to a future in which the Fates still controlled society, forcing our madcap heroes to turn to the Museum of Bad Ideas — which included a whole exhibit dedicated to Sisqo's chart-topping single "Thong Song"— for a way to defeat the powerful goddesses. A bizarre battle ensued and the Legends squared off against reanimated Encores like Courtney Ford's Marie Antoinette while Sisqo showed off his eloquent vocals and smooth dance moves in the background.


  Although our favorite misfits defeated the Fates in the end —with help from Charlie (Maisie Richardson-Sellers)— they were faced with an entirely new problem: Sara's (Caity Lotz)  abduction. The final moments of Season 5 featured Sara being swept up by a sea of blue lights as the crew made their way back to the Waverider. We don't yet know why she's been kidnapped that will need to be addressed when the series returns with new episodes.

The defense, while not quite on the level of the famed Steel Curtain, was plenty stingy and physical. It not only held Saquon Barkley to 6 yards on 15 carries, it also swarmed him in the backfield nearly all night.


  Three Steelers stars got them their first touchdown. All-Pro linebacker T.J. Watt made a clever interception at the New York 36. Roethlisberger beat a blitz with a perfect throw to JuJu Smith-Schuster for a 10-yard second-quarter score. Chris Boswell’s extra point hit the upright, leaving them behind 10-9.


  They got the lead with 7 seconds remaining in the half as Roethlisberger connected with James Washington, who dived into the end zone for a 13-yard score. Boswell made the PAT this time, and added a 36-yard field goal early in the final quarter. That came following the night’s biggest play.


  Even though the Pittsburgh defense broke down as the Giants marched 87 yards on 19 plays in just under nine minutes in the third quarter, it still came up with a major stop. Bud Dupree pressured quarterback Daniel Jones as he rolled left from the 4 and deflected his pass.


  Edge rusher Cam Heyward practically made a fair catch in the end zone for the interception.


  Roethlisberger then took Pittsburgh 62 yards for the field goal and a 19-10 lead. He hit Smith-Schuster again for a 10-yard touchdown and a 26-10 lead before New York got a late TD.


  SLOPPINESS


  Not unexpectedly, sloppy play was the order of the evening early on.


  New York had a dropped pass by Evan Engram and a delay-of-game penalty on fourth-and-1.


  The first time a Steeler touched the ball this season, it was a muff by punt returner Diontae Johnson deep in Pittsburgh territory. Oshane Ximines recovered at the 3, but New York only managed a 21-yard field goal by Graham Gano.

"My dreams are coming true!!! I'm so excited to finally share the news that i am getting the opportunity to make my acting debut in HE'S ALL THAT which is a remake of one of my all time favorite movies, SHE'S ALL THAT," Easterling wrote on Instagram.


  Devotees of "She's All That" were suspicious of the casting news and social media response turned sour in some cases. Easterling is best known on TikTok for her dancing prowess, and she's no stranger to the spotlight as a former trained dancer.


  But Easterling has no professional acting experience, and awkward scripted series on networks like Brat TV, which casts young influencers for digital series on YouTube, have shown that TikTok fame and acting don't always go hand in hand (Dixie D'Amelio had a memorable cringe-worthy turn as the lead on a Brat show called "Attaway General").


  "Remember people, just because they're famous doesn't mean they can act," the most-liked response to Variety's tweet announcing the casting says.

La Loteria Nacional (Lotenal), que arrastra problemas de operacion detectados desde 2014, ahora se enfrenta al riesgo de que la venta de cachitos para la rifa del avion presidencial apenas sea suficiente para pagar los 100 premios por un monto de 2 mil millones de pesos que obtendran los ganadores. Ademas, desde agosto La Silla Rota documento una serie de denuncias de burocratas y hasta de altos funcionarios que fueron presionados y obligados a comprar cachitos del sorteo en dependencias como Pemex, Infonavit y hasta en la Sedena. Segun el presidente Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador se tenia proyectada la venta de 6 millones de "cachitos", cada uno a un costo de 500 pesos, lo que daria un monto final de 3 mil millones de pesos. "En el caso de la Loteria serian 6 millones de numeros, de cachitos, para que se entienda; 500 pesos, son 3 mil millones de pesos...si son 130 millones de dolares, estamos hablando de dos mil 500 millones de pesos. Al que ganara el avion se le daria, ya incluido, el servicio de operacion de dos o un año", anuncio el mandatario el 17 de enero de 2020. Sin embargo, a nueve meses de que se hiciera el anuncio, Ernesto Prieto Ortega, director General de Loteria Nacional para la Asistencia Publica (Lotenal), informo, durante la mañanera de este lunes 14 septiembre que solo se habian vendido el 69.65% de los billetes puestos a la venta, lo que equivale a 2 mil 89 millones 500 mil pesos, monto inferior a lo anunciado por Lopez Obrador. "Son 100 premios de 20 millones de pesos cada uno y, como ustedes bien saben, es una cooperacion para equipos medicos y hospitales donde se atiende de manera gratuita a la gente pobre. El siguiente son los ingresos que se han generado al dia 11 de septiembre, dos mil 89.5 millones de pesos. Se han vendido cuatro millones 179 mil cachitos, equivalentes al 69.65 del total disponible". Documentos consultados por La Silla Rota, refieren que el dinero que, hasta el momento se ha recaudado es insuficiente para cubrir el costo de dos mil 255 millones de pesos que ha pagado el Ejercito, solo por concepto de arrendamiento a traves de ocho pagos. "Se hace de su conocimiento que durante el sexenio que refiere-Felipe Calderon Hinojosa-, se adquirio una aeronave marca Boeing 787-8 Dramliner de transporte estrategico para uso de la Presidencia de la Republica, y hasta la fecha se han pagado ocho anualidades por concepto de arrendamiento financiero, por un total de $2 mil 255 millones 842,960.66". VENTAS "VOLUNTARIAS" La Silla Rota comenzo a documentar desde el pasado 12 de agosto que en Pemex se usaron canales institucionales para "solicitar" a los trabajadores comprar cachitos. Incluso, trabajadores relataron que se colocaron stands de venta de billetes en los pasillos de oficinas de la empresa. Posteriormente, tambien se revelo en este medio que en el Infonavit se convoco a trabajadores a que participaran en la compra de cachitos. Lo mismo sucedio en instalaciones militares, para que soldados tambien pudieran comprar. Funcionarios consultados en dependencias federales dijeron que incluso se les habia solicitado que pidieran a proveedores que apoyaran con la compra de cachitos. INDAGAN PRESUNTAS ANOMALÍAS Documentos indican que en 2019 se detecto la inconsistencia en la integracion de expedientes de venta de "cachitos" "con otorgamiento de garantias para la dotacion adicional de billetes a sorteos especiales de la Loteria Nacional". "La inconsistencia de operar un marco normativo interno no confiable y sin revisiones periodicas que aseguren certeza juridica, incide en una regulacion que obstaculiza la optimizacion de los procesos y disminuye la eficacia de la gestion publica", menciona una cedula de observaciones hechas a 2019 por la Secretaria de la Funcion Publica. De acuerdo con la auditoria 06750, efectuada por la ASF, la Lotenal carecio en 2019 de protocolos de seguridad para llevar a cabo sorteos especiales. "Como resultado de este analisis se observo que las areas auditadas no acreditaron la existencia de politicas, procedimientos y criterios para la clasificacion, organizacion, seguimiento, localizacion resguardo y custodia de los expedientes, asimismo no se encontraron directrices documentales para la ejecucion de atribuciones y funciones de los servidores publicos involucrados y obligados a mantener los archivos actualizados, debidamente organizados y conservados". Estos señalamientos son precedidos por las irregularidades detectadas en 2015 por la ASF, en las que se detecto que la Loteria Nacional esta no era capaz de cubrir actividades de las actividades que realiza. Segun el analisis de la Cuenta Publica 2015, en 2015 se tuvo un deficit de 566.4 millones de pesos, lo que llevo a la federacion a transferir 527.6 millones de pesos, debido a la baja en las ventas de billetes de loteria. LOTENAL, EN CRISIS Un documento del gobierno federal de 2014 dictamino que la Loteria Nacional estaba ya sumida en crisis. Esta dependencia nacio el 16 de agosto de 1920 por decreto presidencial, pero para el sexenio de Enrique Peña Nieto las ventas entre 2008 y 2014 habian caido en casi 500 millones de pesos. El mismo informe reporto que las principales amenazas radicaban en que la poblacion que compra billetes de loteria eran principalmente adultos o adultos mayores, mientras que la poblacion mas joven perdia interes en este tipo de sorteos. Un reporte publicado en El Universal en junio de 2014 señalo que la cartera vencida era la principal debilidad de la Lotenal. De hecho, para 2010 el gobierno tenia claro que la Lotenal estaba perdiendo atractivo. En ese entonces el mercado formal de juegos y sorteos implicaba un monto de mas de 77 mil millones de pesos, pero el 74% correspondia a los juegos en linea, 20% a la Loteria Nacional y el resto a casinos. Ademas, el gobierno detecto que el crimen organizado ataco hasta a los vendedores de cachitos y que, en estados como Michoacan, Tamaulipas, Guerrero, Veracruz, Zacatecas y Chihuahua, en 2014, les cobraban "derecho de piso" y hasta llegaron a pagar rescate por secuestros.

14th September 2020


  Paris St Germain (PSG) forward Neymar has said he was the target of a racist slur during the French champions’ 1-0 defeat by Olympique Marseille on Sunday, the BBC reported.


  The 28-year-old, one of five players sent off during the match at the Parc des Princes, informed the fourth official of the comment while walking off the pitch.


  Littered with fouls throughout, the clash boiled over in the last minute of stoppage time when a full scale brawl broke out on the pitch.


  PSG’s Neymar, Laywin Kurzawa and Leandro Paredes as well as Marseille’s Dario Benedetto and Jordan Amavi were sent off after players aimed punches and kicks at each other.


  Neymar, who struck Alvaro Gonzalez on the back of the head, tweeted after the match that his only regret was not hitting the Marseille defender in the face. – Reuters

Oh, that. For the first time since Jan. 1, 2000 — when he was a senior at Michigan — Tom Brady played a football game in something other than a New England Patriots helmet. Brady's Tampa Bay debut didn't go as planned; Drew Brees and the New Orleans Saints prevailed 34-23 in the matchup of over-40s.


  Brady is a legend; Alec Mills is a journeyman pitcher who entered Sunday with a career record of 38-46 at the MLB, minor league and fall league levels of baseball.


  Only one of them threw strikes Sunday.


  Mills — whose only other complete game as a professional was a seven-inning effort in the Carolina League 5 1/2 years ago — pitched a no-hitter for the Chicago Cubs in Milwaukee, blanking the Brewers 12-0.


  "I know how much comes along with that," Cubs manager David Ross said after the second no-hitter of the season. "That's history. You get to make history. That's a special day for us, a special day for Alec Mills. That was fun to be a part of, fun to watch."


  It was a special day for Mirim Lee, who won her first LPGA major by claiming the ANA Inspiration — chipping in for eagle on the 72nd hole just to get into a playoff. It was a special day for Dominic Thiem, who rallied from two sets down against Alexander Zverev and won the U.S. Open men's title in a classic five-setter at a strangely empty Arthur Ashe Stadium.


  For the Louisiana-Lafayette Ragin' Cajuns, it wasn't a day like no other. It was just a day like none other since Nov. 1, 1943 — the last time, before Sunday, that the AP Top 25 football poll came out and they were on the list. It was a Top 20 back then during World War II, including such schools as Arkansas-Monticello, Colorado College, Iowa Pre-Flight and Del Monte Pre- Flight.


  They went to Iowa State on Saturday and won 31-14, just the program's second all-time win in 22 tries against Big 12 competition. The Cajuns were ranked No. 19 Sunday.


  "Achieving this national ranking has ignited our fan base and alumni," athletic director Bryan Maggard said. "The notoriety not only highlights the accomplishments of our football program ... but puts our university in the national spotlight as well."


  The reigning WNBA champion Washington Mystics got a last-day-of-the-season win to clinch the last remaining playoff spot in their league, meaning they'll have the chance at back-to-back titles.


  "This is a sports junkie's heaven right now," Mystics coach Mike Thibault said. "You could sit in front of your TV and watch a lot of different stuff. Thinking back to last April when there was nothing on. We were all searching for what we would do to entertain ourselves. Fun to be part of getting sports to go again."


  Indeed, sports are going again.


  Differently than before, sure, but definitely going again.

Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy plans to digitalise 45,000 schools by the next academic year, said Audimulapu Suresh, State Education Minister.


  "Officials are working day and night to meet the CM's deadline of completing work on the Nadu-Nedu initiative by the beginning of the academic year in June," said Suresh.


  It will be the first time in the history of Andhra Pradesh that government schools will give tough competition to the private schools and institutions in terms of digitalisation.


  This plan will be implemented in a phased manner. In the first phase government has its aim to install 10,000 smart TVs, the cost of which comes up to a total of 45 crores to 50 crores.


  Every government school in the state will be having its own smart television for the digitalised learning, so the days are gone wherein for good education parents use to think of sending their children to private schools at a higher cost.


  Earlier in the first week of September in a review meeting held at the camp office in Tadepalli by CM Reddy, it was directed to the officials that no student should be left out of digital education and all government schools should be equipped with the centralised integrated system smart TVs.

"Many different elements are needed," Suga said on Monday, when asked about who should replace him. "One is their fit with the prime minister, but thinking about it overall, they also need to have broad strengths, that will be the most calming."


  Suga is virtually certain to be elected prime minister in a parliamentary vote on Wednesday because of the LDP's lower-house majority. He will serve out Abe's term as party leader through September 2021.


  Known more for his work behind the scenes, Suga emerged as favourite to replace Abe, Japan's longest-serving premier, after Abe said last month he would resign because of ill health, ending nearly eight years in office.


  There is widespread speculation that Suga could take advantage of strong support ratings to dissolve the lower house of parliament and call snap elections to earn a full three-year term as LDP head, but he appears wary.


  "What's important now is to contain the pandemic while also reviving the economy. I don't think we can immediately (dissolve the lower house) just because the pandemic is contained," Suga said. "That's a decision that must be made looking comprehensively at various factors."

It wasn’t what the young Abilene Cowboys wanted as an outcome after playing the first home football game on the new playing surface at Cowboy Stadium. The Concordia Panthers came to town and claimed their second win on the season with a 42-0 win over the Cowboys.


  Abilene did show some improvement in week two after falling 57-0 a week ago at Clay Center. Cowboy head coach Brad Nicks saw a lot of positives in game two as the Cowboys continue to buy into the new system and learn a totally new offense on the gridiron.

PLYMOUTH - Plymouth Area Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Amy Naples and Chamber Director of Operations Bob Nolet have pulled another rabbit out of their hats.


  No, the Plymouth Area Chamber of Commerce's Waterfront Festival did not happen this summer due to COVID-19.


  But the Chamber is still moving forward with several absolutely free events next week and weekend that should deliver plenty of fun and joy, as well an economic boost. A Cruise Night, POP-UP Artisan Marketplace and Virtual Ducky Dash will help enshrine the Chamber's reputation for unstoppable progress even during a pandemic.


  Sponsored by Tiny & Sons Auto Glass, the Chamber's Cruise Night is set from 5 to 7 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 17 at 180 Water St. in Lot 4. Want to show off your ride? Hop online to plymouthchamber.com and enter your car in the show for $12. Naturally, space is limited, so don't hesitate. Visitors will enjoy the free event, admiring the cars, and the Chamber will award best in show at the end of the evening.


  "We though this would be a great activity for families to enjoy and for people to visit the local businesses in the area as well," Naples said.


  The Chamber's Virtual Ducky Dash at 1 p.m. Friday, Sept. 18, should attract kids of all ages who will see just how fast their rubber ducky can "paddle." Ducks are $2 or $6 for 10 and can be purchased at plymouthchamber.com. Visit the Chamber's calendar and click on the Ducky Dash. Competitors will be assigned numbers and tune in to the Chamber's Facebook page to view the Ducky Dash live at Brewster Gardens at 1 p.m.


  Next up, the Plymouth Waterfront POP-UP is set from 3 to 7 p.m. Friday, Sept. 18 and from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 19 in Nelson Park, featuring an Artisan Marketplace.


  "It's basically for local artisans to sell their products and wares," Plymouth Area Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Amy Naples said. "We know that industry has been impacted, so we came up with this idea to generate some revenue."


  The governor's social distancing guidelines will be followed to the letter, Naples said, noting that everyone must wear a mask.


  "We have contact tracing and will have sanitation units throughout," she added. "And we have implemented even more measures to ensure the safety of everyone."


  Many have said they relied on the Plymouth Waterfront Festival in years past to do all their holiday shopping, Naples added. This artisan fair is perfect to do just that. While the festival isn't allowed at the moment, due to the governor's guidelines, this scaled-down fair allows for socially distancing. The Nelson Park parking lot can only hold so many cars, and, with masks, everyone should be safe, Naples said.


  If you and your family want to enjoy the festivities, don't forget to wear a mask; it's required. For more information, visit plymouthchamber.com.

She said anything that would limit the tools they have to respond during the pandemic will have health consequences.


  “We strongly recommend people continue to practice the efforts to stop the spread of the virus,” she said.


  State Rep. Carl Walker Metzgar, R-Somerset Township, said that he was pleased with the judge’s ruling.


  “This is confirming everything I’ve been saying all along,” he said. “Constitutional rights are not suspended because one or two people say so.”


  The ruling means that current restrictions, including ones that limit the size of indoor and outdoor gatherings, can’t be enforced, attorney Thomas W. King III, who represented the plaintiffs, told the Associated Press.


  “It’s really 100% in our favor. The court found in all respects that the orders issued by the governor and the secretary of health were unconstitutional. What it means is they can’t do it again, and they should not have done it in the past,” King said.


  Courts had consistently rejected challenges to Wolf’s power to order businesses to close during the pandemic, and many other governors, Republican and Democrat, undertook similar measures as the virus spread across the country.


  Wolf has since eased many of the restrictions, allowing businesses to reopen and canceling a statewide stay-at-home order. The lawsuit was filed in May.


  But over the summer, his administration imposed a new round of statewide pandemic restrictions on bars, restaurants and larger indoor gatherings in response to rising infection rates in some virus hot spots. The state has been enforcing a gathering limit of no more than 25 people for events held indoors and no more than 250 people for those held outside. It has also been restricting occupancy at most businesses to 75% capacity, and 50% at theaters, gyms, salons and malls.

The companies being feted this month achieved their successes in happier times, but Tillekaerts does not think this diminishes their achievement. “In these difficult times, we are more convinced than ever that we need to celebrate these export success stories and put them in the spotlight.”


  The contenders for the Export Lion award for companies with fewer than 50 employees are interior design specialist Basalte, sensor company Caeleste and organic fertiliser producer Fertikal. Above 50 employees, the nominees are food slicing specialist FAM, network software company Lansweeper and sport surface designer Sports and Leisure Group.


  The awards will be presented by Flemish minister-president Jan Jambon. “Flanders has so many world-class players, who all too often operate behind the scenes or in very specific niches,” he commented. “We can rightly be proud of them and of their contribution to prosperity and job creation in our region.”

Marion County Circuit Court Judge Patrick Wilson approved the settlement agreement Monday during a brief hearing where the Santini estate and the contracted attorney for the city agreed to the proceedings.


  The victim's wife, Emily Santini, pushed for a jury trial for Streyle with advise from attorney Tony O'Dell, of Charleston, but the request was thrown out. However, the Santini estate and O'Dell were able to come to a settlement with the City of Fairmont for the $1.8 million. This money will be divided up between Emily Santini and her three sons, with an amount of $4253.90 being paid as a fee to O'Dell for legal counsel.


  In putting the case to rest, O'Dell said Steven Gene Santini was "a devout man of God" and went on to discuss the three steps of repentance. He said the first step is to accept one's transgression, take full responsibility for it and then, take action to right the wrong that had been committed.


  "We all try to teach our children to make it right when they do something wrong," O'Dell said. "The [Santini] family is glad that the city’s insurance company saw the writing on the wall and paid what is fair under the law. But Officer Streyle, and for that matter, the powers that be with the city of Fairmont, will never have closure until there is true repentance."


  O'Dell went on to say that the city and the Fairmont Police Department should accept responsibility for Santini's death.


  "Now that the case is over, for their sake and the sake of the Santini family, they should call, accept full responsibility and tell the family that they deserved every penny plus their heartfelt apology. And, they should tell Emily and Steven Santini, the son, that they learned from their transgressions and that changes have been made so no other innocent life is lost," O'Dell said.

Millions of dollars are spent on tree thinning and brush clearing every year in Western states, though many argue more needs to be done. But scaling up the costly, labor-intensive work as more people move into mountains and forests has many challenges.


  Forest thinning helped save the town of Sisters, Oregon, from a wildfire in 2017. But out of 30 million forested acres statewide, prescribed burns have been used on only roughly a half percent a year, Gersbach said.


  In Washington state, a prescribed burning program hasn’t yet begun on state lands, said Department of Natural Resources spokesman Thomas Kyle-Milward. The state helps manage deliberate fires on thousands of acres of federal lands each year.


  Many places don’t have the capacity or the money to do the work, said John Bailey, an Oregon State University professor of tree growth and fire management. There are no longer enough mills to handle salvageable timber, whose proceeds can help offset the costs of forest thinning.


  "Sometimes I feel like we are making progress at increasing the pace and scale of resilience treatments, but largely, the same issues are at play, and progress has been slow,” Bailey said. "More folks are probably ‘on board’ to the ideas, but implementation is hard.”


  And as more people move into rural areas or build vacation cabins in the woods, prescribed burning is less of an option.

The underlying base running metrics provide a bit more context to the Jays' performance on the base paths. First off, the team is actually pretty good at stealing bases (1.6 wSB, sixth) and a little bit above average in terms of beating out double plays (0.5 wGDP, 15th). They are, however, subpar in terms of advancing between bases (-2.3 UBR, 24th), which certainly jibes with what our eyes are telling us.

I’m talking about the season to harvest corn silage.


  Much of the corn you see in the fields across the region will soon be gone, well before it is time to harvest the grain alone. Corn harvested as silage is a staple of beef and dairy cattle rations. Yes, the corn kernel or grain is important, but there is a whole lot of nutrition available in the stalk and the leaves if the whole corn plant is harvested.


  Why, you might ask, is it of such importance that a farmer would be willing to forgo anything and everything to see to its conclusion?


  It’s about quality.


  First, the corn plant must reach the proper state of maturity before harvest can begin. The corn grain itself must be mature enough to provide the energy necessary for the cattle’s diet. Corn silage with immature grain would just be a letdown for the cows.


  Second, the corn plant must go through somewhat of a drying process to be ready. Once the moisture content of the entire corn plant (grain, stalk, leaves and the cob) reaches 50 to 70%, it’s time to chop the corn.


  That’s a wide range, but the actual window on any given farm for the moisture content of the plant is much narrower. Corn being put into a trench silo needs to be a little wetter than that which goes into a bag silo. That corn-in-the- bag silage needs to be a little wetter than that which goes into an upright concrete silo. and the corn in the upright concrete silo should be a little wetter than that which goes into an upright blue steel silo. Whatever the method of ensiling, the window for harvest is pretty narrow.

FALL RIVER -- Sean Martin knows what it feels like to be a "non-essential" entrepreneur.


  "I was out of work for nine weeks," the professional barber said.


  It's been nearly three and a half months since he returned to cutting hair at his Whiskey & Steel Barbershop at 202 Bank St.


  "I signed the lease three days before I was allowed to open," in early June, he said.


  Martin, 31, was required to shut the site of his first barber shop business by March 24 after Gov. Baker issued his executive order stipulating that, until further notice, only "COVID-19 Essential Services" involving face-to- face interaction could be delivered -- as a means of minimizing the spread of the coronavirus.


  He says his wife during that time was laid off from her job as an esthetician performing skin treatments and facials.


  Martin says it's fortunate he qualified to collect unemployment payments as part of the federal CARES Act and its Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which was designed to help people who are self-employed, "gig workers"; and independent contractors.


  Martin is the latest tenant of a building that sits at the corner of Bank and Purchase streets and includes the Pink Bean coffee shop, the basement-level St. James Irish Pub and apartments upstairs.


  His shop directly faces the Tequila Lime Cantina restaurant and bar, which he says is a plus in terms of attracting new customers.


  During the previous three years he owned and operated a barbershop he called Buffington Barber Company out of the nearby Buffington Building at 10 Purchase St.


  Martin, who has a 4-year-old son, says his wife's grandfather helped them out by paying the rent on their Somerset apartment while they were out of work.


  "I wouldn't mind him paying a little longer," he joked. "But it's nice being back to work."


  His shop has just two chairs, the second of which Martin says will be used starting in November by barber and hair stylist Kaleigh Pinto.


  Only one customer for the time being is allowed inside, and appointments, which can be made in person or on the phone, are required, Martin said.

NEW BEDFORD -- There's a mystery afoot at the Fort Taber-Fort Rodman Military Museum and Bill Niedzwiedz, museum president, is hoping the public can help him solve it.


  The mystery surrounds four photos that were dropped off at the museum from an anonymous source.


  "Somebody brought them in and figured we'd like to have them since they are military," Niedzwiedz said. He was only told the pictures were found during a house clean out. He said the people dropped off the photos as the museum was closing and didn't give the address of the house where the photos were discovered.


  "We were closing -- literally shutting off the lights -- when the photos were dropped off," Niedzwiedz said.


  Niedzwiedz said since the photos were brought to the museum, it's likely the house where they were found is in New Bedford. However, he said the military museum is also very well known in Rhode Island, which broadens the area of where the photos possibly came from.


  "I hope we can find their relatives and return these photos to the family," Niedzwiedz said.


  One photo is a studio portrait of a Navy sailor, most likely from World War II. His uniform indicates he was a machinist mate. Niedzwiedz said he cannot tell what the ribbon on his uniform represents because it is old, and the colors might not be accurate because the portrait was colorized.


  The stamp on the back of the photo denotes that it was taken in a photo studio on the 6th floor of the Callender, McAuslan & Troup building in Providence. The building is located on Westminster Street and was built in 1866. It's housed many businesses over the years, including Lupo's Heartbreak Hotel, a Providence rock music institution in the 1980s, according to the Providence Preservation Society.


  The second photo is of a young man, dressed in a suit and tie.


  Both photos are inside a folding, gold-tone frame, so it's possible that both men are related.


  There is another photo of 11 sailors and two Navy officers standing in front of four old Naval Air Station vehicles.


  The fourth photo is taken at the same Naval Air Station with sailors crouching in the front row, and others standing behind them, flanked by three Naval officers.


  Niedzwiedz posted the photos on social media hoping someone might recognize the men and the location of the Naval Air Station in the other photos.


  He hasn't received any responses yet.


  The Standard-Times has also reached out to the archives department at Providence City Hall, and is hoping for a response to an inquiry about the old photo studio that was located inside the Callender, McAuslan & Troup building.


  Niedzwiedz said this isn't the first time someone has donated items to the museum without any attribution of where the items came from.


  "We have a bust of Father DeValles. It was just sitting at the front door one morning. Someone had just dropped it off," he said.


  He recalled one time when a woman found out a picture of her great uncle, John Santos, was hanging in the museum.


  "She flew all the way from Hawaii just to take a picture of the picture for a family reunion," Niedzwiedz said. It was the only picture she had of him. He said he offered to give her the original, but she wanted that one to stay at the museum.


  Niedzwiedz said the mystery photos might be the last remaining photos of the men in the family.


  Anyone who recognizes the men in the photos or the location of the Naval Air Station can contact the Fort Taber Fort Rodman Military Museum at 508-994-3938.

Synagogues are being creative this fall when it comes to celebrating Rosh Hashanah (the Jewish New Year) during the Covid-19 pandemic.


  Typically a time for warm family gatherings and in-person worship, many Newton temples have opted to hold virtual services to mark the year 5781 on the Hebrew calendar. The holiday starts on the evening of Sept. 18 and ends the evening of Sept. 20.


  "To ensure that all members of our community are safe and have equal access to our High Holiday observance, services this year will happen in a digital format," said Rabbi Allison Berry of Temple Shalom.


  Temples Reyim and Emanuel are also offering online services - both prerecorded and live - with one of the most important elements also taking place outside the temple so worshippers can attend: The blowing of the shofar.


  "We are … having a series of programs outside the synagogue [for Rosh Hashanah]. For example, our community members are coming to Temple Reyim in small groups to hear shofar blown," said Rabbi Daniel Berman of Temple Reyim.


  The shofar is typically a ram's horn blown like a trumpet on Rosh Hashanah and at the end of Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement.


  "Members of our synagogue who are skilled at shofar blowing will go to various outdoor locations throughout Newton to blow shofar at an appointed hour," said Lisa Einstein, director of marketing and digital strategy at Temple Emanuel. "Members will sign up in advance to receive the locations and attest to health. The shofar blower will keep distance and cover the shofar while he or she blows."


  Temple Shalom members already held their event outside of City Hall.


  Aside from shofar blowing, the three synagogues are celebrating most parts of the service over the internet.


  "Our clergy, staff team and our High Holiday Advisory Group felt strongly that despite our disappointment the holidays can't happen as planned, we should use this unique moment to try new and innovative ways to bring prayer and meaning to our congregation," said Berry.


  For those who are most isolated during this important time in the Jewish year, Berry recommended they surround themselves with photos of loved ones and create a "sacred space" in their own home.


  "This won't make up for empty seats at holiday tables, but it can help these days to feel a little more like the holidays," she said.


  "If you're not with family and friends, eating and praying together, it can feel like a very significant loss. I encourage people to connect with their loved ones, even by phone or online if needed," said Berman. "Like many of us did last spring for the Passover seders, you could even have a meal together across the country through Zoom."


  At Emanuel, Einstein advised that people "connect using any means available and go the extra mile to let them know you are holding them in your heart and in your prayers."


  In person for the holiday


  Because the Adams Street Shul is an Orthodox synagogue, president Mark Whittum said, "We are not able to do Zoom services on the holidays themselves due to restrictions on use and handling of electronic equipment."


  Therefore, they will hold in-person services at the temple, although there will be "Zoom sermons from the rabbi before holidays to enable people to participate in community activities even if they can't make it to synagogue on the holiday," according to Whittum.


  Somewhat shortened services will be held outside in tents, with a limited capacity (40 or less) and staggered seating, he said.


  As with the other temples, the blowing of the shofar will take place outside, "directed away from people and with the mouth of the horn likely covered with a face mask," said Whittum.


  For those who cannot attend out of health concerns, Rabbi Meir Bier said that in order to feel connected, "as much as possible, try to feel a part of your community, even if it's an emotional participation, rather than a physical one.


  "Try to meditate on what your community means to you, how you have contributed to its collective welfare in the past, and how you will strengthen those connections in the future when, God willing, we can be together again," said Bier.


  The Adams Street Shul is located at 168 Adams St.


  Temple Emanuel is located at 385 Ward St.


  Temple Reyim is located at 1860 Washington St.


  Temple Shalom is located at 175 Temple St.

Anything over 200 to 300 is considered very unhealthy to all individuals with recommendations to avoid strenuous outdoor activities, keep them short or rescheduling them.


  Mariners manager Scott Servais said none of his players had any issues or complained about the conditions after the first game.


  “It's one of the reasons you know you got the roof on so you get some backdrop there and you can see the ball when it goes up in the air,” he said. “So no issues there. It’s certainly a little bit different than what you're used to, but nobody had any problems.”


  In the other clubhouse, A’s starter Jesus Luzardo said he did have problems with the conditions.


  "I mean when I came out I think it was at 284,” Luzardo said.  “I’m a healthy 22-year-old, I shouldn’t be gasping for air, or missing oxygen, when I’m getting to the line. So I’ll leave it at that."


  Luzardo’s teammates didn’t seem to have as much trouble with air quality. With no on-field work or batting practice, most of them still were on the field in the hours leading up to the game, playing catch and participated in spirited games of hacky sack and also a modified soccer game.
