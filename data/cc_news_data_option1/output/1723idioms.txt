 The COVID-19 outbreak is unlike any other crisis we've faced, and it is testing the resiliency of communities across the nation.
 In the Third District, like in most places, small businesses are closed, families are home, students are learning remotely, and many others are worried about their futures.
 Some people are wondering what it is all for, as perhaps they have not been personally impacted by COVID-19.
 The clearest answer is that it is to save lives. It is to save our grandparents, our friends, neighbors or family members who may be at higher risk of severe illness or death from the virus. Taking these measures seriously and working together greatly improves our chances to reopen businesses and return to regular order sooner rather than later.
 While the actions taken by the federal government, states, counties and municipalities to temporarily close communities, limit travel and certain commerce may seem harsh, the strategy is based on mountains of public health data on what has happened with COVID-19 in other cities and countries.
 Adhering to the guidance set by the experts who have conducted these studies is working.
 Social distancing has so far prevented over-burdening medical facilities in our district with sick patients and has saved the lives of countless others.
 Through a combination of adhering t0 guidance of experts, and additional financial support through Congress, we have prevented rural hospitals from shutting down in the middle of a public health emergency.
 Many rural health centers struggle under normal circumstances, and provisions in the CARES Act contained direct funding to these facilities. I was glad to see this critical legislation signed by President Trump and supported almost unanimously in Congress.
 As many of us remain at home to help flatten the curve, this waiting period does not make the economic impacts of this pandemic any easier, especially for those who are out of work or facing the possible loss of their business. That is why the CARES Act was a necessary means for the government to step in and return your tax dollars to your communities as a lifeline to keep families paid and businesses afloat. It is already having a significant impact in the Third District where rural communities are often hardest hit by economic downturns.
 Prior to COVID-19, rural Colorado was experiencing some of the same economic growth seen by Denver-metro areas following the 2008 recession. To help support small businesses that have been delivering that growth, the CARES Act established the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). This program has provided a vital lifeline to ensure impacted businesses stay afloat for now and quickly rebound when the outbreak subsides.
 In Colorado, over 28,000 businesses have already been approved for PPP loans totaling over $5.8 billion. Due to the popularity of the program, the funding for the loans ran out on April 16. Many business owners are now in limbo, waiting for Congress to add additional funds to the program.
 Unfortunately, efforts to immediately address this loss of available funds, Democratic leaders in Congress are actively blocking additional funds for these programs in order to increase federal spending on separate programs that remain fully funded. This is completely unacceptable.
 Playing partisan politics with people's livelihoods in the middle of this crisis is shameful and reckless, and I am calling on my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to pressure Senator Schumer and Speaker Pelosi to move a clean extension of the PPP today without adding more unnecessary federal spending.
 Coloradans have a long history of coming together during times of crisis. I continue to be amazed at the kindness and generosity shown by individuals and community leaders. While the federal government has a big role to play in the recovery, the brunt of the effort falls on local communities where leaders from all walks of life and all political persuasions have stepped up to make the best of a tough time.
 During this crisis, a vast majority of people continue to do the right thing by accepting the gravity of the situation at hand and embracing this temporary way of life to keep their communities healthy and save lives. We are all in this together, and I promise to keep doing my best to fight for our communities so that we can return to normalcy as soon as possible.
 In the meantime, I always welcome your comments and ideas and encourage you to reach out to my office if I can be of service to you.

LANSING -- State lawmakers representing Ottawa and Allegan counties believe Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has gone too far in enacting a state of emergency without consent from the Legislature.
   
 Speaking during a teleconference with the Michigan West Coast Chamber of Commerce on Friday, May 1, several legislators said Whitmer needs to work with the Legislature to transition the state beyond the current restrictions in place due to the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 "These are extremely challenging times for so many of us," said Sen. Aric Nesbitt, R-Lawton. "... But there's no doubt that this is inflicting very significant harm to our economy and the financial well-being of people around the state."
   
 The chasm between the GOP-controlled Legislature and the Democratic governor resulted in lawmakers declining to extend the state of emergency that expired April 30, instead passing a resolution to pursue legal action against Whitmer.
   
 "... We've been working really hard to sit at the same table with the governor," said Rep. Mary Whiteford, R-Casco Township. "And every time we turn around, we're kicked off the table. This is very frustrating.
   
 "We believe there are three parts to government, there's checks and balances, and after all this time, we need to be a part of this process."
   
 Whitmer has cited the Emergency Powers Act to enact authority to extend a state of emergency. On Thursday, she extended the state of emergency to May 28, along with other public gathering restrictions.
   
 "While some members of the legislature might believe this crisis is over, common sense and all of the scientific data tells us we're not out of the woods yet," Whitmer said in a statement Thursday.
   
 "By refusing to extend the emergency and disaster declaration, Republican lawmakers are putting their heads in the sand and putting more lives and livelihoods at risk. I'm not going to let that happen."
   
 Rep. Jim Lilly, R-Park Township, believes Whitmer should at least consider plans that have been put forward by the Legislature to begin reopening the economy.
   
 "Really, both of our plans were more of a framework in nature," he said. "What we were really looking for in putting those forward was to open up a discussion with the governor.
   
 "No one, at this point, in the Republican caucus is saying, 'We're ready to reopen everything today.' Everyone recognizes we're in a state of serious pandemic.
   
 "But we need to transition from this concept of essential industries versus nonessential industries to workplace behaviors that are safe versus unsafe. We have to follow ... leading practices in other states, rather than best practices because this is a virus that is evolving. Our knowledge of it is still evolving."

In 2009, Pueblo human service agencies were dealing with a large number of clients who were struggling with high bills from two utility companies in Pueblo. Clients of the Board of Water Works (BOWW) and Black Hills Energy (BHE) often were shut off due to nonpayment of their bills.
   
 The bills, along with fees and deposits, were becoming too excessive for the agencies to pay, especially when there was no assurance that their service would stay on for any length of time.
   
 Representatives from Catholic Charities, Centro de Los Pobres, Posada and United Way met together to understand the issues and to work on mitigating the harm to local households. It was decided that the agency representatives would meet with the officials at both companies.
   
 Efforts to inform BHE went nowhere. To quote their external affairs director at the time, "BHE is an investor-owned utility and their allegiance is to their stockholders, not to their customers."
   
 The agency representatives were surprised but undaunted and worked diligently with many local agencies and people to change the policies at BHE. No substantive changes were made to the customer policies at BHE until eight years later when the Pueblo City Council made a decision to "study the off- ramp" in a September 2017 vote. Then, and only then, were efforts pushed through to modify their harsh shutoff/reconnect policies.
   
 The Board of Water Works was a different story. Catholic Charities, Centro de Los Pobres, and Posada provided a presentation to their board about the difficulties many clients were having paying their water bill and they responded in substantive and practical ways. BOWW quickly changed their deposit and other policies so that human service agencies could assist households and be assured that the service would stay on for a reasonable time for those homes.
   
 A fund also was established that is available year-round and is under the director of Catholic Charities of Pueblo. Agencies that assist households with water bills now only have to call and speak to a specified representative at the BOWW, guarantee payment and the account will be kept on. This saves a lot of wear and tear on agencies and on individual households who are struggling.
   
 BHE also has a designated account manager who is assigned locally to deal with past customer accounts.
   
 The bottom line for households and businesses in Pueblo is that the rates are too high and that the decisions that impact all of Pueblo's electrical use are being made in South Dakota and Denver. Agencies still have to come up with funds they don't have to assist families who are struggling and BHE bills are a hardship for many households.
   
 The number of households that are being shut off hasn't changed. For the last three years, the annual number of shutoffs in Pueblo has averaged 6,800 households. This is consistent with previous averages of the past seven years. Some households are never able to get electric utility service in their name again and this impacts their ability to retain housing or clear up credit scores.
   
 No one is naive enough to believe that with a new electric provider in Pueblo, shutoffs will cease, electric bills will no longer be a burden for some households, and that some bill-payers will not renege on payment arrangements.
   
 What is crystal clear to many is that past is prologue. Should Pueblo stay with an investor-owned utility that is focused on profit over people or should our community support municipalization and a community partner like BOWW?
   
 BOWW is positioned in the best possible way to ease the transition to local public power and has shown over time that Pueblo citizens matter to this Pueblo agency.

I have worked in criminal prosecution for over 25 years. I was the Chief Deputy District Attorney in the Lincoln County DA’s Office for over 6 years and resigned in December 2019. I was Lanee’s direct supervisor in the office and I can tell you that she has what it takes to be a great district attorney for Lincoln County.
 District attorneys arguably have more power and discretion than any other elected official. The district attorney does not answer to anyone, except the voters every 4 years. That is why it is imperative that Lincoln County elect a district attorney who has sound judgment and will always do the right thing for the right reasons to keep the community safe. Lanee Danforth is that person.
 The DA is responsible for applying the law equally to everyone (rich or poor, influential or not). Applying the law equally to everyone requires the DA to know and understand the law as it is written and interpreted by the courts. Lanee knows the law better than anyone. She was consistently the “go to” person in the office when anyone (DDAs and law enforcement) had questions. Lanee knew things about the law that DDAs and defense attorneys with decades of experience didn’t know. Rather than patronize anyone, Lanee always educated and trained colleagues with patience and humility. I have even observed Lanee, on more than one occasion, educate judges regarding nuances in the law.

"But it's Bruno Fernandes who really excites me.
 "The £47million buy from Sporting Lisbon looks tailor-made for United and could prove to be one of the club's most important acquisitions in recent years.
 "He hit the ground running, seamlessly slotting into midfield and playing with the confidence and authority of someone who'd been there for years.
 "It's no coincidence that United's form improved dramatically when Fernandes came in.
