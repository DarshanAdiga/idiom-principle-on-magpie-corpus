En el local de la calle de Embajadores, en Madrid, los sacos se apilan en varias torres que llegan hasta el techo. Las paredes tiznadas delatan su contenido. Carbón vegetal de encina, “el más aromático del mundo”. Marabú cubano en tacos pequeños, “ideal para hacer pescado”. Quebracho argentino y cáscara de coco, este último para cocinar “sin hacer humo”. Benayas, autor del libro _Entre brasas_ (Planeta Gastro), es una enciclopedia andante sobre combustibles, iniciadores del fuego y utensilios varios. Para él, la barbacoa constituye un “estilo de vida” aún por descubrir en España, que nada tiene que ver con comida poco saludable. “La gente viene al Barbacoa Club pensando que solo van a aprender a cocinar panceta y chorizo. Tenemos cursos de iniciación con 20 platos distintos que van desde carne y pescado hasta pizzas y bizcochos”, aclara. Habla de la escuela que creó hace ocho años con el objetivo de difundir una técnica que, puntualiza, es diferente a la parrilla. “Una cosa es hacer grilling, que es cocinar con fuego directo, y otra hacer barbacoa como los americanos, que se hace con madera o con carbón y en la que el humo va cocinando el producto a temperaturas bajas”. A la pregunta de si la brasa será otra tendencia gastronómica pasajera, Benayas responde: “Cocinar con fuego aporta una serie de matices que no puede darlos ni el gas ni la electricidad. La brasa se va a quedar”.

An Argentine funeral worker is asking soccer fans for forgiveness after a photo of himself in front of Diego Maradona's open casket prior to the sports icon's funeral was posted online. Claudio Fernandez, the funeral worker under fire, was pictured standing next to the body of Maradona in a casket with his son, who was giving a thumbs-up.
 This image understandably sparked global outrage and general ire towards Fernandez and his family. He told an Argentine radio station that he has received death threats in response to the photo.
 "They say they are going to kill us, break our heads," he told Radio 10 in Buenos Aires on Friday.
 According to the manager of the funeral parlor, Fernandez, along with the other men who took photos beside Maradona's body, was an "outsourced" employee. The parlor has organized funeral services for members of the Maradona family in the past, which added to the devastation of the whole incident, per the manager.

That isn't from the Buffalo game, but a loss to the Raiders. I did forget that we wore the powder blue uniforms that season. I didn't forget that we almost went winless, with the only victory being against a Warren Moon-led Chiefs team. Rivers going to Indy and us drafting Herbert is one of those rare situations where it works out for both parties. Even if Rivers wins a Super Bowl, it was the right call to let him walk. What's most concerning is that we easily could have lost to the Jets last week. I see that my post may not have gotten published, but you can sense my attitude going into the game. Campbell could have been flagged on that fourth down play, sadly. Casey Hayward was abused all day, but he won't be out there tomorrow. Neither will Melvin Ingram, who may very well have played his final game for the Chargers.

I guess that's all for now. The Chargers usually play pretty well at 1PM, despite flying in from CA. Remember when Lynn made them stay in Denver last season to prepare for Mexico? That worked out not at all. Come to think of it, didn't he also say there would be guys missing from Sunday's lineup after the blocked punt in Miami? Kelley missed a block on special teams even though Long takes forever to kick the ball. Kelley and Murray have really had their confidence shaken this year. Anyway, I'll see you out there tomorrow.

According to the National Federation of Independent Business, Americans spent about $19.6 billion at the nation’s nearly 32 million independent businesses in 2019. In light of thinner Black Friday crowds at malls and retailers across the country, expectations for this year’s Small Business Saturday were tempered.
 “We have so many unique shops, little shops that people may not even be aware of all over the county, from as far south as Pendleton all the way up to Elwood,” said Matt Rust, executive director of the Anderson Madison County Visitors Bureau. “We don’t want to lose these businesses, so I think it’s just important that we get out and support them, and right now is the time to do that.”
 At Soap & Sunshine Apothecary, a shop selling soaps, sanitizer and other skin care products, owner Elizabeth Jones noted that mushrooming demand for those items during the pandemic has contributed to a 40% increase in sales this year compared to 2019.
 “We’ve been really blessed,” she said. “We were able to easily transition to a curbside pickup method, and then we also shipped out a lot more orders than average.”
 As Jones spoke, a steady stream of shoppers flowed through the building. Many of them were eager not only to get started on their Christmas shopping, but also to mingle with other pandemic-fatigued residents and gain a sense of normalcy at the outset of the holiday shopping season.
 “Connection is something that we’ve kind of lost,” said Leigh Bivens as she selected a bar of handcrafted soap. “Just being able to see neighbors and see people and run into some community members, it’s nice.
 "And then also just to remind the small businesses that we love them and care about them and that we want to keep them going. That’s a big deal, especially right now.”
