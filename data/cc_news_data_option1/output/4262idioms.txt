It's called Operation North Star. Put into action early last year, this overhaul is more than a named collection of turnaround wishes and goals that other retailers often present as a plan. Operation North Star has teeth because the action plan Big Lots is implementing is specific. One of the revitalization plan's specific goals is "funding the journey," meaning the changes Big Lots is implementing will at least be somewhat paid for by the reduction of other expenses. The plan also calls for greater focus on high-impact departments such as home goods, and leveraging its own private label brands. Big Lots owns the Broyhill brand of mattresses and bedding, for instance, offering the company complete flexibility in how it's marketed.                                             *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

The full-fledged mock exercise on “counter terrorist contingency” was held around 11 a.m at western departure ramp of the airport. During this drill a mock terror situation was simulated as per the standard operating procedures (SOPs) with activation of relevant security protocols leading to successfully neutralizing of the mock terrorists.

Rudy Giuliani on Wednesday denied inappropriate behavior in a scene from the upcoming _Borat_ sequel. After the media embargo on reviews for the Sacha Baron Cohen movie lifted Wednesday, it was revealed that Giuliani, President Donald Trump's personal lawyer and a former mayor of New York, appeared to touch himself while alone with Borat's underage daughter, a scene that Giuliani now claims was taken out of context.                            Addressing the clip in a series of tweets, Giuliani called the video "a complete fabrication," insisting that he was not inappropriately touching himself, but was rather "tucking in my shirt after taking off the recording equipment." He said that "at no time before, during, or after the interview was I ever inappropriate." He said that if Baron Cohen "implies otherwise he is a stone-cold liar."                            Citing a _New York Post_ report of the scene, which was filmed in July, Giuliani claimed that the scene "looks to me like an exaggeration through editing." He went on to suggest that "this is an effort to blunt my relentless exposure of the criminality and depravity of Joe Biden and his entire family," and, in an apparent effort to shift attention away from the controversy he has found himself in, went on to write, "we are preparing much bigger dumps off of the hard drive from hell, of which Joe Biden will be unable to defend or hide from. I have the receipts." Those final remarks were in reference to a laptop hard drive allegedly belonging to Hunter Biden that Giuliani supposedly obtained. Several news sites have said they were unable to confirm the credibility, according to _PEOPLE_.                            Giuliani found himself swept up in controversy earlier Wednesday after _The Guardian_ published a report on _Borat Subsequent Moviefilm_. The outlet reported that the film included a scene with Giuliani and Borat's 15-year-old daughter, Tutar Sagdiyev (Maria Bakalova) who pretended to be a journalist for a fake conservative news program. After the interview, the two retreated to a hotel room rigged with hidden cameras, where Giuliani allegedly began making advances. After she removes his microphone, he lies back on the bed, undoes his belt, and reached into his pants, appearing to touch his genitals until Baron Cohen, in character as Borat, ran into the room and shouted, "She's 15! She's too old for you!"                            Following the incident, Giuliani had called the New York City police to report that a strangely dressed man had burst into his hotel room without warning, though he later realized it was a gag. Discussing the encounter with _The New York Post_ at the time, he said, "I only later realized it must have been Sacha Baron Cohen. I thought about all the people he previously fooled and I felt good about myself because he didn't get me."                                             *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Bloomberg Opinion) -- Tonight’s second and final presidential debate is set to cover a half-dozen topics, but one really ought to stand out. The Covid-19 pandemic has already claimed  more than 220,000 American lives and is currently taking another 700 each day. Cases are surging in at least 40 states. This week President Donald Trump said, “People are tired of Covid.” Indeed they are. Unfortunately, Covid isn’t tired of America.                            The incumbent has presided over this calamity, and still gives no clear account of how policy should address it. Former vice president Joe Biden has rightly deplored the administration’s performance, but hasn’t said enough about what he’d do differently. Voters deserve some answers.                             Trump resists more testing — it just turns up cases, he complains — and has started to hint at herd immunity as the right strategy. Meanwhile White House adviser Scott Atlas is downplaying masks and social distancing, to the dismay of other members of the coronavirus task force. So Trump should be asked whether the surge in cases should in his view be welcomed. If the president now believes in herd immunity, voters are entitled to know. If not, what does he intend to do about the accelerating rate of infections?                            Biden needs to give some answers as well. He recently said that the pandemic had to be brought back under control before the economy could reopen. But how? He released a detailed plan back in the spring, and he promises to “listen to the scientists” — which would be enormous progress in itself, to be sure. But what might have worked in the spring and summer may not work now. That’s partly because Covid fatigue is indeed real, and is making people reluctant to accept new rounds of severe restrictions.                            What would Biden do to encourage behavior that gets states to a point from which they can launch effective programs to test and trace? Is he for mask mandates, and how would they work? What’s his position on school reopenings?                            After the first presidential debate, it would be foolish to expect much enlightenment from tonight’s event, but one can hope. The pandemic isn’t the only subject, by any means — but it’s of surpassing importance. The more closely the contenders are questioned on the issue, and the clearer they can be, the better.

Continuation of at least six self-financed engineering colleges in Anna University’s Tiruchi region hinges on the extent of admission of students in the fourth round of Tamil Nadu Engineering Counselling for which the provisional allotment will be published on October 28, it is learnt.                            Barring the Anna University- BIT Campus in Tiruchi, several seats in the counselling process were not filled in most of the other colleges in the region in the earlier three rounds of counselling. The trend of admission has not been encouraging in the University's four constituent colleges as well - at Tirukuvalai in Nagapattinam district, Panrutti in Cuddalore district, Pattukottai in Thanjavur district, and in Ariyalur district, sources said.                            Colleges in Tiruchi, Pudukottai, Perambalur, Ariyalur, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam and Cuddalore districts come under Anna Unviersity's Tiruchi region.                            A number of self-financing colleges reportedly bank on the scholarship accruing from the admission of first-generation and Scheduled Caste students. The practice of these colleges has been to identify potential candidates early on and guide them to make their choices in the counselling process. A first-generation graduate is entitled to a scholarship to the tune of ₹ 20,000 per year, and an SC student gets as much as ₹ 70,000 per year, under various heads. However, some of the colleges have not been able to mobilise these categories of students also.                            In recent years, one engineering college was closed due to lack of patronage and another is on the verge of closure. In the absence of admissions, it is mandatory for the colleges to apply for Progressive Closure. Only the existing students will permitted to complete the course.                            Unlike in previous years, the number of students with good cut-off marks has also been low this year. For instance, there were only 12,263 students for the first round of counselling with cut-off between 199.667 and 175. Likewise, there were only about 23,000 students who had qualified for the second round of counselling with cut-off between 174.75 and 145.5. Last year, there were about 35,000 students in the second round of counselling.                            Most of the seats in the self-financing colleges in central districts had hoped to fill the seats this year only in the third and fourth rounds of counselling, sources said.                            According to a functionary of a private college management, institutions cannot sustain without proper admissions for two continuous years.                            On an average, an engineering college requires not less than ₹ 25 lakh per month to cover costs of salaries, electricity, consumables, and other expenditure, leave alone the money required to service bank loans. In the absence of admissions, closure becomes inevitable, he said.                                             *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Bloomberg) --                             While the pandemic has led to a decline in individual fortunes, household wealth has held up.                            That’s one of the main findings in Credit Suisse Group AG’s 2020 Global Wealth Report released Thursday. Thanks to government and central-bank actions to mitigate the Covid-19 fallout, global wealth rebounded from an initial slump in the first quarter of the year, adding $1 trillion by June after ending 2019 at $399.2 trillion.                            “Given the damage inflicted by Covid-19 on the global economy, it seems remarkable that household wealth has emerged relatively unscathed,” said economist Anthony Shorrocks, one of the report’s authors, adding as a caveat that the findings are based on provisional household balance sheets for the second quarter issued by few countries.                            That said, only China and India saw gains in household wealth in the first half of the year, growing by 4.4% and 1.6%, respectively. Latin America, on the other hand, suffered the most, with a 13% plunge, as currency devaluations aggravated losses in gross domestic product.                            Wealth per adult slipped to an average $76,984 from $77,309 at the start of the year, the report found. Switzerland, the Netherlands, Taipei and Hong Kong saw gains, while Norway and the U.K. posted the biggest declines.                            The number of millionaires remained stable after soaring to 51.9 million last year, while the club of the ultra-high net worth individuals with more than $50 million in net assets lost only 120 members to 175,570. In the U.S., which has the most people in the top 1% wealth group and 39% of the world’s millionaires, the inequality gap has narrowed, according to the report.                             The findings come as wealth gains, especially in the U.S. tech world, have been increasingly scrutinized as millions lost their jobs due to the coronavirus hit. Amazon.com Inc.’s Jeff Bezos -- the world’s richest person -- has amassed more than $73 billion this year, taking his fortune to $188 billion, according to the Bloomberg billionaires Index. Facebook Inc.’s Mark Zuckerberg has gained $27 billion to more than $105 billion, while the rise of Zoom Video Communications Inc. has pushed up Chairman Eric Yuan’s net worth by $22 billion.                            Overall, the world’s 500 richest people have added $970 billion to their combined wealth this year, the Bloomberg index shows.                            Female workers, millennials and minorities were hit the most by the pandemic, mainly because of their high representation in businesses such as restaurants, hotels and retail that have been badly affected. Millennials, which also suffered the repercussions from the financial crisis, and the next post-Covid generation will have to deal with reduced economic activity and globalization, as well as discouraged travel, Credit Suisse said.                            “There is the promise of many more surprises to come,” said Nannette Hechler-Fayd’herbe, Credit Suisse’s chief investment officer for international wealth management and global head of the economics and research unit. “Among the major economies, China is likely to be the clear winner.”                            ©2020 Bloomberg L.P.                                             *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Another concern is that swapping out mitochondria (and their DNA) in embryos makes for a slippery slope to designer babies, especially now that three births have occurred after gene editing.

 “In line with the vision of the National Education Policy 2020, the Joint Admission Board (JAB) of JEE (Main) has decided to conduct the examination in more regional languages of India,” tweeted Ramesh Pokhriyal, Minister of Education.
 The examination will be conducted in regional languages where entry to State Engineering Colleges is decided based on an examination (conducted in regional languages).
 “This decision has far-reaching implications as Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pointed out that top-scoring countries in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) examination use mother tongue as a medium of instruction. The decision of JAB will help students comprehend questions better and score higher,” said Pokhriyal in the tweet.
 Meanwhile, earlier this month, the JAB — having the authority to frame the policies, rules and regulations of JEE under the guidance of IIT council has considered the relaxation of the eligibility criteria and decided to permit an extra attempt for those candidates who were unable to appear in JEE (Advanced) 2020 on account of being Covid-19 positive.
 ## Equal opportunity
 “To ensure equal opportunity to all, the JAB has also decided that these candidates will not qualify JEE (Main) 2021 and will be allowed to directly appear in JEE (Advanced) 2021”, said the statement.
 Further it was decided that these candidates will be considered in addition to and not as part of the total number of candidates who would qualify from JEE (Main) 2021 for appearing in JEE (Advanced) 2021.

Close to 400 personnel from across CISF, Octopus, local police, GHIAL security, Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF), terminal operations, Apollo medical centre and other departments were involved in a high-decibel counter terrorist drill at the Hyderabad International Airport on Thursday.                            The full-fledged mock exercise on “counter terrorist contingency” was held around 11 a.m at western departure ramp of the airport. During this drill a mock terror situation was simulated as per the standard operating procedures (SOPs) with activation of relevant security protocols leading to successfully neutralizing of the mock terrorists.                            The airport comes under hypersensitive airport category and such drills are conducted on a regular basis to ascertain the preparedness level of all key stakeholders at the airport in tandem with local authorities to ensure and impart a sense of confidence among the authorities as well as passengers, said a press release.

VATICAN CITY (AP) — Question are swirling about the origins of Pope Francis’ bombshell comments endorsing same-sex civil unions. All evidence suggests he made them in a 2019 interview that was never broadcast in its entirety. The Vatican refused to comment on whether it cut the remarks from its own broadcast or pressured the Mexican broadcaster that conducted the interview to follow suit. And it didn’t respond to questions about why it allowed the comments to be aired now in the documentary “Francesco,” which premiered Wednesday. In the movie, Francis said gay people have the right to be in a family since they are “children of God.” Those comments have caused a firestorm.

Bloomberg) -- Wall Street’s fear gauge is poised to tumble to pre-pandemic levels in the aftermath of a clear-cut election victory for Joe Biden even if U.S. stocks decline in its wake, according to Barclays Plc.                            In projections more aggressive than the futures market is pricing in, the Cboe Volatility Index will likely drop to “at least” 20 if a win for the Democratic contender is confirmed shortly after the Nov. 3 vote, the bank told clients this week.                            While stock traders have turned bullish on the growing likelihood of a Blue Wave, markets remain on high alert for prolonged post-election uncertainty. The November VIX future, which expires two weeks after the vote, is trading at 29, around current levels of the spot index. A level of 30 implies the S&P 500 Index will move around 9% over the next 30 days, according to analytics service SpotGamma.                            “It is important to note that SPX does not have to rally significantly and in fact could even decline; even then, VIX could potentially drop,” strategists led by Maneesh Deshpande wrote in a note.                            Even as the S&P 500 Index surged 55% from its March low, traders have sent the cost of protection soaring in one of the most anticipated event risks in decades. Now, fear of a contested election is easing. While the VIX futures curve remains elevated, it’s dropped across the board compared with a month ago. A series of volatility trades that bet on post-election calm have recently lit up the options market too.                            Yet for all that, the fear gauge has remained stuck at around 30 for months. Through Tuesday, it had risen for seven sessions in a row, its longest streak since the run-up to the 2016 presidential election.                            While demand to hedge election risk and the resurgent virus are pushing the VIX up, it’s also arguably been whipped around by retail investors gorging on call options.                            While shorting the November and December VIX futures would be one way to bet on lower post-election volatility, Barclays strategists recommend positioning for a decisive Biden victory through bearish options on the fear gauge. Traders have recently bought put spreads for instance, which can cut costs but also limit gains.                            “While it is tempting to decrease the cost using put-spreads or put-ratios, we think it would not be prudent to cut off the tail of a substantial decline in VIX, and hence prefer outright VIX puts,” they wrote.                            ©2020 Bloomberg L.P.

“Before the game I said to Jack Harrison, ‘every time you get the ball, I’m going between the middle centre back and the far one, so put the ball there’” _United’s No.9 explained_ after the match.
 “In the first half he did it and I didn’t score and in the second half he did it and I got the goal, so fair play to him for putting it on the money.”
 Unfortunately for Leeds this season, there haven’t been many more examples of that kind of final-third affinity with most goals coming via other attacking avenues.
 Leeds have registered 69 crosses this season ( _via FBref.com_). Only Fulham, who have a gameplan centred around getting the ball into the towering physical presence of star striker Aleksandar Mitrovic, have registered more (88).
 That works out as 4.8 accurate crosses - which is to say, those that find a team-mate - per 90 minutes ( _via WhoScored.com_). That places them at a respectable sixth in the Premier League; only Chelsea, Aston Villa, Burnley, Fulham and West Ham average more.
 But Leeds can certainly improve on their efficiency, especially as Bamford isn’t an aerial powerhouse like a Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Michael Antonio or Mitrovic, who have proven specialists at scoring headers in recent years.

At least 40 million Americans have already cast a ballot in early voting, with still more than a week until Election Day.  
 In this episode of _Political Climate_, we examine if environmental issues are mobilizing voters the way that analysts anticipated. Who are those voters and do they hold sway? We discuss with Nathaniel Stinnett, founder of the Environmental Voter Project, a non-partisan organization focused on identifying inactive environmentalists across the United States and turning them into reliable voters in every election.
 This year, the stakes are especially high. Control of the U.S. Senate is very much in play, while Joe Biden and Donald Trump duke it out for the White House with wildly different policy platforms. Could environmental voters tip the scales?
 We also consider how fracking and natural disasters are playing into the 2020 election cycle, as well as the rise of "big green" political donors. Plus, we check in on a Texas election bet.

COLUMBIA - Even though Columbia Public Schools pre-kindergarten and elementary students have returned to in-person learning, not all children may be going back to the classroom.


  Jumpstart at Mizzou, a program run through the University of Missouri Career Center, will continue to offer virtual Pre-K instruction through the fall semester, even as CPS, one of their partner agencies, opens back up.


  "CPS going back is quite a change for them and their educators and their children and families," Jumpstart program director Chrissie Dickson said. "Layering in another group coming in from the outside, we wanted to be sensitive and respectful to not adding more on their plate."


  Under normal circumstances, Jumpstart trains MU students to lead classroom settings of preschool children and enables them to participate in after-school programs, such as CPS, the MU Family Impact Center and Turn the Page Child Development Center.


  Under COVID, Jumpstart is instead offering virtual preschool tutoring.


  The virtual tutoring sessions are roughly 30 minutes, twice weekly, and are conducted by two Jumpstart tutors: the first for the actual tutoring and the second to assist the first. Lessons are 'disguised' as games for the child.


  "Jumpstart tutors have been trained to sneak in those academic pieces," Dickson said.


  In light of no longer being tied to a physical location, Dickson said Jumpstart is trying to expand services beyond Columbia and mentioned clients located in Hallsville and Ashland.


  "In this remote world, we're targeting families in the whole state of Missouri," she said.


  Dickson said she hopes Jumpstart can provide a valuable service to families who may be uncomfortable sending their children back to an in-person learning environment.


  "Each family is different," she said. "If you've opted out of having your child in an in-person school setting, whether that's due to your personal safety concerns or whatever that reason might be, families are struggling to find quality educational opportunities.


  Madison Wepking has been a Jumpstart tutor for four years. She explained that since tutors can't be physically in the same room as students, they can utilize props and words to assist in learning.


  For example, she would ask a child to describe the feeling of cotton balls to promote a child's language ability.


  "We talk about cotton balls being soft on our face," she explained. "And we ask, 'How do you think it feels?' A lot of them will answer like 'It's white like a cloud!"'


  This allows tutors to segway into what the child thinks a cloud might feel like.


  "It is our hope that in the spring, the pandemic might be in a safer place," Dickson said.


  Wepking agreed.


  "Fingers crossed so much," she said. "The ideal world, if it could be normal, I hope that we can go back in the spring. But if not, this is what it is right now and we've made it work to where we can touch some of the kids' lives.

The artwork also surfaces in little comics advancing the plot after defeating a Guardian in each zone that acts as a boss. It's not the deepest tale, but an interesting one. More important are the Guardians, who change things around when it comes to defeating them. Instead of outlasting them for as long as possible, they start with a set amount of time on the clock, and then they drop orbs throughout the room. Every orb you pick up decreases the timer as you try to hit zero, and they make for some nice and challenging battles. They also embody the various gimmicks in each zone nicely, which play around with the clock even further. In one case, the timer only activates as long as you stay within a central circle, another may have you gaining time via panels you run across on the floor or dealing with a dark room that has blinking spotlights. It's simple yet clever stuff that keeps you on your toes.
