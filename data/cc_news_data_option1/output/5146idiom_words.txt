Although Hyderabad FC are placed above in the team standings, their win doesn’t look inevitable in the upcoming game. While Lluis Sastre and Joel Chianese continue to miss out, Hyderabad are also doubtful about the fitness of their main striker Aridane Santana. Souvik Chakrabarti, however, has been impressive in the mid-field and will have the onus to deliver again. Coming to East Bengal, Lyngdoh will sit out as he faced a red card in the last game. Hence, Surchandra Singh is likely to come back in the initial XI. As the game takes a countdown, let’s look at the ideal Dream11 team.

Aridane Santana (HFC) should be picked as the captain of your team while Anthony Pilkington (SCEB) can be chosen as vice-captain.
