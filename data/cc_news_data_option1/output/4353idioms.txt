The party shocked the establishment by winning the third-most seats. The military's proxy party was able to cobble together a ruling coalition that put Prayuth back in the prime minister's post. But Future Forward looked like it had room to grow.
 Then in February, the Constitutional Court ruled Future Forward had violated campaign finance laws, dissolved the party and banned its leaders from politics for 10 years.
 The students, already upset at what they saw as an undemocratic constitution that shifted power away from elected politicians to appointed bodies aligned with the military, took to the streets.
 "What motivates the student protesters is that they see the 'game' of politics as being fixed," said Chris Ankersen, an associate professor at New York University's School of Professional Studies Center for Global Affairs, who previously worked with the U.N. in Bangkok.
 The initial protests barely had time to spread before the coronavirus pandemic hit, and the students retreated. They returned in July, when the virus threat eased, and pushed their core demands of new elections, constitutional changes and an end to intimidation of activists.
 The protests gathered steam and took a stunning turn in August, when a few students at a rally aired unprecedented criticism of the monarchy. Using direct language normally expressed in whispers if at all, the speakers criticized King Maha Vajiralongkorn's wealth, his influence and that he spends much of his time in Germany. Among their calls were for greater oversight of royal budgets and an end to the practice of Thai monarchs endorsing military coups.
 While shocking to many, it emboldened others.
 Events escalated on Oct. 14 when protesters heckled a royal motorcade that unexpectedly passed nearby. Security personnel stood between the vehicles and the crowd, and there was no visible violence.
 Nevertheless, Bunkueanun and two others were charged under an obscure criminal statute on committing violence against the queen, who was in one of the vehicles.
 "I was numbed, dumbstruck, and feared for my life," Bunkueanun recalled. He turned himself in to police the next day and spent a day in jail before his release on bail.
 Prayuth and his government responded to the incident and the protests with their tested playbook, declaring a state of emergency for Bangkok that banned gatherings of more than four people and gave authorities other broad powers. That only led to even bigger protests and the government eventually removed the emergency decree to try to ease tensions.
 Prayuth has said he is open to some changes but has maintained that the monarchy should remain off-limits.
 "While I can listen to and acknowledge the demands of protesters, I cannot run the country based on protester or mob demands," he said Monday, opening a special session of Parliament his government called to ease tensions.
 The students' questioning of Thailand's social structure is rooted in their experiences at school, said Thak Chaloemtiarana, a historian who has also been an administrator at Bangkok's Thammasat University and Cornell University in the U.S.
 "The current movement, while led by a handful of university students, has attracted younger students who have become politicized through more news and information from the internet and social media, and spurred by how their teachers and school administrators suppress individualism and exercise authoritarian policies that control dress code, haircuts, gender choice, and ceremonies that are seen as originating from feudal times," he said.
 In addition to political injustices, Thak said, young people were spurred to action by what they saw as the king's accumulation of power and wealth with the acquiescence of the military, as well as the military's needless expenditures during a pandemic-weakened economy.
 The protesters' aim at the monarchy has led to counterprotests by royalists who allege the students are being used as pawns by unidentified powers behind the scenes.
 Unlike previous protests, today's demonstrators are far younger and have no clear links to any group or party, making them appear untainted by past quarrels, said Allen Hicken, political science professor at the University of Michigan.
 The government has so far seemed indecisive about how to deal with the protests, torn between trying to placate or punish those involved. Neither approach has lessened the ardor or number of protesters, who adroitly use social media to organize short, quickly announced events that don't require the infrastructure of past demonstrations.
 Police use of water cannons and chemical irritants against the young protesters this month drew broad public outrage, so it's not clear if the government would push a more violent crackdown like those in 1973, 1976, 1992 and 2010.
 Chonticha is aware history is not on the protesters' side, but she says in some ways they have already succeeded.
 "Our movement has changed the perception of Thais toward the monarchy and military," she said. "If we cannot win this time, we still have planted the seed of criticism of the ruling elite and monarchy in the people's minds."

Giving details about the initiative at a press briefing after the 342nd meeting of the Bankers’ Committee in February 2019, the then Director, Banking Supervision Department, CBN, Mr. Ahmed Abdullahi, disclosed that the decision to support the creative industry was born out of the Committee’s conviction that the sector holds the key to job creation, poverty reduction and inclusive growth. Also speaking at the briefing, the Managing Director of Access Bank, Herbert Wigwe, said: “The Bankers’ Committee, after a lot of research identified the creative and IT sector as a critical sector to support social and inclusive growth in Nigeria. We’ve basically found out that the sector would generate a significant amount of employment given how Nigerians inclined in the creative sector have done well in music and others.” According to the CBN, the initiative, which was aimed at enabling businesses to obtain loans up to the tune of N500million, has four different pillars that cut across different fields- fashion, information technology, movies, and music. Eligible businesses in these fields, the CBN said, could access loans under the scheme at a maximum interest rate of nine per cent per annum (all charges inclusive). The regulator also revealed that the scheme would be funded from the AGSMEIS, also an initiative of the Bankers’ Committee.

"There is some confusion because the committee charge includes language that the TAC should act in accordance with the Open Meeting Law," Makarious said. "That appears to have been, from my understanding, a reference to language in one of the town's administrative policies and procedures that says all boards and all committees of the town should act in accordance with the Open Meeting Law."
 The TAC is not required to post its minutes and agendas, he said. Although Crane and the TAC previously agreed to post those, it is not considered a violation.
 Makarious advised the TAC to voluntarily comply with some of the key features of taking and posting meetings and minutes.
 Gailus told the Board she's spent "countless hours" on reviewing the Open Meeting Law and believes the TAC is a public body.
 "If I do bring this up with the Attorney General as a follow-up, and the Attorney General finds that this is not a public body, or it should go by Mina's assessment it is not a public body, that I would like you to please take everything that the committee decides as what the town manager decided."
 Cambridge Turnpike update
 Crane said the end date for the Cambridge Turnpike project will be some time in December. "There's been some issues with the improvements that have been made that needed to be fixed," he said.

 The town has hired a new chief information officer. Jason Bulger is currently the CIO for the Town of Tyngsborough, where he served in that role for the past five years. Before that he was the IT director for the Town of Groton. "He comes in with a lot of great municipal experience," Crane said, "and really blew everyone away throughout the recruitment process." Bulger will start his new position in mid-November.

 In light of the recent controversial events regarding ballot dropoff boxes and early voting, Police Chief Joseph O'Connor said he's listened to concerns residents have shared. "I have been monitoring current events and I just want to assure the Board and the community that the Police Department is in constant daily contact with state, local and federal partners, and there is currently no information that would lead us to believe that we will have any issues here in Concord." The Police Department is constantly reassessing its plans and will have officers at the polls as it does all the time. People who want to vote will get that opportunity, O'Connor said.

 By a 4-1 vote, the Board declined an application by GJC Brothers Inc. (Concord Gas), located at 686 Elm St., for an off-premise package store liquor license to sell wines and malt beverages only.

And then ... Open Door was the better side for the bulk of the match.
 After playing far too direct early, the Patriots did manage some decent combo work on a waterlogged grass pitch and generated some set-piece opportunity.
 Rainers Kinnear had a free kick go begging high in the 19th minute, and Danny Sandoval had an inswinger go just over the crossbar in the 33rd.
 The match got even more chaotic 11 seconds into the second half, when a Phoenix was assessed a rellow (his second yellow card) after an ill-advised slide tackle at midfield.
 Open Door pushed for lifelines and finally got one in the 57th minute. Parker Loescher earned a penalty kick after contact on the left side of the box, and Sandoval put away a right-footed strike.
 That, ultimately, was the final margin, though.
 Baker even pushed goalkeeper Danny DiFranco into the attack in the last five minute to help grab a second, but it wasn't to be.
 As Baker alluded, he was thankful to have a season at all. And after a 12-win campaign with a predominantly young side, he hopes for better in 2021.
 "So I would say this has been nothing but a tremendous success," Baker said. "As I talked to the boys, as we were just recapping the season for a few moments, we started this process, and this is our third year together. We've had a few years to play together.
 "We've worked on consistency and competition throughout every stage in that process, two words we emphasize day in and day out. And what we saw tonight was consistency, competition — yes, we made some mistakes. But we put together a 12-win season. The only words you could use are consistency and competition. The great part is we bring back six or seven people. We only had four seniors this year. The rest of them are all underclassmen. And so, we'll come back and we'll be better next year."

Last week, Chihuahua, which includes Juarez, became the only state in Mexico to return to its highest level health alert, or red, under which most nonessential services are shut down and people are encouraged to stay home.
 A curfew is also in effect in Juarez, but it has proved difficult to enforce in the sprawling city that is home to hundreds of factories that manufacture appliances, auto parts and other products around the clock.
 The U.S. and Mexico agreed months ago to restrict cross-border traffic to essential activity, but there has been little evidence Mexico has blocked anyone from entering. Other Mexican border cities have complained about people entering from U.S. cities that are suffering from virus outbreaks.
 Dr. Hector Ocaranza, the city and county health authority in El Paso, said the heavily Latino city's family-based culture has been a contributing factor in the spread. People under 40 are going to work and participating in other activities, then checking on older relatives and spreading the virus to them, he said.
 Those hospitalized are mostly over 60, but young adults make up nearly half of the total case count, Ocaranza said.
 Last week, the mayor of Juarez sent a letter to Mexico's foreign affairs secretary asking him to prohibit foreigners, especially Americans, out of concern that "indiscriminate crossings are contributing very actively to the spread of the virus."
 Mexico has reported at least 89,100 deaths from the virus, though authorities estimate 50,000 more probably died of it. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador decreed three days of national mourning for victims of COVID-19 coinciding with the Day of the Dead ceremonies starting this weekend.
 In the U.S., the deadly autumn surge that health officials have been warning about for months has been blamed in part on Americans tired of wearing masks and practicing social distancing, as well as the onset of cold weather that is forcing people indoors, where the virus can spread more easily.
 The average number of new cases per day in the U.S. has soared more than 40% over the past two weeks, from around 49,000 to about 70,000. Deaths per day have climbed from about 700 to almost 800.
 Cases are on the rise in every state but Hawaii, and deaths are up in 34 states. The states now seeing the highest rates of newly confirmed infections are mostly in the Midwest and the Plains.
 The virus has killed more than 225,000 people in the U.S. and infected over 8.7 million, by far the highest totals in the world, according to figures kept by Johns Hopkins University.
 In Newark, New Jersey, Mayor Ras Baraka is requiring nonessential businesses to shutter by 8 p.m. as the rate of confirmed cases of the virus reaches levels not seen since the spring. He also ordered restaurants to curtail indoor dining and mandated that beauty salons, nail salons and barber shops open by appointment only. Health clubs must close for sanitizing every 30 minutes.
 Milwaukee is reducing the maximum number of people allowed at indoor events to 10, and to 25 for outdoor gatherings. Authorities also restricted restaurant and bar occupancy to 25% for those establishments that don't have a city- approved COVID-19 safety plan. Dance floors are prohibited. Wisconsin in just the past seven days registered 64 deaths and more than 5,000 confirmed cases.
 In St. Louis, hospitals are filling up with coronavirus patients at an alarming rate, while about 250 miles across the state, Kansas City recorded its highest number of COVID-19 deaths over a one-week period, with more than 80 people dying.
 St. Louis-area hospital officials are begging people to take precautions to slow the spread of the virus.
 "Think about what this means to you and your family member, if you get sick," said Dr. Alex Garza, who heads the metropolitan area's task force. "Will there be a hospital to be able to care for you? Will they have space for your family member? Will the doctors, and the nurses and the techs be on top of their game, or will they be exhausted and fatigued?"

But it is not only the bankers’ Committee that the CBN has been collaborating with to tackle youth unemployment. For instance, on July 20, the apex bank coordinated with the fiscal authorities, especially, the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development (FMYSD), to introduce a N75 billion Nigerian Youth Investment Fund (NYIF), which is designed to improve access to finance for youth and youth-owned enterprises for national development. According to the CBN, the fund is primarily targeted at financially empowering Nigeria youth to generate at least 500,000 jobs in the country between 2020 and 2023. Eligible businesses under the programme, the banking watchdog said, are technology/ innovation; agriculture and related value chain; green economy and renewable energy sector; logistics and supply chain; manufacturing; hospitality/ tourism and construction. Others are creative sector, healthcare value chain, trading and services and as well as any other activity determined by the CBN itself and the FMYSD. The CBN further said that the global limit for loans under the fund was 12.5 billion, with a moratorium of up to 12 months, while the loan tenor and interest rate is a maximum of five years and five per cent per annum respectively. Shedding light on the NYIF at the inauguration of applications for the scheme recently, the Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Mr. Sunday Dare, explained that the Federal Executive Council on July 22, 2020 approved the NYIF to the tune of N75billion spread over three years to cater to youth owned businesses and investment needs, adding that the CBN, in line with the Federal Government’s directive, provided the initial N12.5billion required for the fund to operate in the remainder of 2020. Youths applying as individuals or non-registered businesses would be able to draw up to N250,000, while youth owned registered businesses could apply for up to N3million, he said. He noted that the NISRAL Microfinance Bank was selected as disbursement agency, given its reach and spread, which ensures that youths across the country had access to apply for the fund.

I make sure everything that is available gets collected and goes to the right place. It's a lot of computer science-type stuff."
   
 Elger played basketball as a kid. He was a wide receiver for the Richwoods football team. He picked up baseball at Richwoods because he wanted to play in more than one sport.
   
 Then-Richwoods baseball coach Dave Webb was bluntly honest with him.
   
 "He told me, 'I'll be honest with you, you probably won't play a whole lot,' " Elger said, laughing. "There's a time for everyone when you realize you aren't good enough to play. I wanted to stay in sports, work in sports.
   
 "So I started keeping the scorebook for the Richwoods games, and I'd go home and generate statistical reports for Coach Webb, and we'd send stats in to the Journal Star."
   
 And so began his path to the Rays, where he monitors the computer models that provide the data to a team of 8 to 10 analytics experts who help Tampa Bay evaluate players.
   
 Elger went on to earn duel bachelor's degrees in computer engineering and electrical engineering from the University of Missouri-Columbia. He earned a master's degree in data science at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay.
   
 Back in Peoria, he worked as an IT analyst for Caterpillar from 2014-17. Sports never left his mind, though.
   
 "Caterpillar was great, but I was always checking Fangraphs, which people in baseball use religiously," Elger said. "Halfway through grad school I saw a job posted there by the Rays, and I thought, 'The job description is literally what I do every day.'
   
 "A college friend had a contact with the Tampa organization and asked them to get someone to look at my application. They gave me a questionnaire with baseball and computer questions, which was easy. Then I had a phone interview, then they flew me down there and I won the job."
   
 This is Elger's fourth season with the Rays. In that span, the team has seen its win total increase each year, from 80 to 90 to 97 and now, in this COVID- shortened season, a win percentage that would have added up to 108.
   
 Elger was standing behind the batting cage at Tropicana Field in Tampa when superstar-in-waiting prospect Wander Franco delivered a moment that still makes the rounds in baseball lore.
   
 The Rays had brought in their top prospects in September of 2018 for a home run derby at Tropicana.
   
 Franco entered the final round down by 10. He had three minutes to hit.
   
 "I'll watch games with scouts all the time," Elger said. "I just don't see what they see. But that day, that moment, everyone could see it. He was 17, and in three minutes he hit so many home runs he won the event. He was down to 40 seconds left, and I think he hit three in his last four swings.
   
 "Randy Arozarena is another good one, we're seeing that in this World Series," Elger said of the player who was acquired from the Cardinals in a January trade, and now has nine home runs in 19 playoff games this fall.
   
 It's an up-close view for Elger, one he normally doesn't have.
   
 He and his fellow data colleagues have been working from home since March 11, when baseball shut down spring training and office sites because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 "We were told to pack up and leave immediately," Elger said. "It's impressive how our industry, a lot of industries, have adapted."
   
 And now here he is, on the inside of a Rays organization in the midst of a World Series.
   
 "They treat us very well," Elger said. "Our entire front office was put on a charter jet and flown to (Arlington, Texas), where we watched Games 1 and 2 at Globe Life Field (home of the Rangers). We're traveling with the team. It's so exciting."
   
 Back in Peoria, Elger's family is watching carefully, too. His mother and sister are Cardinals fans. He and his father are Cubs fans. That's a delicate calculation in a lot of households in central Illinois.
   
 But they are unified this week.
   
 "They sent me a picture," Elger said. "They were all wearing Rays gear."

Venturing into Georgia was a sign of confidence by the Biden team, which is trying to stretch the electoral map and open up more paths to the needed 270 Electoral College votes. The former vice president plans to travel to Iowa, which Trump took by 10 points in 2016, later in the week. And his running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, is hitting Arizona and deep red Texas.
 Besides Lansing, Trump was traveling to West Salem, Wisconsin. First lady Melania Trump was on the road, too, making her first solo campaign trip of the year in Pennsylvania. And Vice President Mike Pence was in South Carolina, maintaining his campaign schedule despite several close aides testing positive for the coronavirus last weekend. There, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham is in a potentially tight reelection race.
 Hillary Clinton flirted with GOP territory in 2016, only to lose traditional Democratic Midwestern strongholds. But a top Biden adviser rejected the notion that the campaign is spreading itself too thin, noting that the former vice president's visit follows weeks of paid advertising in Georgia and visits by Harris and the candidate's wife, Jill Biden.
 Biden will also visit in coming days Wisconsin, Michigan and Florida, where former President Barack Obama gave a speech in Orlando on Tuesday, blistering Trump as only worrying about the virus because it was dominating news coverage.
 "He's jealous of COVID's media coverage," Obama said. "If he had been focused on COVID from the beginning, cases wouldn't be reaching new record highs across the country this week."
 Trump expressed his displeasure that Fox News carried his Democratic predecessor's speech live, complaining to reporters about it and tweeting the network was "playing Obama's no crowd, fake speech for Biden."
 In Atglen, Pennsylvania, Melania Trump said she was feeling "so much better now," just weeks after being diagnosed with the virus. She slammed Biden's "socialist agenda," praised her husband as "a fighter," and also commented on the president's use of social media.
 "I don't always agree the way he says things," she said, drawing laughter from the crowd, "but it is important to him that he speaks directly to the people he serves."
 The Trumps left for their campaign trips at the same time, and the president gave the first lady a quick peck on the cheek before they boarded separate planes.
 The president will also visit Omaha, Nebraska, after a Sunday stop in Maine. That anticipates a razor-thin Electoral College margin since both areas offer one electoral vote by congressional district.
 While Biden rarely travels to more than one state per day, the Republican president has maintained a whirlwind schedule, focusing on his argument that he built a booming economy before the coronavirus pandemic upended it. Trump is planning a dizzying 11 rallies in the final 48 hours before polls close.
 His latest swing is also something of a victory lap after the Senate on Monday approved the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to give conservatives a commanding 6-3 advantage on the Supreme Court. Trump has sought to use the vacancy created by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg lo animate conservative evangelical and Catholic voters, though the high court fight has been overshadowed by concerns over the coronavirus with cases surging.
 Biden, meanwhile, is hoping to lift Democrats running for Senate in Georgia and Iowa. He was visiting Atlanta after his address in Warm Springs, where Roosevelt sought treatment while governing a nation weathering the Great Depression and World War II.
 "This place, Warm Springs, is a reminder that though broken, each of us can be healed," Biden said. "That as a people and a country, we can overcome a devastating virus. That we can heal a suffering world. That, yes, we can restore our soul and save our country."
 His appearance was meant to bookend his visit earlier this month to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, when Biden used the site of the bloody Civil War battle to issue a call for putting country ahead of party. On Tuesday, he evoked Roosevelt's New Deal sensitivities to say he could harness the power of the government to move the country forward.
 "If you give me the honor of serving as your president, clear the decks for action," he said. "For we will act."

Southern New England could get its first snow of the season late Thursday or Friday, according to the National Weather Service.
 Snow is possible in "interior" Southern New England, which in this case includes a section of Massachusetts.
 It's unlikely anyone will have to fire up the snow blower, but still, it was 76 degrees in Providence just last Thursday.
 "Did you hear it may snow on Friday?," the Weather Service says in its forecast discussion. "Yes, it`s true, Thursday night into Friday brings what is appearing to be our first shot at some wintry weather for the season. Exciting! However, it`s not at all cut and dry, nor is it a certainty."
 The two culprits are a low pressure system that will move here from the Southwest and the remnants of Hurricane Zeta, which will bring a lot of moisture as it lifts north from the Gulf of Mexico, according to the Weather Service.
 It's looking "more and more" likely they will come close enough to first bring "a soaking rain, then potential for a changeover to wet snow," according to the Weather Service.
 It's still difficult to say for sure whether anyone will see snow, according to the Weather Service, and the picture will become clearer by Wednesday or Thursday.
 "However, what we are fairly certain of at this point is that the Thursday- Friday timeframe will be wet and likely quite windy as well," the Weather Service says.
 Some areas could see an inch of snow, and while the precipitation is most likely in interior sections and at higher elevation, everyone isn't off the hook.
 "Colder air arrives behind the system Thursday night into Friday and depending on the timing this may even allow for some novelty snow flakes closer to the coast," the Weather Service says. "If this happens, would not expect any accumulation."

US Vaccine Chief Vows Not to Cut Corners as Pressure Mounts 1 Week Before Election

It was all so heartening that I developed a new interest in nature, which I’d always appreciated more as a passive observer. I volunteered at the adjacent wilderness park, became certified as a naturalist specializing in plants, wrote a hiking book.
 A little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing. As new understanding unfolded for me, I learned that fire ecology is a lot more complicated than “brush fire equals pretty flowers.” The spread of annual invasive plants, especially grasses, is so pervasive that after a fire, they tend to sprout up first, choking out annual native plants that take longer to make a comeback. True, the Tecate cypress, a rare tree that grows in one area covered in my book, can reproduce only when fire loosens its cones, allowing for the dropping of new seed. But it takes them 35 years to mature enough for that to happen, so more frequent fires could wipe out this population entirely.
 In general, a 35-year fire cycle is about right for much of our environment. More, and we stand to lose the plants and the animals that depend on them. Oh, sure, we can always grow more of the plants, but we’re now in a state of continual restoration. Make no mistake about what that means. It’s hard to re- create a self-sustaining environment when the invasive plants have taken over. It’s like we’re being forced to become the perpetual gardeners of many of our wilderness areas.
 My town is famous for being among the first to use goats to keep weeds down. They also keep down the native annuals, though, and spread the seed of invasive plants through their droppings. I’m never sure whether to be delighted or dismayed by the sight of the frolicking kids ― goat kids ― each summer in my canyon.

New parents shouldn’t have to choose between their careers and bonding with their children in the first few months of their lives. Paid leave programs improve child health, promote gender equality and keep women in the workforce. This is an idea that will strengthen the family unit and provide resources to America’s most vulnerable workers.
 According to a 2017 Pew Research Center survey, seven in 10 Americans support a paid family and medical leave policy, while 82% of those surveyed said mothers should have the option of paid maternity leave.
 With the GOP on board and a broad swath of the country supporting the idea, Congress must act to establish a minimum federal baseline for paid leave that would ensure all American parents receive some support when they take time off after childbirth. Along with California, eight states plus the District of Columbia have paid leave programs, which are funded through payroll taxes, something that should be considered on the federal level.

But the latest result will help paper over the cracks in what's been an inconsistent start to the season from Zidane's side.
 Madrid has gone from suffering a humiliating defeat at the hands of newly promoted Cadiz to beating fierce rivals Barcelona in La Liga this season and it was second best for much of Tuesday's match.
 It wasn't until Benzema's overhead finish that any sort of comeback looked likely.
 The goal sparked a frantic ending to the game with the hosts hanging on by a thread. Just as it seemed it had done enough to hold on, Casemiro was in the right place at the right time to break German hearts.
 Monchengladbach had chances to finish the game with the scores at 2-0, but will be left ruing the spurned opportunities.
 Alassane Plea had the best of the chances but his effort was thwarted by Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.
 "When you concede two late goals and drop the points it is not a good feeling," said Monchengladbach coach Marco Rose.
 "It came down to the quality of Real. We wanted to defend better until the end, but sometimes you need a little bit of luck and we didn't have that tonight."

I'm more dismayed than thrilled because I think the level of discourse has been lowered and that has lowered Hillary Clinton, too. She has gone from being frequently elected the most admired woman in the world to a trustworthy rating that is something like Richard Nixon's, because you have the false equivalency of a contest between two people, which means that all the objectivity requirements and habits of the press mean that you direct the same amount of negative questions to one as the other, and you try to treat them equally.

After five years of building preference points, we were finally off to Wyoming on an antelope hunt. Myself and five friends were off on our adventure. Anticipation of the hunt helped us survive the first eight hours of our drive. Looking at the antelope scattered across the plains helped pass the last five hours. They were literally everywhere we looked.
 Finally we made it to Unit 63 in high anticipation. Fearing poor weather we had rented a cabin. We got quite a laugh to find it a tiny little place that the six of us barely fit into. Luckily, with good friends, it is all part of the fun. I immediately called the couch, to get away from all the snoring in the common bedroom.
 We were not disappointed in the number of antelope. Over the course of three days we counted over 200 bucks. While we weren’t having any trouble finding antelope, we were having a hard time getting them to hold still. As soon as we poked our noses out of hiding, they were off and running. Their eyesight truly is amazing. It seems that no matter how sneaky we tried to be, they always managed to spot us.
 Most of the unit is pretty flat, making stalks a real challenge. Also, all of the bucks were of a type, 10 to 13 inches tall. We did see one or two that might have stretched to tape to 14 inches or so, but between chasing does and running from us, we couldn’t keep track of them.
 With so many antelope we weren’t too worried until it came down to the last day and we had nothing to show for our time. Fortunately, as often happens in hunting, things change fast.
 Tuck struck first when we managed to find a buck more interested in a doe than in us. A 120-yard shot with his .30-06 brought him down.
 Shortly after we quartered his buck and had it in the cooler, we crested a rise to find three bucks together, and I took the largest at 80 yards with my 6mm Remington. By the end of the day we had all tagged out on good bucks.
 After all of our long range practice, none of our shots were longer than 150 yards, which is fine with me.
 Before we had even recovered from the long drive home, my buddies were already planning a return trip.
