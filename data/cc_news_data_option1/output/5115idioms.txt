 Sarah Fuller became the first woman to score in a Power Five conference football game by kicking an extra point for Vanderbilt on Saturday.
 The goalkeeper for Vanderbilt's Southeastern Conference women's soccer champs didn't get a chance on the Commodores' first two drives against in-state rival Tennessee. But the Commodores drove late in the first quarter, running for a first down on fourth-and-1.
 On the next play, Ken Seals threw an 18-yard pass to Cam Johnson for a touchdown. Fuller, listed second out of three available kickers on the depth chart, came out for the extra point, which tied the game at 7 with 1:50 left in the first quarter.
 The 6-foot-2 senior put the ball through the uprights and celebrated by pulling her first in before slapping high-fives with teammates. She ran off the field with a big smile with her family in the stands all with their arms up in the air.
 An official gave Fuller the ball on the sideline.

LONDON (AP) — Anthony Joshua retained his world heavyweight titles with a ninth-round knockout of Kubrat Pulev on Saturday, potentially setting up an all-British fight against Tyson Fury to be undisputed champion of boxing's marquee division. Joshua had already knocked down the plucky but one- dimensional Pulev three times — twice in the third round — when he unleashed a right hook that sent the 39-year-old Bulgarian to the canvas once again. This time, Pulev couldn't get up and Joshua raised his right fist in the air. After months of boxing fights in empty British venues, up to 1,000 spectators — a limited number that included boxing royalty in Floyd Mayweather — were inside Wembley Arena to see Joshua make a successful first defense of the WBA, IBF, WBO titles since regaining them in a rematch against Andy Ruiz Jr. Now he has done away with the mandatory challenge of Pulev, Joshua can turn to his ultimate goal of being undisputed champion — the first in the heavyweight division since Lennox Lewis in 1999. He has an agreement in principle with Tyson Fury, the WBC champion, for a two-fight deal in 2021 to unify all four titles in an all-British blockbuster. It would be one of the biggest fights in living memory, certainly the biggest in British boxing history. “Since I came into this game in 2013, I have been chasing all the belts,” Joshua said. \"I have been dealing with mandatories. Of course I want the challenge — it's not about the opponent, it's about the legacy and the belts. “Whoever has got the belt, I’d love to compete with them. If that is Tyson Fury, let it be Tyson Fury.” Joshua's promoter, Eddie Hearn, was more direct, saying Fury was “the only fight to sign next.” “Since he (Joshua) came into my office, he wanted to be...

As the world finally sees the light at the end of the tunnel when it comes to the COVID-19 pandemic, there appears very dim light for the Palestinian cause. The only remedy for them is perhaps an urgent course correction by the international community, and the new liberal US leadership under President Joe Biden who must put pressure on Israel to halt all settlement building work and ask Israel to respect Palestinian rights. If that fails, then the international community should think about imposing sanctions on Israel. One thing is very clear: Palestinians have to dig in and fight.

Michal Menet and Will Fries stood near midfield wearing wide smiles. Isaac Lutz walked alone and looked up at the empty stands.
 Then they punctuated the celebration after their 39-24 comeback victory over Michigan State on Senior Day with a victory lap. With no one to cheer for them, not even their parents, allowed inside during the game because of COVID-19, it was a surreal scene.
 “It was the final lap, I guess you can say,” said Menet, the former Exeter star. “I’ve seen guys do it in the past. We were all talking about how fast it goes. We were talking about being on the seventh floor of Beaver Hall as freshmen.
 “We all share an incredible journey. It’s been tons of fun. I’m incredibly grateful. We’re going to love each other until the day we die.”
 They helped keep the Nittany Lions (3-5) together after the worst start in school history and beat the Spartans (2-5) for their third straight win. They’ll soon learn who and where they’re playing next weekend during Big Ten’s championship week.
 But they didn’t really care after they rallied from an 11-point halftime deficit and outscored the Spartans 29-3 in the second half.
 “You don’t let anybody come into your house, sit on your couch, eat a sandwich and think it’s going to be sweet,” Toney said. “I think everybody came in the locker room at halftime, calmed down, fixed some things and made adjustments.
 “The second half showed what kind of team we are.”
 Freshman quarterback Payton Thorne shredded the Penn State secondary and led Michigan State to a 21-10 lead at halftime. The Lions looked like a different team on offense and defense in the second half.
 They opened the third quarter with a 75-yard drive that Sean Clifford capped with an 8-yard pass to freshman Parker Washington. Clifford then found Jahan Dotson for a two-point conversion that cut it to 21-18.
 Later in the third, the Spartans moved in position to take at least at 10-point lead, gaining a first down at the Penn State 4. Connor Heyward slipped on a first-down run; Jonathan Sutherland tackled Thorne for a 1-yard loss; and Simmons broke up a pass at the line.
 Michigan State settled for Matt Coghlan’s 23-yard field goal and a 24-18 lead, but not reaching the end zone changed the game’s complexion.

HONOLULU (AP) — Hawaii prison officials said an additional 63 inmates and six staff members have tested positive for the coronavirus at a state prison. The outbreak has left 68 inmates and 21 staff members infected with the virus at the Halawa Correctional Facility in Oahu, Hawaii News Now reported Friday. There are 936 inmates at the facility, all of whom are now being tested. A lockdown has been instituted in the facility that suspended all inmate movement and blocked transfers to and from the prison. The quarantine will last for at least two weeks. “HCF immediately enacted its pandemic protocol to isolate these inmates and begin mitigation efforts,” said Max Otani, the state Department of Public Safety's director. “Our security and medical staff are working around the clock to safeguard staff and inmates and keep the virus from spreading. I am so proud of everyone at the facility for their dedication to pulling through this situation as a team.” This is the third major outbreak at a Hawaii prison since the pandemic began. The Oahu Community Correctional Center has had 449 inmates test positive for the virus while the number of inmates infected with the coronavirus at the Waiawa Community Correctional Center in Waipahu is over 200. More than 600 Hawaii inmates have also tested positive for the virus at a privately owned prison in Arizona. The number of infections is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some — especially older adults and people with existing health problems — it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.

“The crucial thing for defenses these days is not giving up touchdowns,” Toney said. “It’s something we didn't do our best at this year. In the red zone, we have to stand up. Three points is a whole lot better than seven.
 “We put them in a whole different mindset. Who knows how that game ends if we give up a touchdown there?”
 Penn State proceeded to break it open by scoring three touchdowns in less than four minutes.
 Backup quarterback Will Levis, attempting passes for the first time in three weeks, fired a strike to Dotson for a 36-yard gain before Clifford returned and found Washington for 26 yards. That set up Levis’ 1-yard run that gave the Lions a 25-24 lead with two seconds left in the third.
 A few minutes later, Clifford faked a short pass to Dotson and threw to a wide-open Washington for a 49-yard score. Washington finished with four catches for 95 yards.
 “Parker’s a great talent,” Dotson said. “He has all the intangibles to be a great player. It’s so cool to watch him because you know you were in his shoes. Now he’s a veteran. He’s making plays every day, Saturday specifically. He showed his talents today.”
 Then Dotson did, returning a punt 81 yards for a touchdown that made it a 15-point game with 11:24 to go. He broke one tackle and then sprinted down the left side of the field behind a cadre of blockers.
 “The punter outkicked the coverage,” Dotson said. “One rule we have is never let the first guy tackle you. I made him miss and my teammates gave me a lane. I got through it to the end zone.”
 On offense, Dotson finished with eight receptions for 108 yards. Clifford missed open receivers in the first half, but he was much better in the second half and finished 17-of-27 for 232 yards and two scores. Levis completed all three of his attempts for 54 yards.
 On defense, Simmons made seven tackles, including two in the backfield and 1½ sacks, in place of injured end Jayson Oweh.
 Coach James Franklin told Steve Jones and Jack Ham on Penn State’s postgame radio show that he “set off some explosives” at halftime.
 “I didn’t really say a whole lot to them,” Franklin said later. “It’s about corrections. It’s getting everybody on the same page with how they’re trying to attack us offensively and defensively and making subtle adjustments that we needed to make.”
 Now they have a three-game winning streak as they await for their opponent next week. It’s been a remarkable turnaround.
 “Guys just started to invest and try to get better every day,” Menet said. “Maybe in the beginning of the season, we had too many individuals. We didn’t buy in enough to our culture and our process.
 “We’ve now put some good games together and built momentum. It was awesome to get a win on Senior Day.”

 # Kickapoo knows it's talented. After a comeback win over Cardinal Ritter, it knows it has fight
 Wyatt D. Wheeler
 Springfield News-Leader
 ROGERSVILLE — In the locker room at halftime, Kickapoo head coach Mitch McHenry told his team that it needed to get a "kill."
 A kill is three stops in a row.
 The Chiefs needed it. They were down 12 against defending Class 3 state- champion Cardinal Ritter and the Chiefs were coming off an emotional loss to Greenwood just the week before.
 "We needed to get three stops to give ourselves a chance," McHenry said. "And we did that."
 Shortly into the second half, the Chiefs got those three stops and turned them into three-straight Anton Brookshire buckets. The stops continued and Kickapoo tied the game at 38 just over two-and-a-half minutes into the third quarter.
 "That was just us putting our heads together and standing together," Brookshire said.
 Kickapoo continued to make the plays it needed as it pulled off a 64-62 nailbiter against Cardinal Ritter on Saturday afternoon at Logan-Rogersville High School.
 Brookshire, a Mizzou signee, alongside Missouri State signee Isaac Haney made the unselfish, winning plays to keep the Chiefs from falling too far behind.
 Haney scored 10 points in the first quarter while keeping the Chiefs just within reach. Brookshire's offensive spark in the third quarter brought his team back.
 "We said 'just because we're losing, it doesn't mean we're out of the game,'" Brookshire said. "All we had to do was stay together and keep fighting and keep fighting."
 After the Chiefs came back to tie the game, the two state-championship contending teams went back-and-forth.
 Kickapoo rallied from another seven-point third quarter deficit, but rallied back and tied the game when a Trevon Brazile board led to a Brookshire assist in transition to a wide-open Haney who hit a triple at the thrid-quarter buzzer.
 "I play to win," Brookshire said. "I'm going to make the right reads — whether that's scoring, passing. We have a great group of guys on this team, so whenever I see them open or I see where I could help a teammate out and put them in the best position as possible, I'm going to do that."
 Brookshire and Haney's heroics continued into the fourth quarter. Haney ended the game with 24 points while Brookshire added 21.
 Cardinal Ritter featured a deep team with plenty of length and athleticism. The roster inclduded five-star college football prospect Luther Burden — who is committed to playing at Oklahoma and is the No. 11 overall player in the Class of 2022, according to 247Sports — who scored 20 points.
 Back-and-forth play went throughout the fourth quarter until Brookshire split a pair of free throws with 31.3 seconds remaining.
 Cardinal Ritter turned it over at the other end before sending Haney to the free throw line to split his while takin a 64-62 lead with under five seconds to go.
 Cardinal Ritter came up empty and Kickapoo pulled off a win that confirms it is among the state's elite.
 "I feel like today, we found out that we can fight," Haney said. "Everyone knows on paper there's a lot of talent but I don't feel like in those first three games that talent had any fight and I think today, we found that talent found its fight."

The aftermath of these diplomatic agreements has been the Palestinians being left high and dry. For decades they have been fighting for the two-state solution, but first it was Britain to betray them through the Balfour declaration of 1916, then the Sykes Picot Agreement, followed by the formation of Israel in 1948 with utter disregard for the rights of the Palestinian people. These agreements have not only alienated Palestinians who are almost facing an existential crisis but also point to a deeper schism within the Muslim world.

Goshen would cut the deficit to 11 a minute later, but that is as close as the RedHawks would get to St. Joe the rest of the game. The Indians took a 16-point lead into the fourth quarter and then opened the frame on an 11-0 run, pulling ahead by 27 and putting the game on ice.
 Although he struggled to score against the much larger Indians team, Goshen junior guard Drew Hogan would finish with 11 points and nine assists, the latter of which was a season high.
 “Drew’s a smart player,” Wohlford said. “He’s a competitive kid; he knows what to do and how to make the right plays. He’s just a great teammate. He’s found his mojo … we need other kids to get to his level because he’s a great player.”
 Hill ended up leading the team in scoring with 16 points. While the sophomore has relied on the 3-point shot most of the season, Wohlford was happy with how more aggressive Hill played on Saturday than in the first three games.
 “I thought his effort was a little better in all areas of the game,” Wohlford said. “He rebounded better. He even fouled a couple of times because he was playing hard, which is a huge sign for him. He’s a sophomore, so we’re developing these kids. I’m happy with Deecon not just because he shot well, but because he did some other things.”
 Rounding out the scoring for Goshen was Bechtel with nine points, senior Isaac Sawatzky and junior Zach Subera with four points each, senior Blak Wiess with two and junior Brandon Rivera with one.
 The RedHawks (0-4) host South Bend Clay on Tuesday.
 “Every game has to be a learning experience,” Wohlford said. “You can’t leave any game behind. You have to take something from it, win or lose. Unfortunately, right now, they’re losses. But we’ve played great teams and there should be a ton of teaching and learning points within every game. I hope we show some improvement Tuesday.”

 Minnesota’s defense, which was worst in the country at 7.7 yards per play, held Nebraska to 2.3 in the first quarter. To start the second, their issues resurfaced with Wan’Dale Robinson busting off a 47-yard touchdown to set up a touchdown that cut into Minnesota’s lead at 10-7.
 But they kept Nebraska in check of the most part, allowing only 4.7 yards per play.
 The U’s defensive problems continued in allowing a 13-play 73-yard drive and relinquished the lead at 14-10 midway through the second quarter.
 With less than three minutes left, Gophers running back Cam Wiley broke off a 61-yard run. But Minnesota’s drive stalled in the red zone.

Real Madrid reignited their La Liga title push on Saturday beating leaders Atletico 2-0 as their city rivals suffered a first league defeat of the season.
 Real, who salvaged their Champions League campaign in midweek by making the last 16, moved to third in the table, three points behind Atletico.
 It was a disappointing night for Diego Simeone's side who had boasted a 26-match unbeaten run in the league, stretching back to February.
 That was a run which consisted of 17 wins and nine draws. Real had been the last team to beat Atletico in the league.
 "We confirmed the improvement we showed in many areas against Sevilla and Borussia, and gave another good display," said Real coach Zinedine Zidane, reflecting on his side's wins in the past week which have helped turn around the season.
 "There are criticisms that hurt, but they also make you stronger."
 "We competed very well from minute one until the end, we must be satisfied with work well done."
 His team were in front after 15 minutes when Casemiro headed home a corner from Toni Kroos.
 That was reward for Real's early pressure which had seen Karim Benzema denied by a fine save from Jan Oblak moments earlier.
 Atletico, who also made the Champions League knockout round in midweek, struggled to make any impression and star striker Luis Suarez was an anonymous figure up front.
 Real went 2-0 up after 63 minutes with Kroos again the provider.
 His pass eventually fell for Dani Carvajal who unleashed a 30-metre drive which hit the post but was diverted into the net by the helpless Oblak.
 The 'keeper was credited with an own-goal for his troubles.
 It was only the fourth goal conceded by the usually water-tight Atletico defence in 11 league games this season.
 \- 'That hurts' -
 It was a night of frustration with Simeone's men managing just one shot on target.
 "We didn't have the courage to attack, now we have to work and improve."
 "They were better. They were forceful, precise, and when they had their chance, they put them away," said the Argentine.
 "We can have a bad game, we can. That hurts, yes it hurts."
 Egos too were hurting.
 Portuguese star Joao Felix showed his displeasure at being replaced by Saul on the hour.
 Suarez allowed himself an ironic smile when he too was benched in favour of Geoffrey Kondogbia in the 73rd minute.
 "Joao Felix, if he plays, he wants to contribute more, he wants to finish the 90 minutes," said Simeone.
 "But I can't explain his behaviour."
 In stark contrast, Zidane could be especially pleased for Casemiro who had returned from Covid-19 quarantine while Carvajal had recovered from a right leg injury.
 It was a night to remember also for captain Sergio Ramos who was playing in a Madrid derby for the 43rd time,
 Atletico, meanwhile, could lose top spot on Sunday when second-placed Real Sociedad welcome Eibar.
 Barcelona are also in action on Sunday against Levante and will be under intense scrutiny.
 Barca are in such disarray that they need a victory merely to steady the ship after a morale-sapping 3-0 defeat to Juventus in the Champions League.
 The Catalans still qualified for the last 16, but as group runners-up Lionel Messi and his teammates risk drawing one of Europe's big names.
 After the tumultuous summer which almost saw Messi depart, Barca and new coach Ronald Koeman never seem to have recovered.
 They sit an unaccustomed ninth in the table with just 14 points from 10 games. They are 12 points behind leaders Atletico.
 Goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen said a win against modest Levante, who have just three points fewer than the Catalans, was essential.
 "In La Liga we are not where we want to be but we can claw back some points and that is the aim in the next few weeks.
 "We're playing at home and we can't afford to drop a single point now."

Salina Central's Aubrie Kierscht was nearly perfect Friday night against Salina South.
   
 The Mustang junior matched a career-high with 32 points on 12 of 14 shooting and hit all six of her 3-point attempts in leading Central a 67-39 victory over its crosstown rival at the Central gym to improve to 3-0.
   
 "For me, honestly, I just wanted to keep attacking, and showing what I can do," Kierscht said. "My teammates (kept) finding me, and that's how I keep knocking down (shots). They trust me."
   
 South (0-3) made things tough for Central in the opening stages of the game, forcing seven lead changes before Kierscht scored the final five points of the first quarter to give the Mustangs a 15-12 advantage.
   
 The Cougars closed within four on two occasions in the second period, but Central began to pull away and led 28-19 at halftime.
   
 "We knew they were going to play really hard," Central coach Chris Fear said of South's performance in the first 16 minutes. "They played a little bit differently defensively than what we've seen so far. It took us a half to get adjusted to it.
   
 "I thought in the second half, we relaxed a little bit and started playing, and things came to us."
   
 South managed to break the Mustangs' press, but still trailed by nine at halftime. The Cougars went 0 of 4 from the free-throw line, which didn't help their cause.
   
 "We got to the rim (and) the foul line a couple of times late," South coach Ryan Stuart said. "We were right there at the end of the second quarter, and a lot of it was because of how they handled the ball, and I think we missed four free throws there before the half.
   
 "That's where we lost the game."
   
 Central began the second half with a 10-0 spurt and never looked back.
   
 "For us to go the other way gave us a lot of momentum, confidence and energy," Fear said.
   
 Beside Kierscht, the Mustangs got 14 points from sophomore Mykayla Cunningham and a team-high nine rebounds from junior Landry Stewart. Central shot 48% from the field in the game.
   
 South, which was missing point guard Acacia Weis, got nine points from Sydney Peterson, while Kylie Arnold added eight points and four assists. Elena Herbel and Kalysa Hamel also had eight points each.
   
 "I thought Syd and Kylie did great," Stuart said of his guards. "Their effort was really, really good."
   
 South resumes Ark Valley Chisholm Trail League Division I play next week with a pair of home games. The Cougars will host Maize South on Tuesday and wrap up the pre-Christmas schedule against Hutchinson on Thursday.
   
 Meanwhile, Central will hit the road for the first time, traveling to Arkansas City on Tuesday and Andover Central on Thursday.

Shibuno, going for her second major in as many years, was at 4-under 209 and headed for the practice range to sort out her driver, staying there until the fading sun cast long shadows.
 "I myself was very nervous," she said. When asked why a major champion with an endless smile and seemingly not a care in the world would be so nervous, Shibuno replied, "Because I was on top of everybody, that's why."
 And she still is. Just barely.
 Moriya Jutanugarn, playing in the same group as her two-time major champion sister, Ariya, was right in the mix until she bladed a bunker shot to the back of the 17th green and three-putted for a double bogey. She still managed a 72 and was three behind, among only four players who remained under par.
 The other was Ji Yeong Kim2 of South Korea, who was on the opposite end of the Cypress Creek course. Kim2 made the cut with one shot to spare and shot a 67 -- one of only two rounds under par -- that moved her into a tie for third. Kim finished by chipping in for birdie on the par-5 ninth hole.
 Shibuno is trying to become only the third player to make majors their first two LPGA Tour titles. The others were In Gee Chun (2015 U.S. Women's Open and 2016 Evian Championship and Se Ri Pak, who won the LPGA Championship and U.S. Women's Open in 1998.
 Shibuno won the Women's British Open last year at Woburn, and declined to take up LPGA membership because she didn't think she was ready. Now her only way to join the LPGA is to win on Sunday, and it doesn't figure to be easy.
 Eight players were separated by four shots going into the final round, a group that includes Lydia Ko (72) and Texas senior Kaitlyn Papp, who played in the final group with Shibuno and held her own until dropping two shots over the last three holes for a 74. They were at even-par 213, along with 19-year-old Yealimi Noh (72) and Megan Khang (74).
 Jin Young Ko, the No. 1 player in the world and a two-time major champion, made 16 pars in her round of 71 and that was enough to at least give her a chance. She was at 1-over 214 with Women's PGA champion Sei Young Kim (73).
 All of them had to contend with a course that played 6,635 yards and felt even longer because of heavy rain Friday after the second round ended. More than length was mud that gathered on the golf ball in the fairway. That creates problems for Champions because of its enormous greens.
 Asked about the mud, Olson laughed and replied, "Which one? There were about 18 of them."
 "At one point I laughed and it was like, 'Is it going to be in a divot or a mud ball?' Because it was one or the other pretty much all day," she said. "So I'm really hoping that we either do lift, clean and place or it's so wet tomorrow that the water just pulls the mud off."
 She delivered her best shot on the 17th, hitting an 8-iron -- the same club, the same type of shot for her hole-in-one in the opening round -- that came inches away from going in. The tap-in birdie and a solid par on the last puts her in the last group as the 28-year-old from North Dakota tries to win for the first time.

HOUSTON (AP) — Hinako Shibuno passed a big test Saturday in a classic U.S. Women’s Open that put a premium on par, keeping the lead with a 3-over 74 going into a final round at Champions Golf Club that figures to be the toughest of all.
 Shibuno led by four shots when she made her lone birdie on the par-5 fifth hole, and then it was a matter of hanging on for dear life on a rain-softened course that made it tough to control shots with splatters of mud on the golf ball.
 She bogeyed the final hole from a bunker and her lead was down to one shot over Amy Olson, who nearly holed out from the 17th fairway and shot a 71 that felt much lower.
 Moriya Jutanugarn, playing in the same group as her two-time major champion sister, Ariya, was right in the mix until she bladed a bunker shot to the back of the 17th green and three-putted for a double bogey. She still managed a 72 and was three behind, among only four players who remained under par.
 The other was Ji Yeong Kim2 of South Korea, who was on the opposite end of the Cypress Creek course. Kim2 made the cut with one shot to spare and shot a 67 — one of only two rounds under par — that moved her into a tie for third. Kim finished by chipping in for birdie on the par-5 ninth hole.
 Shibuno was at 4-under 209 as she bids to become the first player since Se Ri Pak in 1998 to win majors for her first two LPGA Tour victories. Pak did it a few months apart in 1998. Shibuno won the Women’s British Open last year at Woburn, and declined to take up LPGA membership because she didn’t think she was ready.
 Now her only way to join the LPGA is to win today, and it doesn’t figure to be easy. With rain in the forecast, the USGA has moved up starting times as early as possible, with the first group starting at 7:45 a.m.
 Eight players were separated by four shots going into the final round, a group that includes Lydia Ko (72) and Texas senior Kaitlyn Papp, who played in the final group with Shibuno and held her own until dropping two shots over the last three holes for a 74.

When it was open to public comment I expressed my concern for our children and how the current data does not support keeping children out of the classroom; math test scores are declining while depression, anxiety, and child abuse are on the rise. There are no playgrounds to play on, no sports happening, so children are also suffering physically. (Taking a walk around the neighborhood just isn’t the same as school PE or running and climbing around the playground.) Was there any concern at all from the Board of Supervisor’s or the Public Health Officer regarding these children? Any personal accountability? No. The overall response was that the schools were to blame for not opening up while we were in the red tier (Wasn’t that a two week window?) and it had nothing to do with them.


--DocBreak--
So, this seems to be quite contradicting. The County blames the School Board, the School Board blames the County Health Officer… and then you have the Teacher’s Union who puts a grinding halt to any progress given to getting kids back in the classroom. Per the same UUSD board member, “The California Teachers Association has opposed any form of reopening schools from the beginning. They do not care about the health and welfare of our kids or community. Their only goal is to protect the worst members of their union. This poses a problem. When the District says that it's time to go to school, there are a variety of ways teachers can opt-out. We simply do not have enough substitutes to weather the storm.” So, the Teacher’s Union is dictating whether our children get a classroom education. Meanwhile, teachers are getting a three percent pay raise, half of them are refusing (aka “opting out”) to go back to the classroom, and they can’t be fired.
