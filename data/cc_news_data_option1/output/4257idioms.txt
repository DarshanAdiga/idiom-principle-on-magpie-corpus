Nate Silver, editor of the FiveThirtyEight polling website, recently produced a list of suggestions for how people could “stay sane” over the next few weeks. Some of them seem counterintuitive from the point of view of Democrats’ mental health. Tip No. 2: “Don’t assume the race is in the bag for Biden.”

“Nos mostraron su dolor y fue un decir 'esto no es sustentable' porque los food delivery sirven para la primera orden y captar al primer cliente, pero no para retenerlos porque se pueden mover de un restaurante a otro.
 “Salimos a buscar más clientes para saber si era un problema local o mundial y fue muy fácil comenzar a vender. El problema más grande que tenían los restaurantes no era la página web no era el marketing, sino que era la última milla y que era la principal razón de por qué tomaban las otras aplicaciones. Entonces, fue el momento que nosotros agregamos el servicio de logística con nuestros repartidores y eso cambió el estatus a un producto mucho más completo”.
 Gracias a la incidencia de su producto, Rodrigo y Nicolás fueron aceptados en febrero de este año en la prestigiada aceleradora YCombinator de la cual han egresado emprendimientos como AirBnB, el procesador de pagos Stripe, y el mismo Rappi.
 El apoyo de YCombinator, así como la explosión de servicios de e-comerce generada por la pandemia llevó a Justo a trabajar con mil restaurantes en Chile, un crecimiento de 14X y a multiplicar su fuerza de trabajo.
 “Pasamos de ser una empresa que no existía a una que concentra 20 por ciento del mercado (del e-comerce de comida). Y con eso fue que decidimos también ir a probar a nuevos países que tengan culturas gastronómica ricas como México, en cualquier lado encuentras un restaurante de comida mexicana”.

It’s hard to overstate the degree of anxiety in America right now as the country confronts a Hydra of troubles: the pandemic, the economy, the fires, the protests, the violent plots against public officials, the assault on voting rights, the state-sponsored disinformation, the sense that democracy itself is on the ballot.

Apologies to the purists: the "Third Saturday in October" rivalry between No. 2 Alabama and Tennessee actually falls on the fourth weekend of the month. But it's one of the few games that remained in its original spot when the Southeastern Conference ripped up schedules and switched to a 10-game, league- only setup because of COVID-19 concerns. No one will give the Volunteers a shot -- oddsmakers installed them as 21-point home underdogs -- after consecutive drubbings at Georgia and against Kentucky that prompted Jeremy Pruitt to fire defensive line coach Jimmy Brumbaugh. But Tennessee led the Bulldogs 21-17 at halftime and would have had a better shot against the Wildcats if not for four consecutive turnovers, including two interceptions returned for touchdowns, in the first half. And last year in Tuscaloosa, the Vols settled for two field goals in the red zone and trailed 28-13 in the fourth when Jarrett Guarantano fumbled at the goal line. Trevon Diggs recovered and took it 100 yards the other way for a game-sealing score that gave the Tide its 13th consecutive victory in the series. Maybe Tennessee will have better luck Saturday since Alabama is coming off the SEC's final game featuring undefeated teams in 2020.
