  Hollywood returned to Marblehead last week, bringing movie magic without much mayhem for local businesses.


  "It was much better than I worried it might be," said Gene Arnould, of Arnould Gallery and Framery at 111 Washington St., which closed on Wednesday, Jan. 22, when Disney+ was filming in the neighborhood. "It went almost flawlessly. The cleanup was amazing… much, much better than over the summer."


  Several business owners worried about the impact of another movie shoot closing local streets and keeping out customers, especially after last summer's filming of the Adam Sandler movie, "Hubie Halloween."


  Sandler and his production team came to town in July and turned a portion of Washington Street into a Halloween-scape and The Hotel Marblehead into a haunted house.


  The shoot was supposed to take one week, but stretched into more than a month.


  The Disney+ shoot, however, was much quicker -- just one day.


  "They shot when they said they were going to shoot and the clean-up was done well," said Sam Pollard, owner of Mud Puddle Toys at 1 Pleasant St.


  The new movie, "Godmothered," tells the story of a young, unskilled fairy godmother played by Jillian Bell who, according to The Hollywood Reporter, "ventures out on her own to prove her worth by tracking down a young girl whose request for help was ignored."


  The young girl, however, is now a woman, played by actress Isla Fisher. In a twist on the classic Cinderella tale, she is looking for more than a Prince Charming.


  To create a Christmas scene, crews sprayed fake snow across Washington Street and decked out local buildings in holiday decorations.


  Several local businesses, including Mud Puddle Toys, posted photos from the set on their social media pages.


  Arnould says Old Town has become a genuine hub for Hollywood movies. He praised the Board of Selectmen's decision to not immediately green light the movie producer's request to shoot in town, but to table it for one week.


  Arnould said that gave the movie people time to go out and do their "due diligence" with local businesses. A week later, the board reconvened and approved the request.


  "I hope the selectmen use this as a model for future proposals, having a waiting period between the initial presentation of the request and a week or two delay," he said. "See that it gets done right."


  "Godmothered" is directed by Sharon Maguire, who also directed the Bridget Jones movies. There is no release date yet.

The team was on their way to compete in the 2016 Copa Sudamericana Finals before the accident, which killed 71 of the 77 people on board. The cause off the crash was said to be fuel exhaustion, due to a shoddy flight plan by the airline, and the pilot’s failure to declare an emergency and alert air traffic control after fuel levels became low.

“We must heed the warnings science is giving us,” Murphy said of Rutgers University studies finding that sea level could rise as much as 1 foot by 2030, 2 feet by 2050 and 6 feet by 2100.


  Sea level rise is already “eroding the shore economy,” Murphy said, with frequent flooding and damage to beaches. Further sea level rise is inevitable up to 2050, because of carbon already in the atmosphere. But changes made in emissions of greenhouse gases could lessen sea level rise in the second half of the century, he said.


  “It’s hard for future generations to create Jersey Shore memories if the Jersey Shore itself becomes no more than a memory,” Murphy said.


  The New Jersey Conservation Foundation’s Tom Gilbert called the plan a “game changer — a new direction from the previous administration that puts the state on exactly the right path we need to be on ... (moving) away from fossil fuels and towards building a clean energy future.”


  Ed Potosnak, executive director of the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters, praised the tighter building rules.


  “Gov. Phil Murphy ... is putting New Jersey at the forefront of climate action by requiring developers to consider their environmental impact before they build,” Potosnak said.


  But New Jersey Sierra Club Director Jeff Tittel said the plan still consider some types of incineration and bio-gas as clean energy.


  Tittel also said it will take so long for the regulations to be finalized, many fossil fuel projects currently in the planning stages may be built before the plans regulations are done.


  PACT stands for Protect Against Climate Threats, and it will include drastically cutting emissions of greenhouse gasses and other climate pollutants, and transform land use and planning policies to adapt the state to threats from sea-level rise, extreme weather and chronic flooding.

HINGHAM -- A man accused of shooting at SWAT officers from his barricaded Hingham apartment during an hours-long stand-off with police was held without bail on Monday and ordered to have a mental health evaluation.


  Pharaoh Yahtues, 37, of Hingham was arraigned in Hingham District Court with more than a dozen charges including nine counts of armed assault with intent to murder and possession of an explosive. Yahtues was held without bail pending psychiatric evaluation at Bridgewater State Hospital, a medium- security facility that typically houses pre-trial detainees sent for competency and criminal responsibility evaluations by the court and civilly committed defendants.

  Judge Heather Bradley also ordered a dangerousness hearing for Yahtues after his Bridgewater evaluation to determine if he poses a danger to the public. A request by Plymouth County prosecutors to revoke bail on Yahtues on a pending arrest warrant out of Plymouth County Superior Court was continued to a later date. Yahtues is due back in court on Feb. 18.


  Police said that Yahtues is a Level II sex offender with a "violent history" in police reports filed with court about the Saturday stand-off at a Hingham apartment complex. Police said incident started with Hingham officers investigating a domestic violence call, escalating into Yahtues barricading himself in an apartment, shooting at police and throwing a quarter stick of dynamite at assembled SWAT officers. During the stand-off a victim also had to be rescued from the third-floor apartment using a firetruck later.


  No one was hurt during the hours-long standoff at an Avalon apartment building near Hingham Shipyard. Yahtues gave himself up peacefully just before 1 p.m. after hours of speaking with police negotiators. This incident drew a large-scale police response and media presence.


  Yahtues was brought into a Hingham District Court at about 8 a.m. on Monday, yelling to reporters that he didn't do anything, but it would be hours before he was arraigned. In that time, Yahtues spent about 90 minutes with a court psychologist, Dr. Nichloas Petrou, who testified that Yahtues was competent to stand trial, but may have issues understanding his own criminal responsibility.


  Petrou said that Yahtues detailed to him a life of time behind bars beginning as a youth.


  "He stated he hasn't learned to live outside of incarceration," Petrou said, describing at least 16 years in various prisons, including in the state's most secure wing at the Cedar Junction state prison in Walpole.


  Police said that Yahtues is a convicted felon with a history of assaults and no license to carry a gun. He was wearing a GPS monitoring device on probation from court, which he cut off and hid during the stand-off.


  Police responded to the the apartment building on Saturday at about 6 a.m. and found a two women and two children who had come from the third-floor apartment, and said that Yahtues had a gun and was inside the partment with another man who lived there. Police accuse Yahtues of punching and choking one of the women that morning and shoving her into the walls of a closet. Police said Yahtues also pistol-whipped the other woman. Hingham Police said officers went to the the apartment to try and get Yahtues out, but heard him beginning to barricade himself in.


  Police said he threatened to shoot officers through the walls and made statements about "suicide by cop."


  The man trapped in the apartment also called 911, and said he locked himself in a bedroom and feared for his life. Police then began evacuating the building and Metro-LEC SWAT was called. Metro-LEC is a regional collaboration of 46 law enforcement agencies in the Boston area that pools resources for a SWAT, or specialized weapons and tactics, team. Police from across the region responded to the incident with armored vehicles and drones.


  A reverse 911 call was sent to residents in the area advising them to shelter in place and to stay away from windows.


  Members of the SWAT team used a Hingham Fire Department ladder truck to reach the third-floor bedroom to rescue the victim.


  Sometime after the rescue, Yahtues fired a gun at SWAT members who were inside and near an armored vehicle. He did not hit any officers. Yahtues also tossed a quarter stick of dynamite onto a patio of the building, but it didn't go off. Police said that Yahtues stuck a cell phone out of the apartment to get videos and pictures of officers, so he knew where to shoot.


  A crisis negotiation team spent several hours talking to Yahtues, and eventually he surrendered just before 1 p.m. Police said the standoff lasted about three hours.


  After Yahtues was arrested, a State Police bomb squad searched the apartment, deeming it safe, and neighbors were allowed back into their homes. Hingham detectives obtained a search warrant and found a semiautomatic pistol hidden in a ceiling vent of the apartment, police said.


  In addition to armed assault with intent to murder for a number of first- responders, Yahtues was also charged with domestic assault, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, strangulation, two counts of discharging a firearm within 500 feet of building, possession of an firearm without a license, possession of ammunition without a firearms identification card and two counts of malicious destruction of property.

The death of NBA icon Kobe Bryant loomed over the build-up to the Super Bowl here Monday as Kansas City Chiefs players paid tribute to the Los Angeles Lakers legend.


  One day after Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter and seven others were killed in a helicopter crash outside Los Angeles, the build-up to Sunday's Super Bowl in Miami cranked into gear.


  Both the Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers teams were due to be presented before thousands of journalists and fans in the now circus-like "opening night" event that formally kicks off Super Bowl week.


  But the festivities at Marlins Park began on a somber note, with a moment's silence observed as a giant screen displayed a photo of Bryant.


  Chants of "Kobe! Kobe!" rang out towards the end of the brief pause before numerous members of the Chiefs roster shared their memories of the five-time NBA champion.


  Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes said although he had never met Bryant, he continued to be inspired by his famously ferocious competitive spirit.


  "I wasn't lucky enough to meet Kobe but the impact he made in my life was huge," the 24-year-old told reporters.


  "The work ethic, that intensity that he had to be great every single day.


  "Even to this day, I still watch videos on YouTube the day before games, just listening to him talk, how he puts everything into perspective being great on and off the court."


  Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, who had met Bryant, described the fallen NBA star as an "unbelievable person."


  "You can't say enough about who he was and his impact," Kelce said. "I just feel bad for the Bryant family, everybody involved. My heart's with you and everyone here in America."


  Chiefs safety Tyrann Mathieu admitted he was still struggling to comprehend news of Bryant's death.


  "Shocked and sad," Mathieu said. "I thought guys like him lived forever."


  Bryant's death hit home for Chiefs coach Andy Reid, the respected NFL veteran who grew up in Los Angeles.


  Reid had also become acquainted with Bryant during his long association with the Philadelphia Eagles. Bryant was born in Philadelphia.


  "It's sad," Reid said. "I knew Kobe from Philly, and he was a great person. I feel bad for his family, sick for his family.


  "They'll rebound. They're strong. They'll live up to his strength."


  Defensive end Chris Jones, meanwhile, said the tragedy had underscored the fragility of life.


  "Anybody close to anyone on that helicopter lost someone yesterday that was important to them," Jones said. "It just shows you how precious life is.


  "As soon as I heard the news I had to call my kids to tell them I love them, because we take those opportunities for granted."

When I found out the reports were correct, I was floored.


  The suddenness of his passing hit the world like a rock, tore us deep, made us think about how fragile life really is.


  His on-court accomplishments were incredible. Five-time champion, 18-time all-star, lock for Hall of Fame enshrinement, his legend is carved in stone.


  But what made the Los Angeles Laker staple a legend was his drive.


  His “Mamba Mentality” is something that transcends the game he loved. It applied to everything he did in his life and it’s a lesson that us lucky enough to walk this earth can take with us.


  He’s an inspiration for anyone who has a dream and doesn’t know how to make it happen. Don’t take “no” for an answer, don’t make up excuses, just work for what you want in life and you can make it a reality.


  He showed us if you work to be something, that grind will eventually bear the fruits of your labor.


  The man wasn’t perfect, but the way he came back from those down periods, showed the mantle of his character.


  We all wanted to be like Kobe. I’m sure there are countless amounts of kids in Rutland County that wanted to be like him. I know as a young boy in central Massachusetts, I certainly felt that way.


  We tried his patented fadeaway jump shot in our driveways. We grew up yelling his name when we threw up a shot or any time we tossed a crumpled up piece of paper into a trash can across the room. He inspired us all.


  Looking at his four daughters and his wife Vanessa, you can see the man he was and he loved them dearly.


  Kobe Bryant was robbed of his second act. The beginnings of that script had the ink drying, but never got past the opening pages.


  Gigi could have taken center stage in that second act, the starring role.


  She was on her way to play in a basketball tournament when her untimely death came. She was supposed to be the the heir apparent to the Bryant basketball legacy, one started by her grandfather Joe and taken to the skies by her father Kobe.


  Her jump shot was smooth, her passing was crisp, she was the future.

The luxury helicopter that crashed Sunday morning in California, killing all nine people on board including former NBA star Kobe Bryant, was once owned by the state of Illinois.


  The Sikorsky S-76B helicopter was built in 1991, according to the Federal Aviation Administration's aircraft registry. The state of Illinois used it from 2007 to 2015, according to helicopter information database Helis.


  Under the direction of former Gov. Bruce Rauner, the state sold the helicopter along with four other surplus aircraft in 2015 for $2.5 million. Rauner said selling the aircraft "also avoided an additional $1 million in inspections and repairs," according to an Associated Press story after the sales.


  The winning bid for the helicopter was $515,161, placed by user "Jimbagge1," according to a listing on the state's online auction website, iBid. Both the aircraft and its two engines had just under 4,000 hours of airframe time when the copter was sold.


  At the time of the crash, the registered owner of the helicopter was Island Express Holding Corp of Van Nuys, California, which registered it a month after it was won at auction.


  The state of Illinois previously attempted to sell the helicopter in 2014, but received zero bids, according to that auction's iBid listing.


  A public information officer at the Illinois Department of Transportation, which maintains state aircraft, did not have any available information regarding the helicopter or its uses for the state.


  The copter's information page on Helis, however, labels it as "VIP Governor."


  A public information officer for the governor's office also did not have available information. A PIO for the Illinois Department of Central Management Services, which operates iBid, did not immediately respond to a request for more information.


  Sikorsky is a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin, an American defense contractor.


  Bryant, 41, played for the Los Angeles Lakers from 1996 to 2016. He won five NBA championships, the Most Valuable Player award in 2008 and appeared in 18 all-star games.


  One of his four daughters, Gianna, 13, was also killed in Sunday's crash. Bryant also leaves behind his wife of 18 years, Vanessa.

Last week, Nairobi was finally granted hosting rights for the 10-meeting World Athletics Continental Tour in a decision that will most certainly transform Kenyan sport.


  The May 2 Nairobi meeting -- the only African stop on the tour -- joins nine others on the 2020 roster, namely Tokyo (Japan, Asia, May 10), Nanjing (China, Asia, May 13), Ostrava (Czech Republic, Europe, May 22), Hengelo (Netherlands, Europe, June 1), Turku (Finland, Europe, June 9), Kingston (Jamaica, North America, June 13), Szekesfehervar (Hungary, Europe, July 7), Silesia (Poland, Europe, September 6) and Zagreb (Croatia, Europe, September 15).


  That Nairobi joins the elite "Gold level" meetings, ahead of several other well-heeled competitions appearing lower down on the "Silver level" schedule, such as the famous ISTAF Berlin, goes to show the confidence that World Athletics President Seb Coe and his team in Monaco have placed in Kenya's organisational acumen.


  Also, that Nairobi hosts the opening leg of the new series builds pressure on Athletics Kenya and the Ministry of Sports who both lobbied intensely in Monaco last November to have our capital city considered as the African stop of the new series that's in the second tier of global competitions, just a rank below the iconic Diamond League Series.


  Credit must go to Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed for fighting to offer, in the nick of time, the requisite government guarantees for Nairobi to get the Continental Tour leg, especially at a time that the ministry's management was at sixes and sevens owing to a huge rift between the Cabinet Secretary and her now redeployed Principal Secretary, Kirimi Kaberia.


  It was a major coup considering that the well-endowed cities of Los Angeles (USA) and Durban (South Africa) were waiting in the wings, bidding for the same competition.

Fish & Game commissioners must be confirmed by the Senate, and Stennett said when she discovered that Melton, who was up for confirmation, had voted as a registered Republican in the last three primary elections, she alerted both the Department of Fish & Game and the governor’s office.


  “There isn’t a single Democrat on the Fish & Game Commission,” Stennett noted. “I did tell them, ‘Try to at least follow the statute.’ I don’t think people are unqualified, but we should do what the law is telling us to do.”


  Among other major state boards and commissions that are required by law not to be dominated by a single party is the state Tax Commission, which according to state law, “shall consist of four members, not more than two of whom shall belong to the same political party.” That rule for the Tax Commission also is specified in the Idaho Constitution, which states in Article VII, Section 12, “There shall be a state tax commission consisting of four members, not more than two of whom shall belong to the same political party.” The current tax commission includes two Democrats, both of whom previously held partisan elected office.


  Numerous other state boards and commissions have similar requirements in state law, including the Idaho Transportation Board; the Idaho Water Resource Board; the Commission for the Blind & Visually Impaired; the Public Utilities Commission; the Board of Health & Welfare; the Commission of Pardons & Parole; the Judicial Council; the Board of Correction; the Board of Environmental Quality; the Board of Parks & Recreation; and more.

In 1851, some 450 Latter-day Saints -- Mormons -- were sent by their church from Utah to establish a colony in what we call the Inland Empire. Within several years, the settlement's population skyrocketed to more than 3,000 -- at least as big as, if not bigger, than Los Angeles.


  The pioneers plotted a town, established a municipal government and created the separate county of San Bernardino. To transform arid land into a thriving agricultural settlement, the Saints exploited dozens of enslaved African Americans that they had brought with them from Utah, as well as an untold number of coerced Native American laborers.


  Slaveholders occupied the upper echelons of the Mormon hierarchy in San Bernardino. According to U.S. census data and the records of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the colony's co-founder and its bishop owned slaves. One of San Bernardino's high counselors, Robert Mays Smith, did too. In fact, Smith claimed 14 enslaved women and children, making him the largest slaveholder in the continent's Far West.

It’s not often people learn they have an unexpected $818 million heading their way.


  But that’s essentially the situation facing Wisconsin legislators after the state’s Legislative Fiscal Bureau released a new projection late last week estimating that state government will take in $818 million more in tax revenue than previously projected in the 2019-21 state budget.


  State law requires half of the amount exceeding budget estimates to be deposited into the state’s rainy day fund, but that still leaves an estimated $452 million, after adjusting for changes in costs and interest earnings, that could be used in multiple ways.


  The announcement prompted a variety of proposals from Chippewa Valley lawmakers for what to do with the excess revenue, ranging from cutting taxes or paying down debt to spending the money on mental health initiatives, juvenile corrections reform, broadband expansion or aid for struggling farmers.


  While Republican leaders who control the Legislature immediately began discussing an election-year tax cut, GOP lawmakers from west-central Wisconsin said they were open to that proposal but also had other ideas about how the money could be deployed.


  Rep. Romaine Quinn, R-Barron, said he doesn’t think it’s appropriate to plan significant new government spending outside of the regular budget process, so he advocated just leaving the money in the state’s general fund or using it to pay off debt early.


  “If you get a bonus at work, you probably don’t go buy a new truck,” Quinn said. “We found money we didn’t know we had, so why not pay the bank what we already owe.”


  State Sen. Kathy Bernier, R-Lake Hallie, said she is pleased the new revenue estimates will result in significant payments to the state’s rainy day fund.


  “It’s a matter of time until we hit a recession — that’s economics 101 — so we will need more money in that fund to lessen the cuts when revenues are reduced,” Bernier said.


  However, Bernier also has a local project in mind that she thinks would be a good way to spend some of the surplus not earmarked for the rainy day fund. She plans to propose that the state pay to remove old, unused, fenced-off buildings from the grounds of the former Northern Center for the Developmentally Disabled in Chippewa Falls.


  Other possibilities include funds to add mental health beds or address homelessness, she said.


  Regional Democrats had their own ideas about how to use the unexpected windfall.


  Rep. Jodi Emerson, D-Eau Claire, said the money offers a good opportunity to make some one-time proactive investments that could save the state money in the long run, such as addressing the youth mental health crisis, building new juvenile corrections facilities or pursuing projects to solve the affordable housing shortage.


  “It’s like a house. What kind of prevention work can we do to stop a huge problem and expense we might have down the road?” Emerson asked, adding that the money offers a chance “to invest in our state because that will make it a better place for people to live, work, play and go to school.”


  Sen. Jeff Smith, D-town of Brunswick, said the Legislature should invest the state’s budget surplus back into rural communities to provide partnership opportunities and mental health resources for farmers and to expand rural broadband access through initiatives included in the ‘Better Broadband’ bill package he introduced Monday.


  “It’s time we take this approach to ensure Wisconsinites in all corners of the state have equitable access to opportunity and success,” Smith said.


  The region’s other Democratic state senator, Patty Schachtner of Somerset, also expressed support for renewed investment in rural communities, possibly including support for family farms, broadband access, natural resources, mental health care and general health care access.


  Schachtner’s office provided a list of 18 bills addressing those issues that spokeswoman Sarah Smith said, if enacted, would cost only a small percentage of the overall budget surplus.


  Rep. Warren Petryk, R-town of Pleasant Valley, said the surplus shows Wisconsin is on the right track but wasn’t ready to commit to a specific plan for the money.


  “It is too early to say how the funds should be used, but we need to be cautious to not use the funds to grow the size of government, and look at ideas to return the surplus to the hard-working taxpayers of the state,” Petryk said.


  Likewise, Rep. Rob Summerfield, R-Bloomer, said he could support reinvesting the money in northwestern Wisconsin, setting it aside in the rainy day fund or returning it to taxpayers.


  “I’m open to anything that would help our area,” Summerfield said, citing funding more mental health beds in the Chippewa Valley and aid for farmers as possibilities he could get behind.


  Several lawmakers acknowledged much discussion will be necessary between Democrats and Republicans before a plan is devised for the surplus.


  “This is a negotiation,” Emerson said. “This is what happens with shared government.”

  On a hike with Boxford Police Chief Jim Riter from the sanctuary entrance near 200 Middleton Road to the top of Bald Hill, Chris and I marveled at the long beaver dam that has reshaped Crooked Pond by flooding trails and widening the wetland area.


  When Riter was a kid, they'd come up here with a bucket of shiners and fish for bass and pickerel.


  "We were running around here as kids long before there were any sign markers," he said.


  Back then, there were fewer deer and more birds. Blue jays and blue birds would be everywhere, Riter said, and you'd see pheasants, too.


  However, we were rendered almost speechless (and that's saying something!) when we discovered that James Russell, who died in 1830 at age 77, fought in the Revolutionary War. A low wall of stones surrounds the graves.


  Although the burial ground is now in Boxford State Forest, it is still maintained. The American Legion places a flag here every year, Riter said. You can see that at some point, someone may have scribbled something on Russell's gravestone, but it was cleaned off.


  "It has to be kept because there's a veteran here," Riter said.


  The prayer on James Russell's stone reads:


  Cease then mourner cease to languish


  O'er the graves of those we love


  Pain and death and night and anguish


  Enter not the world above


  And let me choose the path they chose


  That they I soon again may see


  Beyond this world of sin and woes


  With Jesus in eternity


  When we arrived at the top of Bald Hill, it was very quiet, just a lone cardinal peeping from a tree before flying off. It's covered in grasses, but there are paths going off in many directions down into the forest that surrounds it. You can see the area where people used to ride horses.


  When he was a kid, Riter said, there were places nearby where they'd go out at dusk and watch the male woodcocks perform their courtship displays. The woodcock is a round bird with short legs, a long bill, and brown-black-rust coloring that enables it to hide in the leaf litter.


  "In the springtime it comes out when it's mating season," Riter said. "It would come out of all the ground cover. It would fly up about 40 feet, make its calls and then divebomb right down to the ground."


  As they come down to the ground, their wings make a whistling/fluttering sound, and when they land, the woodcocks make a nasally "peent" call.


  "Then they take off, go straight up, make the sound and then drop back down, trying to find a date," Riter said.


  "Somebody finds that sexy," Chris said.


  You can hear more of our conversation with Chief Riter when our podcast drops on Thursday evening. Stay tuned.

Elliott's 11-year-old daughter Kaylee Barlow said she will miss the centre.


  "I came to the centre every day because a lot of my friends were there and it was really fun," Barlow said. "We got to play games, do programs, go skating, eat, socialize."


  The community association will vote on whether the centre can keep using the space on Tuesday at 7 p.m. at the former Albert Park location.


  Gray hopes people in the neighbourhood will come to the meeting and make their voices heard.


  "If they see value in services like this, they need to communicate to the community association," Gray said.


  Global News reached out the community association several times for comment but did not receive a reply.

The fast increase in the number of injectable drugs that are to be approved in the recent times has been a crucial contributor towards the growth in demand for disposable syringes particularly, as opposed to other types of syringes. This is owing to the rising number of patients who have been afflicted with needle stick injuries accidentally. Both the factors thus work in tandem so as to create a staggering demand for disposable syringes and are expected to continue doing so in the long run.

Some Davenport School Board members have been saying they wanted a new motto for months or years. Monday night, they got one — and a new logo, to boot.


  No longer is Davenport a “District of Distinction.” They’re “Growing Excellence.”


  When the board in September approved outsourcing communications and marketing to TAG Communications, branding through graphic design and a new corporate identity, or logo, were a large part of TAG’s plan.


  The logo, designed by TAG Vice President of Design Services Brian Buckles, features a color palette that includes the colors of each of the nearly 30 schools in the district, as well as a design that references each of the letters in "Davenport."

If Tesla announced such a plan, it would make the interwebs enthusiastic. In my opinion, the Audi initiative deserves the same level of enthusiasm. Unfortunately I think that is out of the question because the news broke about 10 days ago and I barely noticed it a few days ago and almost missed it.

The House managers have said that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. should be asked to decide. But while the Senate rules say the chief justice “may rule on all questions of evidence,” they also make clear a majority of senators can decide for themselves, including by overruling the chief justice.


  Philbin’s comments about “compromise” and “accommodations” suggest the White House may favor a middle option in which, for example, Bolton could testify but only behind closed doors before the Senate. This could be justified as a means to protect national security and confidentiality while allowing the senators to hear Bolton answer questions under oath.


  Later this week, the Senate is expected to turn to the question and a vote on whether to call witnesses.

Kromah missed the free throw, but the Trojans got the rebound and missed and got the rebound again and missed. Six seconds remaining, down by two, Kromah had another shot – a long three-pointer that would have won the game. But he missed and the Panthers took the championship. Afterall, it was a real game, not a movie script.


  It is the second week in a row the Panthers had won the trophy. Last week they won the Ponderosa Classic at Monroe, beating Albany Middle for that title. The finish the season with a 16-4 record.


  Melvin Chambliss led the Panthers with 15 points on the night after scoring only two in the first half. James Adams was next on the scoring list for the Panthers with seven points and Trevion Richardson added six.


  Kari Laster led the Trojans with 16 – 12 of which came during that fourth quarter rally. Loronzo Still scored 10 and Kromah added seven.


  A photo gallery from the championship games will be on AlbanyHerald.com.
