Four batters in against the Orioles and it was already 3-0, thanks to a home run by Renato Nunez off the Big Mermaid. They'd have a 5-2 lead after two innings, as Jurado only slightly improved in the second. The next two innings were okay, but giving up a couple of hits in the fourth doomed him. The Mets actually tied it in the 6th thanks to Andres Gimenez's first major league home run (mere seconds after Gary mentioned that Oriole Park was conducive to home runs. But then the guy that most everyone else wanted to start this game, Franklyn Kilome, set the game on fire in the bottom of the sixth by giving up an RBI double to Pat Valaika and a two run homer to Anthony Santander. Nunez then hit his second home run of the game in the 7th to put the cherry on top of the castor oil.

Jimmy and Jey Uso have had no shortage of quality and entertaining matchups during their current 10-year run in WWE. During their recent appearance on Table Talk With D-Von, The Usos discussed some of their favorite opponents to work with outside of New Day.
 "The Bar," Jimmy said. "Sheamus and Cesaro were a hell of a tag team and to start off as two singles and be merged into a tag team and people actually get behind them, they started to have that aura of a tag team. They were my favorites, jumping in with those guys. The Revival, too. We never actually got a chance to finish that story and keep going with those guys. We never got to open the box with them, but I would love to. Everybody's got good chemistry, but it's hard to follow New Day."
 "There really aren't any other tag teams left," Jey added. "I guess we haven't crossed paths with Street Profits yet or The Vikings, really. These are kind of new tag teams that are coming in now and we are in the game. I hope they're ready, because they're about to have to step way up. The Usos, that's what we do and we like to set the bar. I'm excited about the tag teams. It feels so weird saying these are all younger homies, but they are. We're about to be 35 on Saturday."

The Usos contemplated their 2 out of 3 falls match and mentioned it was their favorite of their career until the Hell In A Cell match with New Day. They went into who they'd like to have another 2 out of 3 falls match with and the answer was surprising.
 "Honestly, they're not a tag team anymore," Jimmy said. "It would Luke Harper and Erick Rowan. We had one 2 out of 3 falls match and it was my favorite of my career. Hands down my favorite match until the Hell In A Cell with New Day came along. That's my favorite one now just because of the history in that match. The only tag team Hell In A Cell match and all the greatness that went into that."
 "Just walking down to the cell," Jimmy continued. "I could feel every - my dad [Rikishi] - I watched him get thrown off by Undertaker, so my family's been there. The greats - The Rock, Stone Cold, Triple H, just everybody. That energy is crazy! I wish everyone in the world could experience and feel that stuff. It's something you can't even explain. Magic is going down."
 Jimmy continued on how special it was for him to participate in that match and reflected on watching his dad walk down to the cell and wishing he could see things through his eyes in that moment.
 "Those were major hitters," he continued. "I'm in this business now and see where I'm at and look back and see where my dad was and my family, it gives me goosebumps. They were the ones. It made a difference coming in here because The Usos, it was a slow start for us to find out who we were."
 The reflection continued on when they discussed what it was like meeting Randy Orton for the first time and what wisdom he shared to help them find their own identities.
 "I remember Randy Orton spitting the realest 'ish' my first year when we came in," Jimmy said. "I remember him saying, 'You all are going to do good in here. It took me about 6 years to really find out who Randy Orton was. You will find yourselves. Just hang in there, work hard, stay humble and you'll find yourselves.' and I remember not knowing what he was talking about, then it resonated on me. Still growing in this business and still learning every day about this business."

Unfortunately, forums that discuss the efficacy of various ballistic helmets tend to be dominated by US nationalists and gear snobs, which makes it hard to identify honest reviews of cheap equipment, especially foreign-made options. Yet the cheapest source for new, ballistic-rated helmets (especially helmets with all the bells and whistles) is China. Many manufacturers claim that they offer US quality at China prices, and we’ve found that “cheap” Chinese “knockoffs” often perform similarly to American models.

 I am shocked that school is starting again in September.
 I am even more surprised that they have chosen to start classes earlier in the morning for my teens. Anyone with a teen knows that earlier in the morning does not work well for them.
 I'm currently grappling with what's right for my family given the pandemic and I'm questioning why we would go against biology and start classes earlier, not later for our teens.
 I was very thankful that Algoma University made the choice to keep all classes online this fall, so that I would be teaching online and not in the classroom. I assumed that the elementary and secondary school boards would follow suit. Yet it seems that kickstarting the economy involves schools being open, doubling as daycare for kids, so that parents can work.
 Both of my kids have asked to go back to school this year. (Wow -- there is so much wrong with that sentence; COVID-19 has made the world so very weird.)
 My kids are not thinking about the economy, nor should they be. Not surprisingly, they want to go back to some form of normalcy. I'm the cautious one, wanting them to wait this out until the new year to see how this massive health experiment goes.
 I don't blame the kids. After all, why wouldn't kids want to go back to school? My daughter misses the school musicals, and my son misses sports. Sadly, neither will have either through school in September as no extra- curricular activities are allowed.
 The kids want to once again sit in the cafeteria and eat with their friends. That is not allowed either. I get that they are probably tired of our circle of ten's faces, and can't wait to see other kids. I also know it will be a relief for them to go back to class and have a teacher right in front of them to answer questions on the spot, instead of their online learning experiences (which varied from excellent to passable by teacher and course).
 Then Mayor Christian Provenzano calls out the Minister of Education saying that our schools aren't ready. While I don't blame him, and I even applaud him, this does not induce confidence in me to send my kids back. I pity the teachers, who are also being made guinea pigs in this mammoth experiment. They are being asked to do something that has never been done before, with little guidance ("Just fold in the cheese David." (My Schitt's Creek friends will understand that reference)). None of this is normal, nor fair, but this is the new normal. I only hope that teachers are given the resources they need to do their jobs safely.
 Tell me though, why does the new normal have to start a half hour earlier? I'm assuming it's a busing issue, but why not half an hour later, so that teens can get the sleep that their brains and changing bodies require? Why not have the elementary school kids go to school earlier? If my family is any example, the "youngins" were all awake at the crack of dawn anyway.
 I'm at a loss. September is always a time of change, but 2020's version is particularly dubious. All I know for certain is that there are a lot of uncertainties.

Warped Wing Brewing Co. has opened its new barrel-aging facility, pilot brewery and restaurant in Springboro.


   


  The 20,000-square-foot Warped Wing Barrel Room & Smokery opened Saturday (Aug. 29) and includes an outdoor beer garden. The facility has enough space to hold more than 400 barrels, along with serving as a brewery and distribution hub.


   


  The Dayton-based Warped Wing also is launching special customer program such as a Barrel Club Reserve membership which will allow people to get hands-on tours, exclusive tastings and first offers for limited bottles.


   


  "Our barrel-aging program has propelled us into an interesting place," cofounder Nick Bowman said in a prepared statement. "My partner, cofounder and brewmaster John Haggerty has a wealth of knowledge and experience with brewing and barrel aging. He pushes the creativity of recipe development to another level. Barrel aging is an intimate and patient process. A lot of our beers rest in wood for up to a year or longer. We are excited to share this process and experience with our customers. The Barrel Room & Smokery will take beer to a new level and will change the way people perceive and interact with beer. That is what I'm most excited about."


   


  The pilot brewing system also will allow Warped Wing to experiment, he added.


   


  The Smokery, run by Culinary Director Erin O 'Neill, will focus on smoked meat/food items and many of the dishes will feature Warped Wing beers as ingredients, the brewery said.


   


  The new brewery will be open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Thursday; 11 a.m. to midnight Friday and Saturday; and 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday.

I would characterize a legitimate bear case against the company as based more on EIF's size and operational scale more than on the company itself - the company itself has posted "too good" results to be the victim of all that much fundamental doubt, as I see it. The contextual risk compared to larger, safer companies, however - that's a part of the bearish thesis I can actually get behind and, at least in part, agree with.
 Whether it makes the company uninvestable for a conservative dividend investor, that's a different thing and one investors would have to decide themselves. Bears would say yes.
 I would say no.
 ## Thesis
 Investing in smaller-scale companies always comes with a significant amount of risk and uncertainty. The businesses are far more volatile and trade at completely different multiple patterns than we may be used to from investments in mega-cap corporations.
 I own a few companies in Scandinavia that fit the bills as "small" companies - one of my financial/bank holdings has a market cap of under $900M, but I'm always more comfortable and confident investing in companies I have in my backyard.
 EIF certainly isn't in my backyard - it's across the pond, thousands of kilometers away. Rules are different. Over the course of the past 2 years, I've carved away most of my smaller holdings in favor of investing at lower- yield but far safer holdings with excellent growth prospects. The ultimate ambition of my portfolio as I currently see it is about a $1M portfolio yielding between 4-5%. At this point it would be able to fund my life based only on dividends wherever I would choose to live, provided I also still do what I consider "fun" (as in, work). As such, every investment until that goal is ultimately reached, is with that goal in mind.
 Exchange Income Corporation is the only holding I would consider "small" left, in my entire NA portfolio. I view the reasons for this as very good. The company has excelled fundamentally during the time I've owned it and continually proven able to handle changing market environments. The leadership navigates with skill, and with these latest trends during the worst pandemic in 100 years, this company has proven itself worth the spot in my conservative investor's portfolio.

Traffic on Poonamallee High Road near Vanagaram was disrupted on Wednesday morning as several flower merchants took to the roads with complaints of losses in business and a lack of facilities in the temporary market.
 Several wholesalers who were allotted space in the Vanagaram temporary market dumped flowers at the market as a mark of protest. It may be recalled that the market started functioning on August 20 at a site belonging to the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department.
 While nearly 230 shops were allotted at the four-acre site, about 500 merchants who were earlier functioning in different parts of the city had also gathered there for trade. Wholesalers also alleged that there was no transparency in the rent collected from them.
 Arul Visuvasam, a wholesaler said the site lacked basic amenities and there was a risk of the spread of COVID-19 at the market as safety norms, including physical distancing, were not followed. The market was overcrowded. “Many merchants had already settled in various parts of the city as smaller groups. We now have to bear more than 50% losses after setting up shops in Vanagaram without any basic facilities,” he said.
 Fruits and vegetable markets were allotted temporary space in Madhavaram and Thirumazhisai immediately after the Koyambedu market, which turned into a COVID-19 hotspot, was closed. “Several merchants were forced to move into the Vanagaram market and had to bear with severe losses,” said A. Manohar, another wholesaler.
 Merchants demanded that they be allowed to continue their trade from various parts of the city like earlier, until the flowers section in Koyambedu wholesale market is reopened. They dispersed after the Maduravoyal police held talks with them.

"Rather, the ‘dual circulation’ slogan is an attempt to have it both ways: for China to gain more control over its long-term growth without losing its role as a central hub in the global economy.”
 Pushing consumers to drive more growth has been a core policy for over a decade now and had been showing some success, with consumption comprising an average 64 percent of gross domestic product in 2016-2019, up from 54 percent in the previous five years.
 However, the fallout from the pandemic and the resulting contraction highlighted weakness in consumption, with retail sales shrinking for the first seven months of the year as people buy less due to lockdowns and lost income or jobs. That’s meant the main drivers for growth in 2020 have once again become government stimulus spending, investment and exports.

Milwaukee learned its B game wasn't enough to beat the Heat on Monday.
 The Bucks hit reset after a Game 1 loss to the Miami Heat and look to even the Eastern Conference semifinals series at 1-1 on Wednesday night.
 "It wasn't a bad game," Bucks guard Kyle Korver said. "It was a B. If you want to win in the playoffs, you've got to get an A."
 The Heat broke away late for a 115-104 victory over the Bucks in Game 1 on Monday night, with Miami star Jimmy Butler vastly outperforming Milwaukee Most Valuable Player candidate Giannis Antetokounmpo.
 Miami opened the postseason last month in a similar manner, dispatching of the higher seed -- No. 4 Indiana -- 113-101 in the best-of-seven opener.
 The Heat took control of the series by duplicating their success in Game 2, winning 109-100 en route to a four-game sweep and is 5-0 in the 2020 playoffs.
 Milwaukee, meanwhile, was stunned 122-110 by eighth-seeded Orlando in their first-round opener two weeks ago.
 The Bucks regrouped to immediately turn the tables on the Magic, romping 111-96 in Game 2 to tip off a sequence of four double-digit wins.
 Goran Dragic had 27 points, Bam Adebayo notched a double-double with 12 points and 17 rebounds, and Andre Iguodala helped spearhead a team defensive effort against Antetokounmpo. It was Butler's postseason career-high 40 points that made the biggest difference in the Heat's opening win over the Bucks.
 Afterward, Antetokounmpo, recently voted the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year, was asked if he had volunteered to guard Butler.
 "No, I didn't. Why would I do that?" he questioned. "I'll do whatever the coach tells me to do."
 Both teams exhausted numerous fouls on the other team's standout. That also worked in Miami's favor.
 While Butler shot 12-for-13 at the free throw line, Antetokounmpo suffered through a 4-for-12 night.
 Miami outscored Milwaukee 25-14 from the line in the 11-point win.
 Butler credited a team effort for the win.
 "It's not about just scoring," he professed. "It's about guarding. It's about making the right play, getting the 50-50 ball. That's all part of winning the game."
 Antetokounmpo also had a poor night at the line in the Game 1 loss to Orlando, going 4-for-9. He rebounded to go 7-for-8 in Game 2 as part of a 28-point, 20-rebound double-double.
 The Heat limited Antetokounmpo to 12 field goal attempts in the series opener. It was his fewest shots since taking 10 in a loss at Boston in Game 5 of their first-round series in 2018.
 Antetokounmpo fired up 23 shots in his next game that time, scoring 31 points in a win.
 Milwaukee went without guard Eric Bledsoe in Game 1 due to a strained hamstring. His status for Game 2 is to be determined.
 The Bucks outshot the Heat overall (49.3 percent to 46.4) and on 3-pointers (45.7 percent to 38.7), but took nine fewer shots than Miami. Nineteen Bucks turnovers and 12 Heat offensive rebounds contributed to that disparity.
 Antetokounmpo was harassed into a game-high six of the turnovers.
 Adebayo, meanwhile, had six of Miami's 12 offensive rebounds, one shy of the Milwaukee team total.
 Khris Middleton with 28 points and Brook Lopez with 24 were the Bucks' top scorers in Game 1.

Beginning your first head coaching job at a new school is not an easy task, but Logan Fritz has embarked on an even taller challenge as he takes over Pleasant Ridge football in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 The Rams are coming off a 3-6 season under former head coach Pat McCollim and will attempt to capitalize on a strong group of returning players as well as a new scheme.
   
 Fritz said taking over the program and installing his schemes has been more challenging than it would normally be but the staff and athletes adjusted well to the new guidelines.
   
 "Trying to install a new offense and defense with zero contact camps or scrimmages has not been easy," Fritz said. "Even though Leavenworth County has had a bunch of positive cases, the area where we are at hasn't had that many. We started a week later in the summer than what KSHSAA said we could in order to keep our protocol in order. We were able to still have summer weights every scheduled day, we just moved weights outside the weight room to keep the kids safe."
   
 He said gathering his team has been challenging at times because of the jobs his athletes work during the summer.
   
 "We have a bunch of kids that work summer jobs, I'm not talking about a summer job sitting in the air conditioner either," he said. "They are either building pools, in a hayfield or on a tractor out in the heat all day. Because of that, the kids are worn out at the end of the day.  My staff understands that and I embrace as well as encourage it. I know the kids on our team are not going to be scared of hard work."
   
 The Rams return senior quarterback Connor Gibson as well as senior running back Jake Heckman, who averaged nearly five yards per carry last season.
   
 "Not only is (Gibson) one of the best athletes we have on the team," Fritz said, "but his ability to read and make decisions is better than most of the quarterbacks I had at the college level."
   
 Fritz said he has been encouraged by how Justin Johnson, Chase Wohlgemuth, Devin Stutz and Luke Silvers have picked up the new scheme. He also mentioned Zach Nichols, Cole Keller, Walker Adams and Trevor Roemer as players that could take big steps in their development this season.
   
 "We will spread the ball around more this season than has ever been done in past years," Fritz said. "Teams that play us will have to cover the whole field."
   
 On the defensive side of the ball, Fritz said Mason Hawk, Gavin Van Dyke, Adian Williams and Nate Wilburn are a handful of players he expects to make an impact immediately.
   
 He also noted that there are a number of underclassmen who have shown flashes throughout the summer and could find playing time with the varsity team.
   
 "I'm excited to see all the younger kids develop because there are some other guys that are going to really start to stand out as the year goes on," he said.
   
 The Rams are scheduled to open their season Sept. 4 at home against Jefferson County North. Fritz said he is confident the team will be able to play its first two games before any games will have to be postponed due to the pandemic.
   
 "I have been telling our kids that we will more than likely get to play the first game because it is before we start school," he said. "If both us and Atchison County can make it through the first couple of days of school, we will probably get to play the second game. After that, it's up in the air in my opinion."
   
 Kickoff for the Rams' season opener is scheduled for 7 p.m. Sept. 4.

Riverside lost one opponent, but landed a new one.
 A day after the Hanover Area school board reversed course and decided to allow fall sports, the Vikings filled a vacant week in their football schedule, again, as the shuffle continues as schools deal with competitions amid the coronavirus pandemic.
 Riverside, which agreed to play three teams from the Wyoming Valley Conference after Hanover Area originally canceled fall sports last Thursday, will still play at Wyoming Area on Sept. 11, and now will also play at Tamaqua, a District 11 team, on Sept. 25.
 As a result of Hanover Area’s flip-flop, the Vikings lost Holy Redeemer on Sept. 18, leaving them with seven games. They are the only team from the Lackawanna Football Conference playing games ahead of the agreed upon Oct. 2 start by the members of the Lackawanna Interscholastic Athletic Association.
 “We knew coming in that nothing is set in stone this year,” Riverside coach Harry Armstrong said. “We are going to take the opportunities that we are presented with, considering what we are facing. And our superintendent (Paul Brennan) and the administration have been phenomenal in supporting us and making sure that we have opportunities to compete.
 “When one door closes, another opens to allow us to stay on this path.”
 With Hanover Area picking its schedule back up, that also leaves Lakeland without an opponent for the final week of the regular season. The Chiefs had scheduled Tunkhannock to fill in the void left by Carbondale Area, which has suspended sports this fall. Lakeland has not agreed to an opponent for that week, according to athletic director Brian Wagner. The other LFC Division III teams picked up crossover games against LFC Division I opponents.
 For Riverside, which scrimmages at Tunkhannock on Saturday, it is going to log a lot of miles this season. The Vikings, who are a District 2 Class 2A program, open at Wyoming Area, the defending PIAA Class 3A champion. After a bye week, it travels to Tamaqua, which finished 12-3 last season, won the District 11 Class 3A championship and lost in the state semifinals to Wyoming Area, 21-0.
 “It’s obvious on paper it is a great challenge,” Armstrong said. “We have the state champs and the runner-up in the east. But our main opponent will be ourselves and making sure we are healthy and working hard to get better in practice. That is our No. 1 goal. We are going to have our hands full, no doubt. But it pales in comparison to what we are all battling every day, growing as a team, and maturing as young adults as we navigate through a very tough time for all of us.”
 Riverside starts its LFC schedule Oct. 2 at rival Old Forge, which has won nine of the last 10 games in the series. The Blue Devils are also ranked No. 3 in the state among Class 1A teams, according to Pennlive.com.
 The Vikings then play at North Pocono, a Class 4A opponent, giving it four straight road games.
 Lakeland will be the Vikings’ first home game Oct. 16. Then, the Vikings are back on the road at Mid Valley before finishing at home against Dunmore, which is the third defending district champion on their schedule and is also the state’s No. 3 ranked team in Class 2A.

Following an up-and-down season that saw Leavenworth football start 0-2, quickly regroup to 2-2 then go 1-4 down the back end of the schedule to finish 3-6, the Pioneers showed up to the team's summer workouts in large numbers.
   
 "Summer was great," head coach Sean Sachen said. "We started June 1 and had our best summer attendance since I've been here. We did not use the weight room but got lots of workouts and skills developed outside."
   
 The Pioneers started practice Monday, a week later than many other area schools, and Sachen said the team still has a lot of room for improvement.
   
 "I think for where I see this team being and where we are, we have a long way to go," he said. "But my assistant coaches thought we looked good for day one."
   
 The Pioneers will aim to improve on how they close out games as they fell by eight or fewer points in three contests last season. Sachen said the team needs to capitalize on the momentum that was generated in those close games last season.
   
 "We need to build on what our senior leadership left us with," he said, "which was a very competitive attitude, regardless of the score."
   
 At the quarterback position, the Pioneers will have to replace the dual-threat ability of former starter JoVaughn Darthard and are looking at a trio of underclassmen to step into the role. Sachen said Eddie McLaughlin is the frontrunner at the moment.
   
 "Eddie is a very dynamic runner who can throw as well," he said. "Once he figures out our scheme in a pressure situation, he could be very special."
   
 Leavenworth will have a full house in the wide receiver department but will have experience in its running game with Keenan Brown slated to step into the starting role and three of five starters on the offensive line returning - Luke Wagne, Alijandro Griese and Justin Pettis.
   
 On the defensive side of the ball, Sachen expects free safety Nathan Waugh, inside linebacker Trenton Harper, cornerback Santiago McLaughlin and defensive lineman Devin Bruning to take big steps forward.
   
 Sachen said the Pioneers were quick to implement health standards to prevent the spread of COVID-19 but concerns of the season being postponed still loom.
   
 "The concern is always about keeping kids and their families safe," he said. "But we are also concerned that the season can be taken away from us at any given moment."
   
 The Pioneers are scheduled to open the season Sept. 11 on the road against Basehor-Linwood. Kick off is scheduled for 7 p.m.

Ever since Gov. Tom Wolf declared the COVID-19 public health emergency in March, Republican legislative leaders have complained that he has exceeded his authority under the state’s constitution and laws — even though the state Supreme Court disagreed.
 Now, the governor himself has decided not to extend the emergency order’s ban on evictions and foreclosures through the end of the year, saying that he lacks the legal authority to do so.
 Incredibly, after complaining for months about Wolf’s supposed abuse of power, House Republicans condemned the governor for asking them to extend the eviction and foreclosure moratorium.
 “Gov. Wolf has ignored the law and acted by fiat for the last six months. It is curious now that he is searching for the limits of his authority as an excuse to pass the buck to the General Assembly over the crisis he created for both property owners and renters,” said Jason Gottesman, spokesman for House Republicans.
 Such sophistry would warrant a shrug during normal operations in the state Capitol. Amid a crisis in which an estimated 400,000 Pennsylvanians could face eviction as of Tuesday due to the lapsed moratorium, it is appalling.
 The moratorium’s expiration was not one of the state government’s many secrets. As Senate Democratic Minority Leader Jay Costa noted, the Legislature has wasted the last 26 days in which it could have extended the moratorium.
 An eviction wave isn’t going to help renters or landlords. Wolf called on the Legislature to help both.
 “The General Assembly must act to fix these problems immediately to provide meaningful assistance to this vital sector of the economy and prevent the displacement of Pennsylvanians as we continue to fight the COVID-19 virus,” he said. “The Legislature should raise the $750 a month payment to at least 130% of HUD limits which would actually assist landlords in higher cost areas, lead to greater participation in the program and increase the number of tenants assisted.”
 So, Wolf passed not only the buck but a useful recommendation. Unfortunately, too many lawmakers would prefer that the governor do what they have done for hard-pressed working people during the worst economic crisis of our time — nothing.

Kyoto - Diners can now enjoy eating while talking without fear of potentially spreading the novel coronavirus thanks to a handheld mask developed by the head of Kyoto Saga University of Arts.

Air Works, an independent maintenance, repair, overhaul (MRO) and diversified aviation services provider, has appointed Haseeb A Drabu as Independent Director on the Board of the company.
 Drabu is a noted economist and policy maker. He has been an advisor to several institutions and corporates on issues such as macro and monetary policy, banking and finance operations, fund management, corporate investment, and governance advisory. He has worked as a lawmaker and a policy planner. In his most recent engagement until March 2018, he was Finance Minister of the State of Jammu & Kashmir (now a Union Territory).
 Commenting on his appointment, Drabu said, “I see Air Works, as a model enterprise, not only for the Indian aviation ecosystem of which it is a quintessential part, but also for business in general. The company has had a rich legacy, and a richer brand equity, built on performance and values. As such, notwithstanding the ongoing circumstances, it is uniquely positioned to be the key player in making India an MRO hub. I am keen to engage with other members of the Board and the Air Works’ management to help realise their collective vision and ambition.”
 D Anand Bhaskar, MD & CEO, Air Works, said, “Drabu’s addition to Air Works’ Board is well-timed. His deep understanding and experience in the areas of policy, planning, banking and economics will have an invaluable bearing on Air Works’ overall business strategy and destiny, in light of the unprecedented fluctuation in the economic scenario and the current state of Indian aviation due to Covid-19. Despite having a resilient DNA, we look forward to leverage his rich experience and further strengthen Air Works, embracing both emerging and best practices in corporate governance in order to reinvent our business in sync with the new, emerging normal.”
 Air Works is India’s largest provider of line maintenance services to global airlines and is certified to maintain over 55 types of aircraft, making it also the most diversified MRO in the country with a pan-India network of 27 locations and over 1,300 employees, serving both civil (fixed wing and rotary wing) and military customers including global OEMs, commercial airlines.

 Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain, representing the Centre, said the movie has dented the image of the IAF as it showed that the force is gender biased, which is not correct.

When Kuwait’s then-Finance Minister Anas Al-Saleh warned in 2016 that it was time to cut spending and prepare for life after oil, he was ridiculed by a population raised on a seemingly endless flow of petrodollars. Four years on, one of the world’s richest countries is struggling to make ends meet as a sharp decline in energy prices raises profound questions over how Gulf Arab states are run.
 Al-Saleh’s long gone, shifting to other cabinet positions. A successor, Mariam Al-Aqeel, moved on in January, two weeks after suggesting Kuwait restructure a public-sector wage bill that’s the single biggest drag on state finances. Her replacement, Barak Al-Sheetan, warned last month there was not enough to cash to pay state salaries beyond October.
 Slow to adjust big-spending habits as oil revenues fall, the Gulf states are hurtling towards a moment of economic reckoning, prompting renewed debate over the future of nations that for decades bought popular loyalty with state largesse.
 “We are going to wake up one day and realise we went through all our savings, not because we did not check our bank statement but because we looked at it and said, its probably a bank glitch, and then bought the latest Rolex,” said Fawaz Al-Sirri, who heads Bensirri political and financial communications firm.
 ## Shift to renewable energy
 The OPEC club of oil-exporters has revived crude from its historic drop this year, but $40 is still too low. The coronavirus pandemic and shift towards renewable energy threaten to keep prices depressed.
 Saudi Arabia is curbing benefits and imposing taxes. Bahrain and Oman, where reserves are less plentiful, are borrowing and seeking support from wealthier neighbors. The UAE diversified with the rise of Dubai as a logistics and finance hub.
 In Kuwait, however, a standoff between the elected parliament and a government whose prime minister is appointed by the emir, has led to policy gridlock. Lawmakers have thwarted plans to reallocate state handouts and blocked proposals to issue debt.
 Instead, the government has almost exhausted its liquid assets, leaving it unable to cover a budget deficit expected to reach the equivalent of almost $46 billion this year.
 It has been a gradual decline for Kuwait, which in the 1970s, was among the most dynamic Gulf states, with its outspoken parliament, entrepreneurial heritage and educated people.
 Then the 1982 crash of an informal stock market shook Kuwait’s economy and coincided with instability from the near decade-long Iran-Iraq war. Kuwait embarked on a spending spree to rebuild after Saddam Husseins assault led to the 1991 Gulf War. It took years for oil to flow freely again.
 Kuwait still relies on hydrocarbons for 90 per cent of its income. The state employs 80 per cent of working Kuwaitis, who out-earn private-sector counterparts. Benefits for housing, fuel and food can total $2,000 a month for an average family. Salaries and subsidies soak up three-quarters of spending by the state, which is heading for its seventh consecutive deficit since the 2014 oil slump.

As the upcoming city elections are gaining momentum, and the city candidates state their positions, I would like to comment on the mayor's election contest.
 Although a resident of Clarke County, I have had a number of business properties in the City of Winchester for almost 30 years, during which, over the last 20 years, I have watched David Smith and his partner build up their business in the historic district from scratch, and flourish even in spite of difficult financial times — due to their dedication, hard work, and perseverance.
 David is and has always been a well-mannered and gracious gentleman, who is always prepared to listen. He knows the city well, and his extensive business experience has made him able to deal with the increasing difficulties currently being faced by City Council due to a combination of financial, staffing and pandemic issues, which together would challenge the most experienced of business leaders — all without losing his cool.
 His opponent, Ms. Bostick, a recent arrival in Winchester, in spite of an announced ambitious platform, does not appear to have a career to-date (former clinical mental health counselor, activist and current Latin teacher) adapted to prepare her for the rigors of what all of our public officials are facing today: managing tight budgets, multiple staffing issues, and COVID demands.
 I therefore strongly urge Winchester residents to cast their vote for David. In my personal opinion, he is by far the better choice.

Robin Williams was constantly trying to shake off an "invisible monster" as he struggled with Lewy body dementia, according to the comedy icon's widow.
 Susan Schneider Williams has opened up about the debilitating illness which led the Mrs. Doubtfire star to take his own life in new documentary Robin's Wish, revealing they always knew there was more to his health crisis than the Parkinson's disease he had been diagnosed with just three months before his death in August 2014.
 The actor, who had a history of depression and substance abuse, had experienced the loss of motor and cognitive functions, and was haunted by insomnia, paranoia, and hallucinations, which doctors believed had all been brought on by Parkinson's - but the couple was convinced that wasn't quite right, and the comic even feared he had schizophrenia.
 "Robin and I knew there was so much more going on. Robin was right when he said to me, 'I just want to reboot my brain,'" Susan shared on America's Today show.
 "In that moment I promised him that we would get to the bottom of this and I just didn't know that would be after he passed."
 Robin died at the age of 63, and it was only during the autopsy that coroners discovered the truth of his neurological condition, which had ravaged his brain.
 "I was called in to sit down to go over the coroner's report. They sat me down and said essentially Robin died of diffused Lewy body dementia," she recalled. "They started to talk about the neurodegeneration. He wasn't in his right mind."
 "I was relieved it had a name," she continued. "Robin and I had gone through this experience together, really being chased by an invisible monster. And it was like whack-a-mole with the symptoms. I left there with a name of the disease, the thing that Robin and I had been searching for."
 In the months leading up to Robin's suicide, doctors suggested the couple sleep in separate beds to help the funnyman conquer his sleep troubles - but that only confused the star into thinking he and Susan were splitting up.
 His heartbroken widow remembered, "He said to me, 'Does this mean we're separated?' And that was a really shocking moment."
 Susan wanted to share Robin's story in the new film to honour "the greatest love I've ever known, my best friend, my partner", and raise awareness about Lewy body dementia, as she believes it's what he would have wanted.
 "I asked him, 'When we get to the end of our lives, and we're looking back, what is it we want to have done?' Without missing a beat, he said, 'I want to help people be less afraid.' I thought it was beautiful and I said, 'Honey, you're already doing that, that's what you do.' And that is pretty great," she smiled.
 Robin's Wish, directed by Tylor Norwood, also features interviews with the actor's Night at the Museum director Shawn Levy, and The Crazy Ones creator David E. Kelley, and is out now on video-on-demand.

Israel's Strategic Affairs Minister Orit Farkash-Hacohen spoke with Israeli Tour de France team co-owner Sylvan Adams regarding Israel's public image in light of the cycling event, which began earlier this week, according to a press release from the ministry on Tuesday.
 Adams, a Canadian-Israeli real billionaire originally from the city of Montreal in the province of Quebec, made Aliyah (immigrated to Israel) in 2015 and settled in 2015. A cycling enthusiast, Adams was in part responsible for bringing the 2018 Giro d'Italia to Israel.
 The current Israeli team participating in France, called the Israel Start-Up Nation Team, consists of top international cyclists led by Dan Martin, and the first Israeli cyclist to compete in the tour, Guy Niv.
 During the discussion, Farkash and Adams spoke about the team's progress and the latter's devotion to promoting a positive image of Israel abroad in different forums.
 "Do not stop dreaming," Farksah told Adams.  "Your visions become reality. What you do is a great inspiration and I want to see more of your initiatives," Farkash added.
 In regard to the threats to Israel's image abroad, Farkash requested from Adams' to continue his work of supporting Israeli athletes and sports to combat anti-Israel activities.
 "Slander and boycotts will not stop us", Farkash noted, while also highlighting the team's historic participation in the cycling competetion as a victory over the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement.
 "I know it's not something that will stop you. In a world full of attempts to delegitimize the State of Israel, it is important to have someone like you as an ambassador for Israel," Farkash added.
 Adams also spoke of his intention of bringing more of Israel to the world stage, saying "I want to put Israel on the world stage to show the true face of Israel and our heart. Israel is a modern Western democracy, and home to the people that gave the world the Bible and the values of the Bible."
 "The flag of Israel is proudly emblazoned on the team's uniform and their bikes. People stop us to take pictures. We have more friends than enemies.

Dear Dave,   With COVID-19 and all the resulting economic problems, do you have any advice for what a young person can do to prepare for the future?   Kyle


  Dear Kyle,   Regardless of the coronavirus or any economic situation that might arise, there are always a few smart, simple things people can do to protect themselves financially. The number one thing is to live on a written, monthly budget. When you give every dollar a name, and write it down on paper, you're telling your money what to do, instead of scratching your head and wondering where it went.


  Staying out of debt and saving as much money as possible are two other great ideas. Remember, your income is your biggest wealth-building tool. If you're saddled with a bunch of debt, your money goes to creditors - not into your pocket. Saving prepares you for the future and all the unexpected things, both good and bad, life will throw at you.


  Even though you're young, investing is a key component in creating a stable financial outlook for yourself. In your 20s, just $100 a month invested properly in good growth stock mutual funds can make you a millionaire by the time you're ready to retire.


  Like I said, these are all simple things. But they'll make a huge difference in your financial situation now and in the years to come!   Dave


  Pay that thing off!


    Dear Dave,   My only debt right now is a car payment. I still owe $12,000 on the vehicle, and I currently have $25,000 in savings. I'm in a very stable line of work, but my income can vary somewhat from month to month. Should I hang on to my savings, or pay off the car?   Erik


  Dear Erik,   Debt is a bad thing to have in your life, especially when your income can vary from paycheck to paycheck. You're in good shape, except for the car note, though. It's like a ball and chain around your neck.


  You'd still have $13,000 left if you paid off the car. And with the money you'd free up, you could rebuild your savings in no time. Pay off the car, dude!   Dave

When Kuwait’s then-Finance Minister Anas Al-Saleh warned in 2016 that it was time to cut spending and prepare for life after oil, he was ridiculed by a population raised on a seemingly endless flow of petrodollars. Four years on, one of the world’s richest countries is struggling to make ends meet as a sharp decline in energy prices raises profound questions over how Gulf Arab states are run.
 Al-Saleh’s long gone, shifting to other Cabinet positions. A successor, Mariam Al-Aqeel, moved on in January, two weeks after suggesting Kuwait restructure a public-sector wage bill that’s the single biggest drag on state finances. Her replacement, Barak Al-Sheetan, warned last month there wasn’t enough to cash to pay state salaries beyond October.

Milwaukee learned its B game wasn't enough to beat the Heat on Monday.
 The Bucks hit reset after a Game 1 loss to the Miami Heat and look to even the Eastern Conference semifinals series at 1-1 on Wednesday night.
 "It wasn't a bad game," Bucks guard Kyle Korver said. "It was a B. If you want to win in the playoffs, you've got to get an A."
 The Heat broke away late for a 115-104 victory over the Bucks in Game 1 on Monday night, with Miami star Jimmy Butler vastly outperforming Milwaukee Most Valuable Player candidate Giannis Antetokounmpo.
 Miami opened the postseason last month in a similar manner, dispatching of the higher seed -- No. 4 Indiana -- 113-101 in the best-of-seven opener.
 The Heat took control of the series by duplicating their success in Game 2, winning 109-100 en route to a four-game sweep and is 5-0 in the 2020 playoffs.
 Milwaukee, meanwhile, was stunned 122-110 by eighth-seeded Orlando in their first-round opener two weeks ago.
 The Bucks regrouped to immediately turn the tables on the Magic, romping 111-96 in Game 2 to tip off a sequence of four double-digit wins.
 Goran Dragic had 27 points, Bam Adebayo notched a double-double with 12 points and 17 rebounds, and Andre Iguodala helped spearhead a team defensive effort against Antetokounmpo. It was Butler's postseason career-high 40 points that made the biggest difference in the Heat's opening win over the Bucks.
 Afterward, Antetokounmpo, recently voted the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year, was asked if he had volunteered to guard Butler.
 "No, I didn't. Why would I do that?" he questioned. "I'll do whatever the coach tells me to do."
 Both teams exhausted numerous fouls on the other team's standout. That also worked in Miami's favor.
 While Butler shot 12-for-13 at the free throw line, Antetokounmpo suffered through a 4-for-12 night.
 Miami outscored Milwaukee 25-14 from the line in the 11-point win.
 Butler credited a team effort for the win.
 "It's not about just scoring," he professed. "It's about guarding. It's about making the right play, getting the 50-50 ball. That's all part of winning the game."
 Antetokounmpo also had a poor night at the line in the Game 1 loss to Orlando, going 4-for-9. He rebounded to go 7-for-8 in Game 2 as part of a 28-point, 20-rebound double-double.
 The Heat limited Antetokounmpo to 12 field goal attempts in the series opener. It was his fewest shots since taking 10 in a loss at Boston in Game 5 of their first-round series in 2018.
 Antetokounmpo fired up 23 shots in his next game that time, scoring 31 points in a win.
 Milwaukee went without guard Eric Bledsoe in Game 1 due to a strained hamstring. He is listed as questionable for Game 2.
 The Bucks outshot the Heat overall (49.3 percent to 46.4) and on 3-pointers (45.7 percent to 38.7), but took nine fewer shots than Miami. Nineteen Bucks turnovers and 12 Heat offensive rebounds contributed to that disparity.
 Antetokounmpo was harassed into a game-high six of the turnovers.
 Adebayo, meanwhile, had six of Miami's 12 offensive rebounds, one shy of the Milwaukee team total.
 Khris Middleton with 28 points and Brook Lopez with 24 were the Bucks' top scorers in Game 1.

The suspects in the Eilat gang-rape of a 16-year-old girl are expected to be indicted on Wednesday, some for the act of rape and sexual assault, and others for assisting in a rape and failure to prevent a crime, police told Israeli media throughout Wednesday morning.
 Maya Azrad, the senior youth researcher in the case, told Army Radio on Wednesday that the main suspect "took advantage of her [drunk] condition, offered first aid claiming that he knows how to, and took her to the room. There, he took advantage of her condition to perform numerous acts on her."
 Police revealed the entire story of how the brutal act came about.
 The victim was with her friend at the hotel pool in the Red Sea Hotel. They had been drinking, and she was severely inebriated and feeling unwell. A 27-year-old approached her and attempted to make advancements, but she rejected him offhand, stating that he is too old for her. A few 17-year-olds were in the pool with them, as well, and she knew some of them personally.
 Shortly thereafter, the victim went up to the hotel room of a friend to cool herself down, as she was not staying in the hotel room herself. Upon arriving in the area of the hotel rooms, one of the two 27-year-olds met her there, pretending to be a medical professional, and offered her first aid. He told the victim's friend to go to the nearest store to get her snacks to help her friend, effectively sending her away. That is when he led her into a different hotel room.
 At least 16 men entered the room to rape and sexually assault the victim. Most of them were 17 years old, one was 19, and the two 27-year-olds. Their entering and exiting the hotel room was caught on the security tapes acquired by police from the hotel. Some of the attackers could be seen texting one another and inviting them up.
 The following day, a few of the attackers asked the victim if she wanted to meet with them again. She did not remember being with them the previous night. They attempted to remind her, even telling her that footage exists of the event. That is when the victim understood that she had been raped.
 "There was no way she could give consent," Azrad told Army Radio.
 Four of the suspects are expected to be indicted for rape, while the rest will be indicted for sexual assault, failure to prevent a crime, and some for assisting in a rape.
 All minors, including those suspected of participating in the rape itself, were initially released on house arrest by the court, prompting harsh criticism by the police. One police officer involved in the case said that the court's decision shows that the court "does not understand the gravity of the affair."
 ""They were involved directly in the rape," a police representative said. "Their place is in jail and not at home."
 Four of the minors suspected of being directly involved in the sexual assault of the victim were kept in police custody in the end after the court overturned its initial decision.
 Meanwhile, the victim is in a difficult mental state and is being accompanied by a youth investigator. "She is usually at home because she is embarrassed," Azrad said to Army Radio. "We tried to protect her name, but her name was passed on... She is being addressed personally."

Activists have also voiced concerns that Bisri is on an active seismic fault line.


  Geologist Mohammed Khawlie says the dam won't store the expected amounts of water. “The rocks are very porous, they absorb the water, the land is karstic,” he explains, referring to a terrain that is formed of soluble rocks and limestone.


  “If you want to solve this problem by injecting cement into the dam structure, then you are incurring hundreds of millions of dollars in additional cost.”


  Other recently built dams in Lebanon have failed for similar reasons, Khawlie said.


  Environmental expert Paul Abi Rashed says the project will destroy more than 6 million square meters of green land, among Lebanon’s most scenic and pristine. “We are talking about vast agricultural lands, pine forests, the second largest roosting area for migratory birds in Lebanon,” he adds.

It is with profound sadness that I announce the passing of Murray William Michael Dalgarno. Murray's life started in Kitchener, Ontario on February 10, 1960. He was the loving son of William 'Bill' and Olive Dalgarno. As a young man he was actively involved with his Baptist Church Youth Leaders program, and also with Big Brothers. He graduated from Bluevale Collegiate and Conestoga College. I started tagging along on Murray's journey on May 21, 1990 and as life partners we just celebrated 30 fabulous years together! We celebrated every "monthaversary", this last one over the phone from different hospitals. We loved, travelled, worked, and tried every day to make our world a better place for us and everyone else in it. Murray used broad strokes of colour to brighten our lives!!! Interior design, holiday decorating, and gardening allowed his artistic side to flow. Dance classes, cooking classes, Book Club, BBQ Club, and hosting elaborate dinner parties and themed parties let the fun side shine! No one could ask for a more true, compassionate, giving friend; his generosity had no limits. Murray was larger than life in the best possible way! He will be deeply missed by our many friends, family, and of course his "cousins" all around the world! Remember him especially this first Christmas without Santa's Biggest Elf being here to guide us. Be kind to everyone you meet.....they just might be one of Murray's cousins. Murray's journey ended in Woodstock, Ontario far too early on Saturday, August 22, 2020 with a heart attack brought on by a blood clot caused by the sudden onset of diabetes. Murray is survived by Dwayne Covert, and by his beautiful greyhound Roo. A private Celebration of Life will take place in Murray's garden. Thank you to all of the Staff at Ingersoll and Woodstock Hospitals for caring for him....especially his fabulous nurses in I.C.U. Memorial donations to the Needlenose Greyhound Adoption in Campbellville, Ontario or charity of your choice are appreciated and may be made directly, or by cheque through Wareing Cremation Services, 225 Norwich Ave., Woodstock (519-290-5575) entrusted with arrangements.

The Delhi High Court on Wednesday refused to stay at this stage streaming of Netflix movie ‘Gunjan Saxena - The Kargil Girl’, on the Centre’s plea that it depicts the Indian Air Force (IAF) in bad light.
 Justice Rajiv Shakdher asked the Centre as to why it did not approach the court before release of the movie on Over The Top (OTT) platform, and said an injunction cannot be granted now as the film is already streaming.
 Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain, representing the Centre, said the movie has dented the image of the IAF as it showed that the force is gender biased, which is not correct.
 The high court sought response of Dharma Productions Private Limited, which produced the film, and Netflix on the Centre’s plea to stop streaming of the movie.
 The court said it was of the view that former Flight Lieutenant Gunjan Saxena should also be made a party to the suit and issued notice to her, seeking her response.
 The movie was released on OTT platform on August 12.

Duch was admitted to the Cambodian Soviet Friendship Hospital after developing difficulty breathing Monday at the Kandal provincial prison, said Chat Sineang, chief of the prison to which Duch had been transferred from the tribunal's prison facility in 2013. He added that the body would be examined for cause of death before being handed to his family.
 Duch, whose trial took place in 2009, was the first senior Khmer Rouge figure to face the U.N.-backed tribunal that had been assembled to deliver justice for the regime’s brutal rule in the late 1970s, which is blamed for the deaths of 1.7 million people — a quarter of Cambodia’s population at the time.
 The commander of the top-secret Tuol Sleng prison, code-named S-21, was one of the few ex-Khmer Rouge who acknowledged even partial responsibility for his actions, and his trial included his own graphic testimony of how people were tortured at the prison.
 Men, women and children seen as enemies of the regime or who disobeyed its orders were jailed and tormented there, and only a handful survived.
 "Everyone who was arrested and sent to S-21 was presumed dead already,” he testified in April 2009.
 Torturers under Duch beat and whipped prisoners and shocked them with electrical devices, Duch admitted to the court, but still he denied accounts from survivors and other trial witnesses that he took part in torture and executions himself. The offspring of detainees were killed to ensure the next generation could not take vengeance. Duch called himself "criminally responsible” for babies’ deaths but blamed his subordinates for battering the young bodies against trees.
 He said the prison’s own guards and interrogators were killed for small mistakes and showed rare emotion on the witness stand in June 2009 while speaking of seeing his fellow revolutionaries locked in the cells of his prison. Confessing to betraying his own friends, he said: "That was beyond cowardly.”
 When a guilty verdict was finally delivered against him in July 2010, he was sentenced to 35 years, shortened to just 19 due to time served. The judges said they considered the Cold War context of the atrocities and Duch’s cooperation and expressions of remorse, however limited. But outraged survivors feared he could one day walk free. On appeal, the sentence was lengthened in 2012 to life in prison for his "shocking and heinous” crimes against the Cambodian people.
 Like many key members of the Khmer Rouge, Duch was an academic before he became a revolutionary. The former math teacher joined Pol Pot’s movement in 1967, three years before the U.S. started carpet-bombing Cambodia to try to wipe out Northern Vietnamese troops and Viet Cong across the border.
 The Khmer Rouge seized power in 1975 and immediately attempted a radical transformation of Cambodia into a peasant society, emptying cities and forcing the population to work on the land. They backed up their rule with ruthless elimination of perceived enemies and, by 1976, Duch was the trusted head of the regime's ultimate killing machine, S-21.
 Tribunal judges said he signed off on all executions there and was often present when interrogators used torture to extract confessions, including pulling out prisoners’ toenails, administering electric shocks and waterboarding. Despite his denials, the judges said he had at times taken part in the torture and executions himself.
 The torture and executions that took place at Tuol Sleng were routinely recorded and photographed, and when the Khmer Rouge was forced from power in 1979, the thousands of documents and film negatives left at the prison became proof of the regime’s atrocities.
 Duch fled, disappearing for almost two decades in northwestern Cambodia and converting to Christianity until a chance discovery by a British journalist in 1999 led to his arrest.
 Duch has several times asked for forgiveness, even offering at one point to face a public stoning. But his surprise request on the final day of the trial to be acquitted and freed left many wondering if his contrition was sincere.

Why is it, though, that only when angered do we feel the need to be vocal? Oftentimes the voices screaming the loudest are those with something negative to say, while those offering praise do so softly and behind closed doors.

Clarence Chesterfield "Buck" Gay Jr died on August 20, 2020 in Houston Texas. Buck was born in Fort Worth, Texas on December 20, 1933 to Clarence Chesterfield ("Deacon") Gay and Nina Almedia Neely and grew up in Fort Worth along with his sister Carol and brother David, attending Carter Riverside High School. He was the first in his family to attend college, earning a BS in Aeronautical Engineering from Texas A&M College in 1955, where he was a proud member of the Corp of Cadets. While attending A&M he met Flo Ann Noack on a blind date at an Aggie football game and the two married on August 14, 1954.      After a brief stint with Lockheed in Los Angeles, California, in May 1956 he went into the US Air Force as a 2nd Lieutenant to fulfill his service commitment and began training as a pilot (his dream job) at bases in San Antonio, Texas and Kinston, NC. He was enamored with airplanes all his life and when his dream of flying jets was lost due to a reaction to a flu shot, he focused on designing aircraft and landed in Research & Development at Wright- Patterson AFB in Dayton Ohio where he was a Project Engineer in the Analysis and Design Branch of the Dynasoar System Engineering Office. In 1962 he was hired by NASA and joined the fledgling effort to put men on the moon by the end of the decade. In 1963, Buck moved Ann and his family to Virginia and began work on the Gemini program at NASA Headquarters in Washington D.C. He continued working there until 1971, receiving the NASA Exceptional Service Award in 1969 for his contributions to the Apollo 11 moon landing. His final years in D.C. were as Director of Space Shuttle Operations, overseeing the development of flight programs, operational requirements, and preflight testing. In 1971, he transferred to the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas where he was responsible for the JSC Shuttle Operations Budget and planning and preparation of space shuttle landing sites in the US and emergency sites in Dakar, Senegal, Spain and Okinawa. A personal thrill was heading a spectacular landing of STS-3 at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. In 1984, he retired from NASA and worked until 1991 for Eagle Engineering, Grumman, and Muniz Engineering, participating in the joint US and Russia spaceflight program and development of the manned space station.      In addition to his fascinating career he led a rich, full life. He was the proud patriarch of a family that included 6 children, 15 grandchildren and 9 great grand kids. To all he was known as Papaw, and he delighted in the large family gatherings on holidays, major achievements, and reunions each year at Surfside Beach.      He traveled extensively, making it to the Pyramids in Egypt, the heart of the Amazon, the Great Wall of China, around the horn in South America, and saw the Serengeti in Africa from a hot air balloon.      He loved hunting and fishing and passed his passion for fly fishing to his children and grandchildren. He taught all his sons and grandsons about sporting guns and introduced them to duck, geese and dove hunting. A highlight of each year for him was an annual fly-fishing trip to some of the top US destinations in Montana, Idaho, Alaska, and Wyoming. While raising his children he served as a scoutmaster, little league coach and umpire, and Pony Colt League President.      He loved adventure and pursued challenging hobbies including flying single engine airplanes and gliders, racing sailboats, and scuba diving. In celebration of his 75th birthday he went skydiving. Not content to merely enjoy these activities, he excelled, learning to fly acrobatics, becoming a gliding instructor, and served as Commodore of the Galveston Bay Cruising Association (GBCA) and was a frequent race champion - thanks to a dedicated crew of close friends.      As his working career wound down, he filled his time by volunteering in the community, serving on the Nassau Bay Parks Committee, and co-chaired the restoration of the Nassau Bay Peninsula and its' establishment as a wildlife preserve. He also served on the CCISD Education Committee and was the photographer for Nassau Bay City Council meetings.      He was extremely proud to have worked with the Bay Area Habitat for Humanity for nearly 25 years, helping build over 100 houses for needy families before finally hanging up his tool belt at the age of 84. He greatly valued the many close friendships he developed during his tenure.      He was a member of St Paul's Catholic Church in Nassau Bay since 1971 and was a Eucharistic Minister for 30 years. He was also active in the Knights of Columbus where he served as Grand Knight for 2 years. Each 4th of July he stayed up nearly all night helping to prepare barbeque for their primary fund raiser.      He was preceded in death by his parents Nina and Deacon, and his sister Carol Lynn Lawson and is survived by his beloved wife of 66 years Ann, brother David Conrad Gay, sons Richard Lee Gay, Ronald Lynn Gay, Robert Glen Gay, and Randall Lawson Gay and daughters Linda Gay Dunk and Laurie Gay Vaughn.      Please contact the family at buckfuneral@sbcglobal.net for funeral details. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that you consider a donation to the Bay Area Habitat for Humanity or the Alzheimer's Association Houston and Southeast Texas Chapter.

Sonically, _Suburbia_ hypnotises you from start to finish. From the neo-soul textures of _Russian Girls_ to the sparkling acoustic tides of _Weed And Conversation,_ the artist melts her diverse sonic reach into crystal clear pools of reflection, singing her memories as though they were physical images. darby has an incredible talent for storytelling. With just her lush vocals and buttery guitar melodies, she could easily sing a cinematic universe into the bars of a chorus. _Suburbia_ is much more than that though.
