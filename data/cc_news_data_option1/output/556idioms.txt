Xu placed first in his event at 57.99 seconds, and in the span of just minutes, Wayland had accumulated 37 team points, and leapfrogged St. John’s Prep in the blink of an eye, with one event remaining.

The 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team’s victory over the favored team from the Soviet Union in the “Miracle on Ice” game may be the best remembered sporting event in U.S. history.
