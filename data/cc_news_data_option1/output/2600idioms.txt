_3 July 2020_
 _Dear Parents and Caregivers,_
 _As you know I have been on personal leave for much of this year. It has been a period of reflection, introspection and prayer. It has afforded me the time to reflect on my time as a school leader and importantly the reasons why I choose to be a leader. After 22 years as a school administrator, my wife Angeline, our boys and I have decided to move on, into the next phase of our lives. As a result, I have tendered my resignation to the Board of Governors as the Executive Principal of both Moreton Bay College and Moreton Bay Boys' College._
 _I would take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the Board generally, and the then Board Chair Mr Graham Dredge in particular. They saw in me a leader who could drive a whole school improvement agenda and bring the two colleges together as one community. Together, the Board and the school executive have much to be proud of from the last six years. The collaboration has produced a new Strategic Plan which maps out an exciting_
 _and compelling future for the Colleges as well as a new Master Plan for the continued infrastructure development and built environment. In my time with the Board there have been numerous governance practices put in place that should give the school community confidence that the colleges are in good hands. The determined work of the then Chief Financial Officer, Mrs Nicole Hawkins along with the Finance Committee of the Board has resulted in the Colleges enjoying a strong financial position with a very secure future._
 _There are many developments and initiatives put in place over the years. Perhaps too many to list however, the focus on our girls and our boys has been at the forefront of our work together. Their academic progress and well-being have provided a broad framework that has seen data-analytics programs to focus curriculum and instructional practices, deprivatised pedagogical practices as well as the launch of an evidence-based wellbeing framework. The co-curricular programs have been a way to bring our boys and girls together to learn with,_ _alongside and from each other. Our combined music program is the envy of other schools and sport continues to go from strength to strength. There is certainly much to be proud of._
 _Our relationship with the Uniting Church is a critical one and our entire community should cherish this. Their oversight of our Colleges, spiritual leadership and pastoral care for us all as a community is a true blessing. I am most appreciative of the spiritual guidance of the Rev. Peter Lockhart in particular Personally, I am most proud of the work we have put in to growing people. Our staff continually make a difference every day with their work ethic, creativity, and student-centred engagement. As a Principal, I gain great joy and job satisfaction in working with leaders and supporting them in their growth, both as leaders and as people. This is an area where I see myself working into the future. I have been fortunate to be accepted to work with an international consultancy collective where I can work with aspiring and existing leaders across both education and corporate sectors._
 _There are so many people to thank however please allow me the indulgence of commending to you the two Heads of College, Mrs Janet Stewart and Mr Andrew Holmes. They are both outstanding school leaders who have proven themselves as more than capable of leading their respective Colleges well into the future. They, along with their leadership teams, should inspire great confidence in our staff, our parents and our students._
 _As my time at the Moreton Bay Colleges comes to an end I have been blessed to be here, grateful to the Board for their belief and support and touched by the many, many private messages of support in recent months._
 _Courage and hope_
 _James Sloman_

NEWTON--Thelma Adams is unsure if an upcoming executive order by Gov. Laura Kelly requiring mask use will help her business or not -- but it surely can't hurt.
   
 The sign in front of her business proclaiming "Face Masks Sold Here" went up several weeks ago, when Alterations by Thelma and Tuxedo Rentals in the 400 block of E. Broadway in Newton needed a way to reopen and recover from losing the biggest days of the year.
   
 "When we shut down, it was prom time," Adams said. "That is my biggest time of the year. That hurt pretty bad."
   
 Prom, traditionally in spring, is when her shop does the most business in tuxedo rentals and dress alterations are in demand. For the 12 years she has been open, it has always been the busiest time.
   
 The executive order, set to be go into effect July 3, will require most Kansans to wear masks in stores and shops, restaurants, and in any situation in which social distancing of 6 feet cannot be maintained, including outside.
   
 According to Kelly's office, the Kansas Attorney General's Office will work closely with officials in Kelly's administration to ensure the order complies with Kansas law.
   
 Making masks was what allowed Adams' business to reopen during shutdown orders at the state and local level. Adams, along with her sister and daughter, started making cloth masks to sell.
   
 Business has been steady, though Adams said there is usually not more than one or two customers in her small shop at one time. Up to now, she has not regularly worn a mask in her shop but has worn one while out shopping.
   
 Now, she said, she will be wearing one in her shop regularly.
   
 There is a counter filled with masks of all different colors and designs, and that is what has pulled people back into her business.
   
 "I go a little crazy at the fabric store," Adams said. "So I have a lot of different masks. ... Fabric, some of it is real hard to find. I have to order sports fabrics, and even there, it takes a long time to get it if you do order it. Chiefs fabric is impossible to get right now. ... Everyone wants it."
   
 She said she knows others are making masks, including a network of volunteers that have been hard at work for months, well before there was an executive order looming to require mask usage.
   
 But she said she enjoys making masks.
   
 "It was a way to stay in business," Adams said. "... It will help out my business, even though I don't like the virus. I mean, even with the circumstances behind it, it has helped me."

The 2020 Independence Day holiday is sure to be a flag waving good time throughout the tri-lakes region of Stockton, Pomme de Terre and Truman, with most communities having some type of celebration.
 Summer is here and all of the recreational facilities are within reach of virtually everyone with easy access to water on the three lakes. Thousands of people prove this each year as they make water sports the area’s most popular outdoor pastime.
 Jack Walker, Sedalia, was visiting friends in Nevada when they all decided to go fishing at Stockton Lake.
 "I never expected to see so many campers and boaters as we saw last weekend,” Walker said. “I guess they had been staying at home because of the virus and were more than ready to hit the water."
 Jim McGuire, at Crabtree Cove Campground, agreed, saying, “Our campgrounds have been busier this year than in any of the past four years. We are booked up for the next month, it’s unreal how busy we are. The boat ramp has had a steady line of boaters and anglers waiting to launch their boats. Even during the weekdays, we have been booked solid. We are usually filled up on weekends with openings during the week, but not so much this year.”
 Camping — either you love it or hate it, depending on when, where and how. The “when” is still about the same for most campers, but the “where” and “how” has changed a lot over the years. In Missouri, the camping experience can mean many different things. You can go canoe camping, hiking, backpacking, boating, bird watching or a variety of other things to do while camping. Anywhere you want to travel in the state, there is a campground ready to accommodate your needs.
 It was not too long ago all the sports and activities associated with water were limited for those who did not live on the coasts. Many inland adults can remember an annual family trip to the beach. It was a major undertaking. Back then, there were undependable cars and undeveloped beaches to contend with making "relaxing" the thing you did once you got back home.
 But the times are changing fast, and here in the Ozarks region of Missouri, recreational opportunities have changed with them: better highways, crisscrossing the area carrying campers, cartop boats and trailered boats. Marinas and modern campgrounds near a lake have more people to enjoy them.
 You will see every kind of boat from a canoe or kayak to a sailboat to a bass boat. For people who crave extra excitement, there are floating rivers in the area, water skiing, scuba diving and even underwater photography.
 The three dams hold back water and make for miles of recreation from fishing to skiing. There is water everywhere for family fun, and July is the perfect month to make a splash. Water is one common denominator for many activities; cruising, camping, fishing, skiing, boating, photography or just watching — water sports can be enjoyed by all, and preferably together.
 Happy camping.

As the corona virus pandemic, social distancing recommendations and different temporary operational measures in most every sense imaginable still are affecting the region’s daily routines, the giving spirit and neighborly comradery in Cedar County has not been stifled.
 Throughout the month of June, every Friday morning will see volunteers come together passing out fresh produce supplied by the United States Department of Agriculture to members of the Stockton community.
 Speaking directly to how Stockton was selected to participate in the program, school administration jovially referred to the opportunity as “almost a happy accident.”
 “When I saw this [food program was available], I applied on behalf of the district sort of on a whim,” retiring Stockton R-I School District superintendent Dr. Shannon Snow said. “Honestly, I thought it was a longshot, you know? I really didn’t expect a response and just figured applying for this [program] couldn’t hurt.”
 Snow said her skepticism went from almost-certain to nonexistent in less than half an hour after she completed the program’s application.
 “About twenty minutes after submitting the application, a representative from the USDA called to ask if we could take an entire semi-truck full of pallets.”
 Snow said she accepted and immediately began notifying school faculty, staff and community volunteers to help coordinate the receipt, unloading and distribution of more than 800 boxes of fresh, domestically-grown produce to anyone and everyone in the greater Stockton area.
 “It’s every Friday in the month of June,” Snow said. “We’ll be here at the school passing this out rain or shine. There are no strings attached, no income requirements, it’s available to anyone who can use it.”
 In furthering the sense of community, a small portion of last week’s haul was sent to Fair Play for local distribution, and more than 1,600 boxes of healthy, American-grown produce already has been provided to Stockton residents, with just as much to come in the weeks ahead.
 “It’s a great thing for the community and a neat thing to be a part of,” Snow said. “Things like this go a long way and all levels of the school and the community have been overwhelmingly willing to help get this food to where it’s needed.”
 In the weeks ahead, beginning at 9 a.m. on Fridays through the month of July, anyone in the community looking to pick up a box of fresh fruit, greens and vegetables is encouraged to come through the Stockton R-I town campus circle drive on South Street and claim a box.
 Volunteers for the food distribution are encouraged and food items are available on a first come, first served basis while supplies last.
 Additional information regarding volunteering and food pickup details can be obtained by visiting the Stockton R-I School District Facebook page.
