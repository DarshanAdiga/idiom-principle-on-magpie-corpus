"His mobility is unique. His arm strength is ridiculous. He's very, very accurate," defensive coordinator Robert Saleh said. "But what I don't think people give him enough credit for is that he actually plays quarterback. There's a lot of people, there's a lot of quarterbacks in this league that will say no to number one and then it just becomes street ball. He gets rid of the ball on time. He puts it where it needs to be. He hits a lot of throws in rhythm. And when he needs to take his shot, he knows how to buy time in the pocket and do it. So he's a superstar in every way you can possibly imagine and he's going to be tough to deal with."

A reporter for National Public Radio alleged Friday that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo screamed obscenities and demanded she prove she could find Ukraine on an unmarked map after she asked -- and Pompeo refused to answer -- whether he owed former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch an apology.
 In an interview aired on NPR's "All Things Considered" on Friday, Pompeo instead replied to NPR's Mary Louise Kelly question by saying, "You know, I agreed to come on your show today to talk about Iran. That's what I intend to do. I know what our Ukraine policy has been now for the three years of this administration."
 He then repeatedly tried to end the interview as Kelly continued to press him on the matter. To her last question on whether Ukraine policy had been hijacked, Pompeo replied, "I've been clear about that. I know exactly what we were doing. I know precisely what the direction the State Department gave to our officials around the world about how to manage our Ukraine policy."
 Speaking after the interview aired, Kelly described how she was called back into Pompeo's living room at the State Department after the interview, where the outburst then unfolded.
 "What is happening (at the end) there is an aide has stopped the interview, said, 'We're done, thank you,' and you heard me thank the secretary," Kelly said on air after the fact. "He did not reply -- he leaned in, glared at me, and then turned and with his aides left the room."
 Kelly said that moments later, "That same staffer who stopped the interview reappeared, asked me to come with her -- just me, no recorder -- though she did not say we were off the record, nor would I have agreed."
 Kelly was brought to Pompeo's private living room, she continued, "where he was waiting and where he shouted at me for about (the) same amount of time as the interview itself had lasted."
 Pompeo was displeased about the Ukraine questioning, and asked her, "Do you think Americans care about Ukraine?" Kelly said, adding that "he used the F-word in that sentence and many others."
 Pompeo then asked Kelly if she could find Ukraine on a map, she recounted, and when she said that she could, "He called out for aides to bring us a map of the world with no writing."
 "I pointed to Ukraine. He put the map away. He said, 'People will hear about this,'" Kelly said. "And then he turned, said he had things to do and I thanked him again for his time and left."
 CNN has reached out to the State Department for comment on the exchange.
 Kelly said that NPR had reached out to the State Department to inform them that the outlet would be reporting on the interview's aftermath, but had not heard back. The news comes in light of Pompeo's impending trip to Ukraine next week -- the country at the heart of the currently ongoing impeachment trial.
 CNN's Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report.

BATON ROUGE – Ed Orgeron, who guided LSU to the 2019 National Championship with a perfect 15-0 record, has agreed to a new contract extension valued at more than $7 million per year that will keep him in Baton Rouge until at least 2026.
 The new six-year agreement includes a base annual salary of $6 million. In addition, Coach O will receive a $5 million split-dollar life insurance policy payable over the first two years of the agreement. In total, the agreement is worth more than $42 million, before bonuses.
 The agreement is pending approval of the LSU Board of Supervisors.
 "Coach O has set a new standard at LSU," said LSU Athletic Director Scott Woodward. "He has proven that he is not only a championship coach, but also a leader of a program committed to doing things the right way. He has represented our institution and our state with great pride, on and off the field of play. He is well-deserving of this new contract, which should make clear our commitment to Coach O and the direction of our football program."
 Orgeron, the consensus 2019 National Coach of the Year, has led LSU to a 40-9 mark as coach of the Tigers. Of his 40 wins at LSU, 12 have come against teams ranked in the Top 10, including seven in 2019, which stands at the most in college football history for a single season. His 40 wins through the first 49 games of his career ties for the most by any coach in LSU history.
 "I'm very appreciative of Scott Woodward, the LSU Board of Supervisors and the state of Louisiana," Orgeron said. "I'm happy to represent LSU and this great state. My family and I are very grateful, and I look forward to working as hard as possible to continue to win championships at LSU."
 In 2019, Orgeron directed LSU to the most dominant season in college football history as the Tigers won 12 of their 15 games by double-figures. LSU outscored its three postseason opponents – Georgia, Oklahoma, and Clemson – by a combined 142-63 on its way to claiming the school's fourth football national title.
 Since taking over the Tigers four games into the 2016 season, 61 one of Orgeron's players have earned their college degrees with another 46 being named to the SEC Academic Honor Roll. In addition to its 40 wins, LSU has produced 12 first-team All-Americans and had players win eight national awards, including 2019 Heisman Trophy Winner Joe Burrow.

"articleBody" : "
 On 13th March 2017, Manohar Parrikar stepped down as the Defence Minister of India and took oath as the Chief Minister of Goa the next day. The Defence ministry was passed on to Shri Arun Jaitley, who was already heading the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Corporate Affairs at that time. Back in Goa, the potential allies insisted that they would extend support to the BJP, only if Parrikar was brought back from Delhi.
 A well-performing Defence Minister had to resign since the State needed a deserving Chief Minister. Both Shri Parrikar and Shri Jaitley are no more with us today and have left a void which is hard to fill.
 In a country of 1.3 billion people, it is hard to find leaders of immaculate character and caliber who can hold public positions of responsibility. Not just at the top, but at all levels - from panchayat to parliament, from villages to cabinet secretariat, from primary schools to universities. This vacuum has held our country back when it is time to grow by leaps and bounds.
 It is time to fill the public leadership vacuum in India in primarily three domains of public life. We need thought leaders to infuse fresh ideas that work in the Indian context. We need social leaders who are rooted in the soil and animated by the thought leaders. And, we need political leaders who represent the will of the people and put the nation above self. There is a dearth of all three types of leaders today.
 For far too long, we have left the destiny of our nation to chance. We hope that an inspired leader will emerge from somewhere and show us a way out. With the emerging crises caused due to climate change, economic and military wars, and technological disruptions, there is an urgent need for systematic creation of public leadership which will guide India to its future.
 India is the only living civilisation on this planet which has retained its character. It has seen its share of ups and downs for several millennia. It has not just survived but thrived. As recent as 250 years ago, the entire world was searching for this prospering land.
 This was possible only because this land has consistently produced great thought leaders, reformist social leaders, and dedicated political leaders. Their names are alive in public memory. But today when we look around, we do not find such leaders in abundance. Post-independence, we have barely produced a few, and they have arisen out of adversity. We need institutions that systematically create public leaders for India. We need these institutions to be rooted in the Indian ethos and produce leaders who take India back to the global stage.
 Throughout history, various countries have created institutions to nurture public leaders whenever they faced a crisis of existence. In the 1870 Franco- Prussian war, the French army was decisively defeated. The quick defeat of the French was attributed to their outdated military education. It broke the morale of the French people. Émile Boutmy, a French political scientist and sociologist analysed this defeat and created École Libre des Sciences Politiques (Sciences Po) as a response.
 The intention was to create an institution that will help France come out of its moral and political crisis. This would be done by training the ruling classes of France to lead France in the right way. Today Sciences Po has produced several French presidents, heads of government and international organisations and much more. It has played a key role in pulling France out of the abyss and making it a superpower.
 The Matsushita Institute of Government and Management is a similar effort in Japan. It was established in 1979 by Konosuke Matsushita, the founder of Panasonic Corporation. The vision was to create leaders who can envision an ideal Japanese society and work to make that dream into a reality. Graduates of the school have become leaders in various walks of life including the Prime Minister of Japan, members of the Japanese Parliament, mayors, academicians, and CEOs. These are some examples to showcase how institutions that create public leaders can change the course of a Nation's future.
 There is an urgent need for such an institution in India. The above institutions were built for a specific country in a specific context. They have produced extraordinary results. We need the same yet different - a world- class Indian institution for public leadership, built for the Indian needs, rooted in the Indian ethos. Institution building for nation building, not just for securing careers of the graduates - this thought has not yet sufficiently entered the minds of the institution builders and philanthropists in India. We need to gather the best of thinkers, policymakers, social workers and the funders to envision such an institution that would not just secure India's future but catapult it back to its worthy place at the global stage.

Government travels by our elected officials are necessary to "bring home the bacon" or, as Commissioner Boice stated, "Fight for our piece of the pie."
 Commissioner Boice also that "recent criticism of county commissioners travel expenses actually shows how prudent they have been in spending education travel funds." What? How can it be deemed prudent when one or more commissioners failed to itemize receipts for their travels, i.e. $1,500 for 38 meals, averaging $39.47 per meal.
 Is not itemizing expenses by county commissioners what Commissioner Boice calls prudent? I admit I have not seen the expense reports in question, but I have to ask — Was that expense for the commissioner in question alone, or did it include other commissioners, persons or pets eating, too? More detailed reporting by The News-Review would have been helpful and clarifying.

A Columbia church donated a staggering $65,500 to the Crossroads to Home Cafe last week after asking its congregation for year-end donations in December.
   
 Maury Hills Church handed Crossroads Cafe founder Con Vrailas a check during a presentation at the 800-member house of worship off Pulaski Highway on Jan. 19. The emergency transitional shelter was established to assist the homeless in Maury County.
   
 As lead pastor Russ Adcox preached to the congregation about the importance of giving to the poor and vulnerable, he invited Vrailas and Crossroads Cafe board members Mark Kirschbaum, Lori Bergland and Ty Cobb on stage during his sermon Jan. 19.
   
 "Community is important," Adcox said in his sermon. "However, participating in community isn't just saying , 'I love you' or 'God bless you.' With community comes responsibility, especially for those of us with more affluence.
   
 "What is our responsibility? It's not a burden. Jesus said, 'It is more blessed to give than receive.' We have to practice that," Adcox added before handing the microphone over to Vrailas, the former owner of Burger King franchises in Columbia.
   
 Vrailas, unaware of what was to come, thanked the church for an earlier donation of 500 blankets. He asked for volunteers at the Crossroads Cafe, which opened in December, offering a place for homeless to learn job skills, to shower, to find clothes and to receive mail. It is located at 419 W. 9th St. in Columbia.
   
 "We will be outside after the service to answer questions," Vrailas said. "Thank for listening to us."
   
 As the group walked away, Adcox asked them to hold on for just a moment.
   
 "We asked you here for two reasons," Adcox said. "One, you knew about is what you just did. I wanted you to tell us about what you do. The second reason, you did not know about. I wanted to give you something."
   
 Vrailas actually attended a Maury Hills service the previous week, Jan. 12, to get a feel for what it was like. He told Adcox he did not like surprises.
   
 He loved this one.
   
 "We took up a collection because we're inspired by what you're doing and believe it is a great work in this community," Adcox said. "I know when you start a non-profit, it is hard to raise money.
   
 "We wanted to give you a gift that changes the future for Crossroads to Home. We asked the congregation for donations on Dec. 15, and I did not know how much to expect. This church far exceeded my expectations."
   
 It was the largest amount the church ever had raised or donated.
   
 "We are giving it to you to get this ministry off the ground," Adcox added.
   
 Vrailas touched his head in disbelief, or perhaps he was light headed temporarily. The congregation applauded as it put its words into action.
   
 "We are going to use that money immediately for temporary shelter with a local hotel, where we can satisfy the need for housing [in the cold weather]," Vrailas said.
   
 The retired businessman and Maury Regional Medical Center volunteer also said the non-profit would buy gas cards for the homeless who live in their cars.
   
 "They need their engines running to keep warm," he added.
   
 Looking back on experience at Maury Hills Church, Vrailas said Sunday he was still in shock.
   
 "It was very generous, and quite unexpected," he said. "We have a number of success stories. We are starting to get a lot of volunteers. We just have to take a day at a time, but shelter is the biggest issue we have."
   
 A couple with nine children came to the Crossroad Cafe last week, Vrailas said.
   
 "We hope to help more people in the long term. It has to be a community effort or it's not going to work," Vrailas added.
   
 Adcox said the church actually raised $130,000. Half went to Crossroads to Home, and the other half will go to an Arkansas church for mission work in Belize.
   
 "I am impressed by the leaders in our church," Adcox said. "I approached our elders last year about giving away part of our year-end contribution. Usually, we use that money to fund the ministry and pay down debt. They surprised me by saying, 'Let's give away all of it.' I was not expecting a contribution of that size at all. It blew me away. I have to thank all of our members and elders for excelling in the grace of giving.
   
 "I really hope our contribution to the Crossroads to Cafe will inspire others to take a look at its mission. I hope the money provides a sound foundation for everything it wants to do in the future," he continued.
   
 Cobb, a former state representative, said government is not the key to getting people back on their feet. He told the congregation that the homeless -- and others in need -- would benefit from having successful people around them.
   
 "The homeless issue in Columbia is motivating people to act," said Cobb, a member of the city's Homeless Coalition. "I think it's one issue that touches nearly everyone's heart."
   
 An effort by Westminster Presbyterian Church and pastor Jeff Kane to assist homeless single mothers in 2019 helped galvanize the community, the Columbia fire chief told The Daily Herald. A temporary shelter at the church was closed for fire code violations. It forced the church and homeless advocates to look for alternatives.
   
 "The kindness by Maury Hills Church is an example of how Columbia cares for and loves everyone who lives here," Cobb said. "Their actions and love for others should inspire all of us to do more."

A reporter for National Public Radio said Friday that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo screamed obscenities and demanded she prove she could find Ukraine on an unmarked map after she asked -- and Pompeo refused to answer -- whether he owed former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch an apology.
 The alleged incident took place after the taping of an interview that aired on NPR's "All Things Considered" Friday. Pompeo instead replied to NPR's Mary Louise Kelly question by saying, "You know, I agreed to come on your show today to talk about Iran. That's what I intend to do. I know what our Ukraine policy has been now for the three years of this administration."
 He then repeatedly tried to end the interview as Kelly continued to press him on the matter. To her last question on whether Ukraine policy had been hijacked, Pompeo replied, "I've been clear about that. I know exactly what we were doing. I know precisely what the direction the State Department gave to our officials around the world about how to manage our Ukraine policy."
 Kelly told listeners in a broadcast later on NPR that after the interview she was called back into Pompeo's living room at the State Department, where the outburst then unfolded.
 "What is happening (at the end) there is an aide has stopped the interview, said, 'We're done, thank you,' and you heard me thank the secretary," Kelly said on air after the fact. "He did not reply -- he leaned in, glared at me, and then turned and with his aides left the room."
 Kelly said that moments later, "That same staffer who stopped the interview reappeared, asked me to come with her -- just me, no recorder -- though she did not say we were off the record, nor would I have agreed."
 Kelly was brought to Pompeo's private living room, she continued, "where he was waiting and where he shouted at me for about (the) same amount of time as the interview itself had lasted."
 Pompeo was displeased about the Ukraine questioning, and asked her, "Do you think Americans care about Ukraine?" Kelly said, adding that "he used the F-word in that sentence and many others."
 Pompeo then asked Kelly if she could find Ukraine on a map, she recounted, and when she said that she could, "He called out for aides to bring us a map of the world with no writing."
 "I pointed to Ukraine. He put the map away. He said, 'People will hear about this,'" Kelly said. "And then he turned, said he had things to do and I thanked him again for his time and left."
 In a statement Saturday, Pompeo claimed that Kelly "lied to me, twice," without specifying exactly what was said.
 "NPR reporter Mary Louise Kelly lied to me, twice. First, last month, in setting up our interview and, then again yesterday, in agreeing to have our post-interview conversation off the record," he said.
 Pompeo in his statement, though, did not dispute Kelly's overall characterization of their exchange and seemed to corroborate Kelly's account that he challenged her with an unmarked map.
 In response, NPR stood by its reporting.
 "Mary Louise Kelly has always conducted herself with the utmost integrity, and we stand behind this report," Nancy Barnes, NPR's senior vice president of news, said in a statement.
 Kelly had said the aide who ushered her over to meet with Pompeo after the interview asked her to come without a recorder, but did not say the exchange would be off the record.
 Kelly also said that NPR had reached out to the State Department to inform them that the outlet would be reporting on the interview's aftermath, but had not heard back. The news comes in light of Pompeo's impending trip to Ukraine next week -- the country at the heart of the currently ongoing impeachment trial.
 CNN's Jennifer Hansler, Veronica Stracqualursi andJeremy Diamond contributed to this report.

ST. ALBANS — Franklin County Home Health Agency is proud to announce that Kelsey Gagne has passed the required certification to become a Certified Hospice & Palliative Care Nursing Assistant (CHPNA).


  For the CHPNA exam, applicants must have hospice and palliative nursing assistant practice of 500 hours in the most recent 12 months or 1,000 hours in the most recent 24 months under the supervision of a registered nurse in the United States prior to applying for the exam. Kelsey chose to pursue this certification independently, studying on her own personal time as well as meeting with the Hospice manager several times over two months to prepare for this exam.


  With her certification, Kelsey will have a higher level of understanding and compassion when caring for Hospice patients and their families and will allow her to provide care to more Hospice clients professionally. Kelsey will be able to provide more support and understanding to clients and their family members.


  “I was ready to take another step in my career and gain more knowledge. Being with someone during their last months is so humbling. I enjoy giving quality care to everyone but those at the end of their life need extra support and I want to be that caring and compassionate person for them”, Kelsey said.


  Emma Cushing, Long-Term Care Coordinator and LNA Supervisor said, “Kelsey is a very confident, gentle and caring LNA and now with the completion of this certification, will be able to provide above par professional care to families during their time of need. Kelsey is a great addition to our FCHHA team”. Hospice Nurse Manager, Jeanne Dube, added, “Certification is being a part of a body of knowledge. Certification brings expertise and broader knowledge to the Hospice, her peers, and more importantly to our clients and families we serve in Franklin County”.


  Congratulations to Kelsey for her hard work and dedication to providing exceptional care to our patients.

  “That raises your labor expenses quite a bit,” Fouts said, and he’s not sure if he’d expand in response.


  For conditions to improve, Fouts said, farmers would need greater influence in how prices are set.


  The USDA sets prices after farmers have delivered their milk.

(Bori also has much to say about what he tastes, a potentially trying characteristic in a narrator given to odes about the deliciousness of human feces.) Whether or not Kim considered writing in the voice of a dog a challenge comparable to writing in the voice of a woman, he does frame it as a kind of moral mission. In the book's foreword he writes of riding his bicycle through the kind of empty villages "people couldn't live in and left," where he once found himself approached by one of the friendlier of the many abandoned dogs wandering the streets.

The Dow and the broader stock market ended deep in the red on Friday as fears over the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus tainted investor sentiment.
 Stocks started the day higher as it appeared markets were shrugging off the coronavirus news, but took a turn for the worse after a second case was confirmed on US soil in Illinois. The first case was confirmed on Tuesday in Washington state. Both patients had traveled to the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus outbreak originated.
 Multiple cities in Wuhan's Hubei province are facing travel restrictions ahead of this weekend's Lunar New Year celebrations. Investors are now beginning to worry about the outbreak's impact on the Chinese economy, which is widely considered the growth engine of the global economy.
 The Dow closed down 0.6%, or 170 points, logging its worst day since the start of the month. The index benefited from an afternoon turnaround of Boeing's stock, which finished up 1.7%, after the Federal Aviation Administration said Boeing's struggling 737 Max jet could regain regulatory approval before the summer.
 Still, it was the worst week for the Dow since mid-August.
 The broader S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite both ended 0.9% lower. The S&P saw its worst one-day percentage drop since early October, while the Nasdaq had its lowest close since early December.

When asked by WWNY-TV/7 News to comment on problems highlighted by the state comptroller’s office about how he conducted business while in office, former Canton Town Supervisor David T. Button had an interesting response.
 “In the north country, municipalities have a tendency to do things a bit loose,” he said, according to a story published Jan. 15 by the news organization.
 That’s a euphemistic way of saying that he and other town officials didn’t always follow the rules. That’s very disturbing. What’s worse is that Mr. Button ignored the law when it came to financial decisions that affected him and his wife.
 Mr. Button became embroiled in a controversy in 2017 when Town Board members questioned his decision to increase his own salary without authorization. His wife, Ann Denice Button, retired as the town bookkeeper in 2015 and began drawing on her state pension. However, she continued working in her husband’s office as his personal secretary.
 Astonishingly, Mr. Button then diverted most of her wages to his paycheck. When called on the carpet for this, he justified the move by saying that he had taken over many of his wife’s duties.
 The major problem is that Mr. Button was receiving a salary that wasn’t approved by the Town Board or advertised publicly as required by law. He said that at some point board members reached a consensus on the move, although he acknowledges that they never officially approved it. But there’s no documentation that any such discussion ever took place.
 The board scheduled a public hearing in August 2017 to solicit feedback from the public on the idea of raising Mr. Button’s salary from $14,977 to $40,000 through the end of the year. But when residents showed up for the meeting, they were told that everything had been worked out — in secret!
 Board members announced that Mr. Button agreed to pay $73,794.16 back to the town for the money he had received illegally. But the same time, residents were informed that the town would compensate Mrs. Button $58,857.62 for work she had performed over the past few years.
 This was outrageous. Mr. Button had set the wages his wife earned after she officially retired, and she agreed to continue working for the amount offered.
 Town Board members asked the state comptroller’s office to review the situation and report on what it found. The audit showed a pattern of dubious decisions.
 Mr. Button’s advertised salary was $14,256 for 2015, $14,612 for 2016 and $14,977 for 2017. But he paid himself $32,590, $51,269 and $33,780 for those three years, respectively.
 By law, he cannot be paid more than what has been advertised. The board must approve the wages paid to those in his office. And he had no legal authority to name himself as the town bookkeeper; any additional work he performs must be done in his capacity as supervisor.
 Mr. Button tried to raise his salary before he retired. The state pension system averages the three-highest annual salaries of all the years of service rendered by government employees. If he kept this higher salary for at least three years, he would have received a cushier pension when he left office.
 But voters decided they had seen enough of his antics. In the 2017 general election, they gave him a pink slip. Mary Ann Ashley took over this position.
 The state audit confirms the deceptive moves that Mr. Button tried to slip past residents. We can’t afford to have public officials “do things a bit loose” when it comes to overseeing government operations. Vigilance on everyone’s part is essential to ensure laws are upheld and taxpayer money is allocated wisely.

A police officer in Newport News, Virginia, died after a car drove away during a traffic stop and dragged her, police said.
 Officer Katie Thyne and another officer responded to a drug complaint Thursday evening and conducted a stop on a car. After the officers asked the driver to step out of the car, the driver accelerated, dragging Thyne for about a block, Newport News Police Chief Steve Drew told reporters on Friday.
 The car then crashed into a tree, leaving Thyne pinned between the car's door and the tree, Drew said. The officer suffered multiple injuries and was taken to a local hospital, where she was pronounced dead, police said in a statement.
 "She was a true hero and served this community," Drew said. "She is and will always be a valued member of the department."
 Thyne, who was from New Hampshire, joined the department in 2018 after serving in the US Navy, Drew said.
 She is survived by her 2-year old daughter, her mother, brother, stepfather and her partner, the police chief said.
 "This is what she wanted to do. She wanted to be in law enforcement and she wanted to do it in this city," said Drew, sobbing.
 Outside the police department, Thyne helped coaching a children's basketball team, the police chief added.
 The driver, Vernon Evander Green, was arrested shortly after the crash. The 38-year-old has been charged with homicide, evade and elude law enforcement and drug possession, police said.
 It's unclear whether Green has an attorney, according to online court records.

Reduced to the rank of a common soldier with the entire naval hierarchy above him, Yi contemplates "the moment when the enemy fleet would swoop in once again on the dark crest of waves from the other side of the murmurous horizon, wings spread wide, bearing a mountain of guns and swords. I could not fathom the source of the enemy’s rancor and the enemy had no way of knowing the quivering depths of my own rancor. The sea was taut, swollen with a rancor that neither side could hope to penetrate. But that was all I had for the time being — no fleet, only my rancor." It is this bitter emotion — not a dream of heroism, not love for his people, and certainly not loyalty to his king — that motivates Yi to face and and beat back the Japanese ships until he meets his death, a death about whose proper manner and location he becomes increasingly obsessive.

WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon disclosed on Friday that 34 U.S. service members suffered traumatic brain injuries in Iran's missile strike this month on an Iraqi air base, and although half have returned to work, the casualty total belies President Donald Trump's initial claim that no Americans were harmed. He later characterized the injuries as "not very serious."
   
 Eight of the injured arrived in the United States on Friday from Germany, where they and nine others had been flown days after the Jan. 8 missile strike on Iraq's Ain al-Asad air base. The nine still in Germany are receiving treatment and evaluation at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, the largest U.S. military hospital outside the continental United States.
   
 Jonathan Hoffman, the chief Pentagon spokesman, said the eight in the U.S. will be treated at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, or at their home bases. The exact nature of their injuries and their service and unit affiliations were not disclosed.
   
 Trump had initially said he was told that no troops had been injured in the strike, which Iran carried out as retaliation for a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad that killed Iran's most powerful general, Qassem Soleimani, on Jan. 3. The military said symptoms of concussion or traumatic brain injury were not immediately reported after the strike and in some cases became known days later. Many were in bunkers before nearly a dozen Iranian ballistic missiles exploded.
   
 The question of American casualties took on added importance at the time of the Iranian strike because the degree of damage was seen as influencing a U.S. decision on whether to counterattack and risk a broader war with Iran. Trump chose not to retaliate, and the Iranians then indicated their strike was sufficient for the time being. Tensions have since eased.
   
 After the Pentagon reported on Jan. 17 that 11 service members had been evacuated from Iraq with concussion-like symptoms, Trump said, "I heard they had headaches and a couple of other things … and I can report it is not very serious." He said he did not consider the injuries to be as severe as those suffered by troops who were hit by roadside bombs in Iraq.
   
 Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat and former Army Ranger, called on Trump to apologize.
   
 "TBI is a serious matter," Reed said in a statement. "It is not a 'headache,' and it's plain wrong for President Trump to diminish their wounds. He may not have meant to disrespect them, but President Trump's comments were an insult to our troops. He owes them an apology."
   
 Traumatic brain injury, or TBI, has become a bigger concern for the military in recent years as medical science improves its understanding of its causes and effects on brain function. It can involve varying degrees of impairment of thinking, memory, vision, hearing and other functions. The severity and duration of the injury can vary widely.
   
 The Defense Department has said more than 375,000 incidents of TBI occurred in the military between the years 2000 and 2018.
   
 Jefferson Kinney, a neuroscience researcher at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, where he is chair of the department of brain health, said Friday that much remains to be learned about TBI, including its effects on behavior.
   
 "It depends a lot on how severe the damage is and where the damage is," among other factors, he said. "There is huge variability across individuals. Some people will undergo a trauma that they seem to recover from very quickly, and others seem to be much more impacted by it for a longer duration."
   
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says a severe TBI may lead to death or result in an extended period of coma or amnesia.
   
 Hoffman's disclosure that 34 had been diagnosed with TBI was the first official update of the number injured since the Pentagon announced the evacuation of the first 11. On Jan. 21, officials said more had been sent out of Iraq for further diagnosis and treatment.
   
 But the Pentagon declined to provide firm figures or say whether any had been returned to duty.
   
 Hoffman said that of the 34 with TBI, 18 were evacuated from Iraq to U.S. medical facilities in Germany and Kuwait, and 16 stayed in Iraq. The one American sent to Kuwait has since returned to duty in Iraq. All 16 who stayed in Iraq have since returned to duty there, Hoffman said.
   
 No one was killed in the attack on Ain al-Asad, even though the U.S. had no missile defense systems there to protect from potential attack. Hoffman said Friday that deploying one or more Patriot anti-missile systems to Iraq is among options now being weighed by military commanders. The U.S. had deployed numerous Patriot systems to other countries in the region as protection against Iranian missile attack, including in Saudi Arabia, but a strike on Iraq was seen as less likely.
   
 Some members of Congress this week pressed the Pentagon for more clarity on the scope of the TBI cases resulting from the Iranian attack. Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., founder of the Congressional Brain Injury Task Force, wrote to senior Pentagon officials on Thursday requesting additional details on casualties from the attack.
   
 On Friday morning, Defense Secretary Mark Esper directed the Pentagon's acting undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, Matthew Donovan, to begin working with the staff of the Joint Chiefs to review how military injuries are tracked and reported -- not just TBI cases but battlefield injuries of all kinds, Hoffman told reporters.
   
 "The goal is to be as transparent, accurate, and to provide the American people and our service members with the best information about the tremendous sacrifices our war fighters make," Hoffman said.

Not every athlete advocate is wildly cheering the move, though.
 Olympic swimmer Nancy Hogshead-Makar is a member of “Team Integrity,” a group of 170 former Olympians and Paralympians, coaches and elite athletes lobbying for a near complete tear-down and rebuild of the Olympic committee, starting with fundamental changes to the congressional act that founded it in 1978.
 While the USOPC’s deal to boost funding for the advisory council is a positive step, the investment just doesn’t add up to the kind of commitment that’s needed to create a true “athlete first” culture, said Hogshead-Makar, who won three gold medals and a silver medal at the 1984 Summer Games.
 After factoring in other expenses, such as travel, she worries the remaining annual funds won’t be enough to hire a leader whose voice can compete at the highest levels of an organization that, according to IRS tax filings, brought in $336 million in revenue in 2016.
 “That $525,000 is a huge increase (in the previous amount of AAC funding) ... but think of the whole budget,” said Hogshead-Makar, a lawyer and founder of Champion Women, a nonprofit that advocates for gender equality in sports. “In no way will the person that they hire be at the same professional standing as the other executives at the USOPC. It’s not even in the same standing as the severance pay.”
 Hirshland took over the top job in 2018 for an annual salary of $600,000, with the potential of earning a 50% bonus.
 Former chief exec Scott Blackmun, who was widely criticized for his inaction during the sexual assault crisis, received $2.4 million in severance after resigning for health reasons in 2018.

A changing climate has contributed to “exceptional" breeding conditions, said Nairobi-based climate scientist Abubakr Salih Babiker.
 Migrating with the wind, the locusts can cover up to 150 kilometers (93 miles) in a single day. They look like tiny aircraft lazily crisscrossing the sky.
 They are now heading toward Uganda and fragile South Sudan, where almost half the country faces hunger as it emerges from civil war. Uganda has not had such an outbreak since the 1960s and is already on alert.
 The locusts also are moving steadily toward Ethiopia’s Rift Valley, the breadbasket for Africa’s second-most populous country, the U.N. says.
 “The situation is very bad but farmers are fighting it in the traditional way,” said Buni Orissa, a resident of Ethiopia’s Sidama region. “The locusts love cabbage and beans. This may threaten the shaky food security in the region.”
 Even before this outbreak, nearly 20 million people faced high levels of food insecurity across the East African region long challenged by periodic droughts and floods.
 As exasperated farmers look for more help in fighting one of history's most persistent pests, the FAO's Locust Watch offers little consolation.
 “Although giant nets, flamethrowers, lasers and huge vacuums have been proposed in the past, these are not in use for locust control,” the U.N. agency says. “People and birds often eat locusts but usually not enough to significantly reduce population levels over large areas.”
 Still, it offered recipes. One suggested seasoning in Uganda is chopped onion and curry powder. Then fry.
