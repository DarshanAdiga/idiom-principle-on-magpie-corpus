 ## 7\. You're focused too much on the money
 You obviously need money to survive. And you kind of need it to engage in hobbies. At the same time, research from Sanford DeVoe of the University of Toronto and Jeffrey Pfeffer of Stanford found that those with higher-incomes feel more time-crunched.
 As explained in The Economist; "Once hours are financially quantified, people worry more about wasting, saving, or using them profitably. When economies grow and incomes rise, everyone's time becomes more valuable. And the more valuable something becomes, the scarcer it seems."
 Moreover, DeVoe and Pfeffer found that just the perception of affluence can make you feel like you don't have enough time. So, while you should certainly make a comfortable living, you also don't need to be obsessed about it.

The Manikyavilakam ward of the city Corporation continues to be a thorn in the flesh for the Left Democratic Front (LDF) which had announced candidates for all wards much in advance. The LDF constituent party Indian National League (INL) has refused to change its candidate Poonthura Siraj, former vice president of the People's Democratic Party (PDP) who recently joined them, even though the CPI(M) had on Sunday conveyed its displeasure at his candidature and demanded that the INL look for an alternative.
 The INL district committee has decided that Mr. Siraj would be their candidate. If the CPI(M) continues to oppose, the INL will stay away from contesting.
 “Today, we had a talk with the CPI(M) leadership. We told them that if we are contesting Siraj would be the candidate. We were allocated only the Manikyavilakam ward in the Corporation. When we initially announced our district treasurer Kasim as the candidate, we were told that a candidate with a wider public acceptance should be found. That is why we zeroed in on Poonthura Siraj, who had earlier served many terms in the Corporation council. So, now if they are telling us to find another candidate, we cannot agree to that,” said J.Thamrook, INL district president, on Monday.
 Meanwhile, the United Democratic Front (UDF), which has been struggling to finalise candidates in five wards due to the presence of multiple contenders, announced its list of candidates on Monday evening, despite local-level opposition to some of the candidates.
 The Congress has fielded its candidates R.Anitha in Thampanoor, Edavakkode Ashokan in Edavakkode and Subair in Manikavilakam. In the Pattom ward, the previously announced candidate Goureesapattom Mohanan has been replaced with Charachira Rajeevan, after the former tested positive for COVID-19. In the Valiyavila ward, Kerala Congress (Jacob) has fielded T.Thara, while in Poonthura Kerala Congress (M) Joseph group has fielded Sruthimol Xavier.
 There has been much protest from the local leadership against the choice of candidates both in Edavakkode and Thampanoor. In Edavakkode, the Medical College and Edavakkode mandalam presidents had convened a meeting of Congress workers in protest against the District Congress Committee's decision to field Edavakkode Ashokan. The DCC had rejected the candidate proposed by the ward committee, leading to protests.
 In the Thampanoor ward, there was a dispute over the candidature of Ms.Anitha, whose name was suggested by a former councillor, which was opposed by the constituency committee, which had its own choice of a candidate. The dispute later led to a fight, in which a leader got injured too.

Lazy coworkers are, in a word, aggravating. Part of being a team player is pitching in and helping a colleague meet a crazy deadline, or taking on part of their workload when they need an extra hand. But that's supposed to be once in a while -- a favor, not a full-time job.
 If you're constantly doing someone else's work, it can be difficult to fulfill your own responsibilities, produce high-quality work and go above and beyond. It could even be the difference between a promotion and staying stagnant.
 And as helpful as you want to be, if your willingness to help turns into an everyday occurrence, you're being taken advantage of. It may be time to say something. "Follow the rule of three to make sure you're dealing with a pattern and not an incident," said Leigh Steere, cofounder of the Boulder- based management training tool Managing People Better. "If it happens once, let it go; twice, make a mental note; three times, you have to deal with it,"

Switzerland’s State Secretary Krystyna Marty held political dialogue via videoconference with China’s Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Qin Gang. The talk focused on economic relations, human rights situation in China as well as Covid-19 pandemic situation. During the dialogue, Switzerland, China’s third largest trading partner, expressed concerns about the “lack of respect for human rights in China” especially the treatment of Tibetans by the Chinese authorities. This comes in the backdrop of Beijing based Swiss Ambassador Bernardino Regazzoni’s visit to Tibet between this September which was the first official Swiss visit since 2017. In a statement on the visit, the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs noted that the Swiss Ambassador along with other ten diplomatic missions visited Lhasa and Shigatse and took the opportunity to address important issues such as human rights situation with the local government. In terms of trade relations, China is Switzerland’s third-largest trading partner with CHF 36 billion. Switzerland has also signed a memorandum of understanding for cooperation on trade, investment and finance for projects in third countries along the routes of the Belt and Road Initiative in 2019. However, China has indefinitely postponed the Human Rights Dialogue with Switzerland due to be held in 2019 after Switzerland co-signed a letter to the UN along with 21 other countries criticizing China’s concentration camps in East Turkestan.

Unexpectedly, we also found that following conversion, neuroinflammation was reduced, new blood vessels emerged, and blood-brain-barrier was restored, leading to new neural tissue composed of new neurons, new astrocytes, and new blood vessels in the injury site", said the first author Dr. Lei Zhang excitingly about her work.

Okay. Can you opine a little bit about whatever visibility and information you have or handle and call it, the ramp-up timing of where you are in the pecking order of supplying products that are used by suppliers to Boeing and Boeing itself regarding what seems to be now a greater visibility on the timing. It seems as if the 737 MAX is going to get approval fairly globally, not just in the U.S. in the very near future to return to flight. Then there will be the train. American Airlines announced this last week, they believe they will have 737 MAXs, assuming the approval comes in the next week or two that they will have 737 MAXs some of them in the air by the end of the year. Obviously, other airlines and everyone else, based on simulator re-certifications, training pilots and all the other stuff, that’s going to be a Q1, Q2 thing where they are going to start doing that. They got to fly the planes and get everything going before they can then apparently start delivering what they have built up in their inventory, but they also would have their production line starting to do their thing. In this kind of time horizon, I have kind of described that is known right now. What – how do you kind of foresee the timing of when you start getting the phone calls and the ramp-up of making some incremental sales in your aerospace segment from this?
