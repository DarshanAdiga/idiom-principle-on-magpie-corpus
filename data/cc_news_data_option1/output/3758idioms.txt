Lyle M. Clark      August 20, 1922 - September 3, 2020      Lyle M. Clark was born on a sweltering August day in Washington D.C. and was relieved at age two when his family moved to the Seattle area where he spent the remainder of his life.      In 1940 Lyle graduated from Roosevelt High School and went on to attend the University of Washington where he was a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. His college years were interrupted by his enlistment in the U.S. Army during World War II. After his service he returned to the UW where he completed his degree and his outstanding track and field career. He was the Pacific Coast Conference champion in high and low hurdles, was twice named captain of the Husky track team, and placed in four national track meets. Lyle married the love of his life, Mary Jo Jahant in 1946. They were together for 69 years until her passing in 2015.      In 1950 Lyle founded Clark Stationary, which later became Clark Office Products, a mainstay of Lake City business. He was a long-time member of Rotary International. Lyle loved boating, all things Husky sports, Kauai, serving COP's customers, and most of all his family and friends.      Lyle is survived by his children Lyle M. (Skip) Clark Jr. (Patricia), Dean Clark (Susan), and Victoria Clark Carlson (David), also 7 grandchildren and 10 great grandchildren. Lyle was a devoted and generous husband, father and grandfather and he will be greatly missed.

Since March, the coronavirus pandemic has had many of us on edge and concerned about our health. We are learning more about the virus every day, but as a new virus, we still do not know all there is to know about the virus and its long- term effects.
 The good news is, we can all take steps to keep ourselves and others healthy with a number of simple steps.

       With a rapidly prospering China, the road of confrontation which the current Australian government has chosen for itself against China won't be an easy trek, and will very likely prove to be a dead end for Canberra. The decades- long mutually beneficial economic relationship between the two countries is gone.      With a declining economy and jobs evaporating by tens of thousands, Prime Minister Scott Morrison's administration has run itself into a corner. Canberra should have attempted to uphold a friendly relationship with China, its largest trade partner consuming approximately one third of Australia's annual exports.      But Canberra has bucked the logic, instead racking up animosity and increasingly showing hostility toward Beijing.      Recently, Australian intelligence officers stormed into and forcibly searched the residences of a group of Chinese journalists stationed there, hastening the unraveling of already fraught relations between the two countries. Chinese students and diaspora have also been targeted with their personal safety being threatened in a wave of rising racism.      In recent times, many Chinese see Canada under the Justin Trudeau's administration and Australia under the Morrison's administration as two of the most unfriendly countries toward China. Australia and Canada, two close associates of the Five Eyes alliance, created and led by Washington, are actually in the "vanguard" of the US President Donald Trump government's containment strategy against China.      Chinese tech firm Huawei -- a shining light illuminating high-tech research and innovations in China has been highly valued and respected. Since 2012, to prevent China from catching up with the US in a technology race, the US government has meted out a slew of incessantly restricting and coercive measures to harass and destroy Huawei's growth. With Trump coming to power in 2017, the US has launched the most relentless attack on Huawei yet.      To support Trump's bare-knuckled assault to destroy the Chinese high-tech company, Canberra and Ottawa, two staunch accomplices of the US government, were the first two governments in the world to suppress Huawei.      In mid-2018, Canberra was the first to echo the US' bullying policy, announcing Australia will exclude Huawei's 5G from its future networks; and later that year the Canadian government, in a clandestine and despicable conspiracy with the US' FBI, seized Huawei's top executive Meng Wanzhou at the Vancouver International Airport on her way to Mexico, and Ottawa has refused to let her go home until this day.      In addition to attacking Huawei, in July this year, Canberra wrote a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, stating that Australia does not recognize China's building of islands on reefs in the South China Sea, which is a serious provocative act against  China's territorial integrity. China has exercised effective jurisdiction over relevant islands, reefs, and waters in the South China Sea for thousands of years, which have been clearly outlined in the historical Nine-Dash demarcation lines.      Once again, Canberra chose to follow on the heels of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who said earlier in July that China's claims across most of the South China Sea were "unlawful."      Some Chinese experts say that the pains felt by Chinese people are indelible, and they will work hard to build up China's economic and military capabilities.      Now on the political level, there is a consensus that China-Australia relations have sunk to their lowest ebb in many decades.      Canberra's half-baked effort to "reset" relations with Beijing is laughable, provided it continues to dig its head in the sand over the two premium issues of Huawei and the South China Sea.      Australia exports billions of dollars of mineral resources and agricultural products to China every year, which contributes significantly to Australia's affluence. However, the constantly souring relations have led to declining exports of barley, wine and beef to China.      If Canberra stubbornly follows in the steps of the US government to contain China, its exports of wool, iron ore, coal and gas, which make up a big proportion of its annual sales to this country, will feel the pinch.      China hawks in the Australian government say they will diversify from exporting to China, setting a goal to send A$45 billion ($32.8 billion) in yearly exports to India by 2035. But in 2019, Australia exported $103.9 billion to China. The smaller market just doesn't have a big appetite for Australian goods, like China's.      Those in Australia who have far-sighted vision about China-Australia ties need to ratchet up pressure on Canberra to change its hardline policy toward Beijing, and not always work hand in hand with the US' government to harm China.       _The author is an editor with the Global Times.bizopinion@globaltimes.com.cn_

Fundamental to the Unity 2020 ethos is the belief that the country faces certain doom if either President Donald Trump or Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden wins the election in November. The idea, then, is that a "patriotic" bipartisan ticket can save the day.


--DocBreak--
“The newer people and younger people are more likely to identify as Democrats,” said Andrew Smith, a University of New Hampshire pollster, “as the younger people look to that party and some older people either die or move to Florida.”
 But New Hampshire also is ground zero for both parties’ efforts to draw new voters into the polling booths in November — a critical task for Trump, whose strategists believe there is a hidden force of potential new voters who can carry him over the line, just as it is for Biden, whose strategists believe that mobilizing the young and attracting voters, particularly Independents, disillusioned with Trump’s style and comportment, could be the margin of his victory.
 “The biggest bloc of voters in this state is Independents,” said James M. Demers, a prominent Democratic activist and lobbyist, “and they’re very concerned about what they’ve seen in the president.”
 That surge of new voters may not be a mirage. The state’s primary, conducted a day after Labor Day, drew a record turnout. A study by the Carsey School of Public Policy at the University of New Hampshire found that migrants into the state and those turning 18 in the past four years represent 230,000 potential new voters, or about 20% of those eligible to vote in 2020.
 Like everything else in this state’s politics, the contest could come down to a measure of the popularity of a figure named Sununu and another named Shaheen.
 Jeanne Shaheen has been a prominent figure in the state’s politics since she helped engineer the upset 1984 New Hampshire primary victory of Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado. She was the first female governor of the state and then the first female senator from the state. Altogether she has been in office for nearly three decades.
 Chris Sununu is the third member of his family to win statewide elections; his father, John H. Sununu, was elected governor three times before becoming White House chief of staff to President George H.W. Bush, and his brother served in both the House and Senate. Shaheen defeated that brother, Sen. John E. Sununu, twice in senatorial races.
 Both Shaheen, a cinch to win a fourth term in the Senate, and the youngest Sununu, regularly in the ranks of the most popular governors in the country, are on the ballot this November.
 The latest Siena College/New York Times poll has Biden ahead by 3 percentage points, but the New England skepticism that has animated this state for centuries is particularly appropriate in this 21st-century contest. No one really knows who is ahead.
 “It is impossible for the polls to accurately reflect a race in which Donald Trump is the candidate,” said former Gov. John H. Sununu, the paterfamilias of the Sununu clan. On that, if on nothing else, all the state’s politicos agree.

Also, I’ve come to appreciate the effectiveness of dish soap on insects – all types of insects flying or crawling. A short spritz on flying insects - including bees and wasps – changes their plans and puts an end to their diabolical ways. For ants, it also destroys their scent trails so other industrious agitators cannot follow.
 Like a madman I kept up the spraying duties until I had won the war, but what if I were to run out of soapy water and more ants volunteered for duty? Perish the thought and into town for more dish soap – just in case.
 After some exploring and a solitary meal around the campfire, I zipped myself into the cozy shelter for the night. But, sometime in the hours of darkness, I was awakened by some type of commotion close at hand. Camp raiders in the form of raccoons, I surmised, were frolicking in my stuff left outside. I was simply too comfortable and warm to go out and run them off, so I just made some noise from within and it seemed to work.
 At first light, I could see my metal-clad cooler had been breached and the lid was wide open; apparently, it’s better not to be lazy and to snap the latches closed than to leave the invitation accessible to intruders. Although they made a mess of things, I found they only ran off with my raw breakfast sausage and scrambled a few raw eggs. I policed the site for remnants of their raid and picked up wrappers from the trash bag, also left outdoors for their entertainment. Lessons learned.
 And you thought this was going to be about hunting.

A darne notizia è la Fiom Cgil: "A risultare positivo - dice Francesco Foti, segretario della Fiom di Palermo - è un dipendente dell'amministrazione. La conferma è arrivata dalla stessa azienda, ma solo dopo la nostra richiesta, allarmati dagli operai che ieri erano venuti a conoscenza del caso di contagio". Alcuni giorni fa il dipendente ha partecipato a un compleanno, dove e' stato riscontrato un caso di Covid. L'Asp di Palermo si è messa subito sulle tracce dei partecipanti alla festa. Tra questi c'era anche il dipendente Sirti che è stato sottoposto a tampone. "La società ribadisce con forza - dicono dalla Sirti - di aver attivato con prontezza tutte le stringenti procedure previste in caso di positività di un lavoratore, informando immediatamente il Rappresentante della Sicurezza dei Lavoratori dell'area competente, il responsabile e l'addetto del Servizio di Prevenzione e Protezione, nonché i colleghi che potevano avere avuto contatto con il lavoratore stesso - invitandoli a seguire i protocolli previsti - e provvedendo anche alla sanificazione dei propri uffici".

Come September, the United Nations (UN) shifts gears. Open spaces at its premises give way to tightly-configured booths for backroom diplomacy. The General Assembly Hall becomes a platform for public diplomacy. This combination of hushed conversations in backrooms and loud proclamations from public platforms attracts more than 100 Heads of State and governments. These dual forms of diplomatic endeavours make the "High Level Week" or the "Leaders' Week" unique. While the rhetoric of the "General Debate" makes for media headlines, it is individual and group meetings, away from the limelight, that add ballast. This year, things will be different. As the UN marks its 75th anniversary, all events will be largely virtual. After much speculation that United States (US) President Donald Trump may use the physical pulpit, he too, like most leaders opted to send a video. This is awaited with some trepidation. There is talk of announcements that could trigger a crisis at UN, as the US seeks to enforce "snap back" UN sanctions against Iran. The schedule provides for a 75th anniversary commemorative event on September 21. The "General Debate" begins on September 22 and ends on 29. A summit on biodiversity is on September 30. The 25th anniversary of the World Conference on Women (Beijing + 25) is on October 1. With concerns aplenty, a virtual talk fest is in store. However, the usual allure will be missing.This at a time when global deaths from Covid-19 infections are comparable to that of major wars and unemployment is worse than at anytime since the Great Depression. The virus has exposed the failings of existing global arrangements. Some say that a globalised world without effective global platforms has made the virus more lethal. After all, the spread was accelerated by global connectivity. The adverse impacts have caused economic slumps, stoking States to focus internally, reducing international cooperation. Existing geopolitical tensions have exacerbated and global mistrust worsened. The global order is infected, with no vaccine for its ills is in sight. Historically, acute disorder provides opportunities for change. Crises catalyse states to rise above inertia, myopia, and narrow self-interest. The Peace of Westphalia in 1648; the Congress of Vienna in 1815; the Treaty of Versailles in 1919; and conferences at Bretton Woods and San Francisco in the 1940s followed crises. No peace-time crisis, even a "crisis like none other" that we now confront, has changed a global order. Hence, diplomats have banked on the resilience of the existing system and kicked the can of reform down the road. The 75th anniversary declaration, agreed amid the pandemic, provides for the UN Secretary General to "report back before the end of the 75th session of the General Assembly with recommendations to respond to current and future challenges." Sometime in 2021, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will take a stab at suggesting a recalibration of the multilateral system in keeping with the session's goal of, "The future we want, the United Nations we need". For now, he will share the concerns and findings of consultations with civil society groups across the globe, including a global online Pew survey. The statements of leaders will be inputs for him to reflect on in future submissions.From an Indian perspective, this comes when Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi, is displaying more of an internationalist orientation than our leaders have exhibited since the end of the Cold War. During the 50th anniversary of the UN in 1995, the then PM PV Narasimha Rao spent five days in New York. He met five or six leaders bilaterally, and spoke once for the specified five minutes. In contrast, at last year's "Leaders Week", the PM maximised bilateral meetings, principally with those who he had not engaged otherwise and had several pluri-lateral and multilateral conversations on global issues including the climate crisis, health, Sustainable Development Goals and cyber-security. For the first time, an Indian PM hosted an event at the UN to commemorate an Indian -- Mahatma Gandhi. Some among us view the UN from an India-Pakistan prism. For example, after PM Imran Khan's diatribe at the General Debate last year, Pakistani diplomats made statements against India in various General Assembly forums during the course of the year, without a single supportive statement from anyone else. The UN is a platform to address global issues. The global order is faltering in addressing transnational dangers of conflict, terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, pandemics, climate crisis, cyber-security, and poverty. Advocating change of a status quo in turmoil, is a global good. Yet, there is no coherent vision of change. For India, the principal utility of the session is the opportunity to articulate the why, what, when and how of our conception of "Reformed Multilateralism" and work with others on reinvigorating multilateralism. We need to be beneficent in contributing to rejuvenate multilateralism, before we can be beneficiaries of it. Else, international cooperation and the global public good that we take for granted will decline, and, we will all be poorer for it.Syed Akbaruddin served as India's Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York The views expressed are personal

 Chinese tech giant Tencent has reportedly picked Singapore as its Asian hub, considering the shift of some business operations - including international game publishing - out of China. Likewise, TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance is reportedly planning to make Singapore its headquarters for the rest of Asia. Other Chinese tech companies including Huawei's cloud division, Alibaba's Ant Group and Haitong Securities also seek cooperation with local business organizations in Singapore.      Chinese tech companies "going out" approach is a part of their global expansion bids, in line with China's overall economic development strategy - the "dual circulation" plan. The trend started before the outbreak of the trade war and is expected to continue. It's also the inevitable development of Chinese tech enterprises.      Why do Chinese tech companies have to go out? In doing so, they can reduce the distance from their overseas users to achieve localization. In addition to seeking easier channels for raising investments, many tech companies chose to list in the US and Hong Kong stock markets in order to narrow the differences with their users.      "Going out" is also a part of spreading China's influence to the outside world. Chinese tech companies used to be followers of NASDAQ listed companies, but now China's internet, especially mobile internet, is advancing faster than the rest of the world, and the internet players in the Chinese market are as popular as those being copied abroad. The speed and influence of Chinese tech companies' success in going global is not what it used to be.      "Going out" is the best way to realize the "dual circulation" plan. The plan aims to develop the industrial chain, but the priority is still on the demand side. China has the largest domestic market, but that doesn't mean that companies can ignore the overseas market of 5.6 billion people.      Singapore and China have small cultural differences, similar administrative systems and lower communication costs. China's digital technology radiates across Southeast Asia with Singapore as the hub, and then continues to reach overseas markets in Southeast Asia. This is a more rational and safe choice in the current global geopolitical competition climate.      With the increase in the income and education level of domestic residents, the replacement of new for old industries is inevitable. Companies that were at the end of the industry chain in the past will develop upstream. As a part of this process, Chinese tech companies can serve as bridges to provide industrial chain extensions for the internal circulation of manufacturing companies, such as developing financial services, cross-border e-commerce, or providing convenient solutions for cross-border logistics.      Chinese tech companies' global approach is the prevailing way. If more and more people use Chinese social media apps and play games developed by Chinese companies, Chinese tech companies will become more and more important internationally. Of course, before this happens, Chinese companies need to work hard to achieve localization overseas, place their international business centers closer to users and serve them well, so that they do not have any worries in the future.

Authorities in Uttarakhand's Rudrapur area have converted a banquet hall into a temporary Covid care centre for prisoners to house 73 inmates who tested positive for Covid-19 in the central jail in Sitarganj on Thursday.


  Two elderly Covid-19 positive prisoners from Sitarganj Jail have also died at Susheela Tiwari Government Hospital Haldwani in the last three days. They were admitted in the hospital last week where their Covid-19 tests were carried out.


  "Prisoners who tested Covid-19 positive on Thursday have been housed in a banquet hall in Rudrapur. Health officials are conducting Covid-19 test on the rest of the prisoners in jail," said Dadhi Ram Maurya, superintendent, central jail, Sitarganj.


  Sitarganj jail has around 700 prisoners. Samples are being collected for the rest of the prisoners for RT-PCR test.


   


   


  "So far 337 samples have been collected in the last two days after the 73 prisoners tested positive", said Maurya.


  "Two teams of the health officials are collecting samples of the prisoners after 73 prisoners tested positive. This is the third round of testing in the jail. Earlier in March and August, samples were collected since the outbreak started in the state," he said.


  The jail superintendent said the entire prison premise is being sanitized twice a day as a precautionary measure. "Entry and exit from jail premises has been absolutely restricted to curb the further spread of the virus. Social distancing is also being maintained by prisoners in jail," he said.


  Two elderly Covid-19 positive prisoners from Sitarganj Jail have also died at Susheela Tiwari Government Hospital Haldwani in the last three days.


  "They were admitted for treatment in the last week at the hospital in Haldwani. Later, they tested positive for Covid-19. The two prisoners included a 76-year- old prisoner who hailed from Kunwarpur Sisaiyan village and an 86-year-old prisoner, who was from Bichai village. Both these villages fall under Nanakmatta police station in Udham Singh Nagar district," said Maurya

In the first episode, a former student, now a police detective, pulls him into a campus rape case strangely similar to one years earlier, which involved a friend of hers, and Professor Teerlinck becomes a regular adviser to the homicide department, though not a universally welcome one.


  And the head of that department just happens to be T’s ex who cheated on him years ago, which apparently added to his mental issues.


  In the third season, T lands in prison for killing a police detective in cold blood and finds himself sharing a cell for a few episodes with a psychopathic killer he helped capture in the first season who, instead of holding a grudge, becomes his Watson.


  “Professor T” ran in its native Belgium for three seasons (39 one-hour episodes 2015-2018). Just a year after it first began there, a French version set in Nantes was made (one season, six episodes), but it didn’t turn up on French television until 2018. It did, however, screen in Belgium in 2016 — which would seem to mean that Belgians that year could choose between the original in Flemish and another in French.


  In 2017, a German version set in Cologne, which finished its fourth season just this past June (with four episodes per season). In 2018, the Czech Republic ran an eight-episode remake set in Prague. And this summer, England was to begin shooting another “Professor T” clone set in Cambridge.


  The complete Belgian series is available through Amazon Prime Video on its PBS pay channel, as are the first two seasons of the German version on its MHz pay channel.


  The Belgian version can also be seen (or DVR’ed) on WILL-TV at 2 a.m. (!) Thursday mornings. The eight available German episodes correspond to roughly the first seven episodes of the Belgian series but with clear indicators that it will diverge significantly from the original by killing off characters who survived there. (The German professor also favors a more austere décor accentuated by Japanese details and listens to electronic music that would paralyze his Belgian self.) The French and Czech versions are not available in the U.S. yet.


  I’ve seen all the Belgian and German episodes available here and hope the French, Czech and British versions eventually turn up, too. It’s fascinating to see how different countries and cultures handle the same material, and I’m sure there must be several media studies dissertations in progress on the various “Professor T” series.


  If you enjoy the “neurotic eccentric genius solving murders” meme, any of these series should interest you. And if you’ve spent any time on a university or college campus, you will find the academic segments of each episode particularly amusing.


  You will undoubtedly have encountered a faculty member with at least some of Professor T’s quirks. I’ve known several myself.

The same philosophy applies to routers. If you plan upon limited Wi-Fi usage and/or live in a small home or apartment, an $80 router works as well as a $300 router.


  If you’re among a family of five and/or live in a 3,000-square-foot or larger home, then you definitely need greater capability than offered by most $100 routers. Nearly all routers include four hard-wired Ethernet ports as well as Wi-Fi.


  Be sure to choose a tri-band router model for best performance and flexibility. Generally, but not always, more expensive routers deliver faster Wi-Fi performance. A few new models, such as one from TP-Link, promise the latest Wi-Fi 6 in $100 models.


  A few brand names crop up repeatedly on reputable electronics websites. Asus, D-Link, Netgear and TP-Link Archer all sell $65-$85 models highly rated by PC Magazine and a few other online sources.


  If you want to do your own research, visit pcmag.com, cnet.com, tomshardware.com and thewirecutter.com (the latter from the New York Times).


  If you live in a large house, consider a mesh router. Usually a three-piece set, these distribute the Wi-Fi signal evenly throughout your home. Some models, such as from Asus, Netgear and D-Link, serve as both conventional routers and/or mesh routers. Simply go into the configuration menu and click a setting. Dedicated mesh router sets begin at about $150 for two modules or $170 for three and increase to about $600 for three or four. Most automatically configure themselves, although some require a little more setup knowledge. Nest, a Google subsidiary, Amazon eero, Asus and Netgear’s Orbi all receive favorable reviews.


  Although routers work right out of the box, immediately go into the configuration menu to change two critical settings: user name and password. All routers come with a prominently displayed web address (URL) in the packaging for accessing the configuration menu.


  Near all arrive with the user name admin or the brand name and either no password or a very simple one. Don’t name your router with your name or your street address. Choose something memorable but obscure to anyone other than your family. Then create a fiendishly difficult password or passphrase, mixing numbers and letters.

Merthyr Tydfil council leader Kevin O'Neill claimed on Saturday that some people in the area had "lost their discipline".


  Rates in Merthyr Tydfil over the past week have overtaken neighbouring Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT), which was placed in a local lockdown on Thursday.


  Wales' deputy chief medical officer Dr Chris Jones said there was evidence "people have become a little less concerned about the risk that the virus poses and are taking more risks in their everyday lives".


  "The crucial thing is that when somebody has symptoms, they isolate themselves from contact with others," he told BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement programme.


  "And that's quite a tough thing to do."


  He also said there was a lot of variation in the rate of transmission of the virus across Wales, with hotspots in the south.


  In light of the differing picture across the country, he said taking Wales- wide "measures may be disproportionate for people in areas where the virus is less troublesome".


  Most of Wales' Covid-19 tests are processed at UK-wide lighthouse labs, which are struggling to deal with a backlog of tests.

Mary Jean Nicholls Seattle, WAAugust 28, 1944 ~ July 25, 2020Mary Jean Nicholls, age 73, passed away peacefully in her home on July 25, with her husband, Jim Nicholls, by her side. Mary Jean was born and raised in Seattle, being the first of three siblings born to first generation Croatians. Her family heritage in Seattle dated back to the 1920s. She graduated from Lincoln High School, earned her AA degree at North Seattle Community College with honors, and completed her BA degree cum laude at Seattle University. As a young adult, Mary Jean became an airline stewardess and instantly fell in love with travel. She then shifted her focus to pursue a career in education and development, spending time with the Labor Relations Union at the University of Washington, and worked as a counseling secretary at Shorewood and Shorecrest high schools in the Shoreline School District. Mary Jean advocated for sex education and counseling in schools, highlighted by her formal presentation to the Shoreline school board. She had a deep empathetic quality with profound compassion for others. This remained a theme throughout her life, which ultimately led her advocacy for equality and social justice. Most notably, she was devoted to the NW AIDS Foundation and later became an Aids Walk coordinator and co-chair of the AIDS Awareness committee. It was an incredible honor for her to host the largest and most successful Aids walk in Seattle history. Mary Jean was also active in Seattle's Croatian community as a long- time member to the American Slavic Woman's Club, serving as secretary, board member, and scholarship committee chairperson. Her dedication will be remembered with gratitude. Mary Jean was most proud of being a mother to her son Jeffrey. She raised Jeffrey with love and compassion. She enjoyed cooking with her son and he loved learning how to make Thanksgiving dinner and all her favorite dishes. Jeffrey is extremely grateful to have been raised by Mary Jean and is incredibly proud to be her son. Mary Jean also held a special relationship with Dominic and Biagio, her two loving nephews. From the moment they we're born, Mary Jean cared for them as if they were her own, showering them with love and kindness, while instilling the importance of family and tradition. Children just loved Mary Jean. She was the second "Teta" (aunt) to the virtually every child in the neighborhood. Everyone knew her special drawer in kitchen and contained her special treats. Watching them mature was a special delight for Mary Jean and she cherished her time visiting with them.Later in life, Mary Jean continued with her love of travel. She learned about her Croatian ancestry first-hand by taking several trips to the Croatian coast and sailing through the Adriatic Sea. Favorite trips included visits to Montenegro, Albania, and Athens, Greece, and a month long trip driving through France while staying with relatives. Her favorite destination of all was Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, where she traveled her husband every February for over 20 years. While she had several difficult health challenges, her husband Jim provided continuous loving care and compassion. She always remained upbeat and utterly refused to complain. She handled every difficult health challenge with sheer determination, bravery, and grace. It is with deep gratitude that the family recognizes her on-going support and care from Evergreen Hospice and Dr. Samuel Nadler at the PolyClinic. She was the very heart of our family - a wonderful wife, mother, aunt, friend and neighbor. Mary Jean will live on through all the people she touched, remaining in our hearts and memories forever.Due to COVID 19 a private family celebration will be held.

Things seem to be going well in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic in Livingston County, at least that's what it seems after Jackie Dever provided an update at the Livingston County Board meeting on Thursday.


   


  Dever, the administrator at the Livingston County Health Department, informed the board about the work between the schools, businesses and testing that has been taking place.


   


  "They've been at school just a little over a month now and we're getting calls quite frequently, especially (at the beginning)," Dever said of dealing with the schools. "School nurses are doing a great job, as are the school administrators and nurses. I'm very pleased with how that's going."


   


  There have been some cases discovered, but not to the degree feared statewide when schools were allowed to open.


   


  As for bigger outbreaks, Dever said that the county has had two recently -- one at Pontiac Correctional Center and one at a long-term care facility. She also said that COVID-19 is spreading quickly through families.


   


  Testing has gone better than hoped when it started, Dever said. She pointed out that the test site at OSF Saint James-John W. Albrecht Medical Center is doing 40 tests a day.Hopefully, Dever added, the number will rise to 50.


   


  "It's going very, very smoothly, (I) couldn't ask for it to go any better," Dever said. "We kind of threw it together and were a little nervous, once we got it going it's going very well. (We're) getting results back within 24-48 hours, occasionally 72. OSF is amping up some if its testing, too.


   


  "We have noticed that (results) are coming through pretty well within a 48-hour period," Dever said. "If they have MyChart, which is the OSF system, the labs pop in there immediately. So they are finding out even before we know about them and can contact them."


   


  Dever also noted that a new machine is expected by OSF Healthcare in Peoria. Once up and running, it should increase the testing numbers.


   


  In regard to businesses, Dever said there have been very few complaints since the mask mandate was put in place. She said compliance is going well.


   


  There is the effort being made for mass vaccination taking place by the end of the year nationally. She added that it is likely not to happen until the first half of next year.


   


  There were 10,149 tests reported through Friday with 322 coming back positive. Of those, 12 were reported Friday with seven coming from PCC. There have been 17 new cases reported from the prison in recent days.


   


  There are 49 active cases, three of which were hospitalized. Three other hospitalizations were released Thursday, Dever reported to the county board. There have been five deaths related to COVID and 37 were asymptomatic when tested.


   


  Pontiac's number of cases made a big leap to reach 89. Dwight is sitting at 35 and Fairbury moved to 32 cases. Flanagan bumped up to 16 and Forrest remained at 15 cases. Cornell and Long Point each stayed at 13.


   


  Streator has had 349 cases. El Paso stayed at 29 and Minonk added two to move to 20. Chenoa and Lexington each added one to rise to 15 cases while Gridley stayed at 10 cases.


   


  Statewide, the IDPH reported Friday that 2,120 new cases were confirmed. There were also 20 COVID-related deaths reported. Overall, there have been 270,327 positive cases out of 4,982,856 tests since reporting began earlier this year. There have also been 8,411 deaths ranging in age from younger than 1 year to older than 100. The recovery rate is at 96 percent.


   


  Drive-thru COVID-19 testing has begun and will be available at OSF Saint James weekdays from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. in the parking lot. There are no requirements and all testing is at no charge to the client. Insurance will be billed, if available.


   


  Scheduling appointments is strongly recommended due to the limit of daily testing capacity. Contact the LCHD at (815) 844-7174, ext. 210, for appointments and questions.


   


  The LCHD reminds residents that symptoms are not always obvious apparent but that people can be carriers of COVID-19. Everyone is is encouraged to continue to adhere to all required precautions including wearing a face covering and maintaining a social distance of at least six feet whenever possible. Frequent hand-washing and sanitizing is still strongly urged.


   


  Individuals who travel to hot spots in the country are encouraged to get tested for COVID-19 five to seven days after returning home, or sooner if experiencing symptoms.


   


  For Livingston County residents age 60 or older, homebound with no assistance and in need of essential care items, such as food, medical supplies, or personal hygiene products, please the LCHD at 815-844-7174, x230. The LCHD will continue to work diligently to meet the everyday needs of county residents while aggressively addressing the on-going COVID-19 pandemic.

Ren Zhengfei
       Huawei is inviting professionals across China, from top research institutions to universities and companies, to join efforts in technological research as the Shenzhen-based technology giant tries to blaze a trail out of the US blockade.      Recently, Huawei executives including founder Ren Zhengfei, visited the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) to discuss fundamental research and core technology development with CAS experts and scholars. The visit came just weeks after Ren and his colleagues visited four Chinese top universities to enhance professional training.      During the visit, Ren said that Huawei attaches great importance to its cooperation with the CAS.      "Based on current cooperation between Huawei and the CAS, I hope the two sides can strengthen scientific exchanges with a more open attitude, while exploring the frontiers of science and technology, and pushing the conversion of research results into economic prowess," Ren said.      CAS dean Bai Chunli also noted that the CAS has carried out "multiple-layer", "broad" and "pragmatic" cooperation with Huawei, with this kind of teamwork having produced good results.      "I hope Huawei and the CAS can cooperate closely, combining the innovation abilities of CAS and the resources of Huawei to explore frontier technologies," Bai said.      The visit again showed Huawei's thirst for a solution following the US order limiting global supply of electronic components to the Chinese tech giant, analysts said.      "Huawei's current chip inventory can sustain its market share for about two years. After that, unless Huawei can come up with a good solution to obtain chip supplies, its market share might falter, which will be a threat to the brand's competitiveness and even survival," Sun Yanbiao, head of Shenzhen- based research firm N1mobile, told the Global Times on Sunday.      That means unless policy changes come from the US government, Huawei has to develop its own tech solutions within a rather short period, pushing it to seek cooperation with academic and research powers in China.      "It would be a win-win situation for Huawei and the CAS. The CAS can help Huawei with research equipment and R&D projects, while Huawei could support some CAS projects with capital," veteran industry analyst Ma Jihua told the Global Times.      According to him, there's no guarantee that input will yield results, but considering that China's chip technologies do not lag too far behind, it's hopeful that Huawei and its partners can work out independent tech solutions that can allow China to produce high-end chips by itself.      "Faced with the US crackdown, China needs to complete technological independence in just about one-tenth of the normal time needed for such a process to take place. But it has to try," Ma said.      He added that China is also demonstrating its determination in technological independence to the world, thus prompting US enterprises to exert pressure on the US government as they would experience great losses if China could make everything on its own and no longer needs to import products from the US.      Microsoft founder Bill Gates also questioned in a recent interview whether it is good to "force China to become fully self-sufficient", adding that cutting supplies to China would cause job losses and the US would sustain the most serious damage in the long run.

The death of liberal Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Friday could spell bad news for Democrats if a legal battle over the results of the Nov. 3 presidential election reaches the high court, as it did in 2000.If President Donald Trump, a Republican, is able to install a conservative replacement in time, the new justice could help resolve any dispute in favor of the president - an outcome that would deepen the country's partisan divide and threaten the court's reputation as an independent arbiter, some legal experts said."People's views of Bush v. Gore would be tame by comparison," said Joshua Douglas, a University of Kentucky law professor, referring to the controversial 2000 Supreme Court decision that effectively handed George W. Bush a victory. "It's almost unimaginable what the reaction would be."Before Ginsburg's death, the court had a 5-4 conservative majority, so even if her seat were to remain vacant, Democrats would need two conservative votes to avoid losing or a 4-4 tie in any post-election case.The 2020 campaign has already seen more election-related lawsuits than any other in recent memory, said Dale Ho, who runs the voting rights project at the American Civil Liberties Union. Many of the cases are focused on whether to expand voting options amid the coronavirus pandemic, which has prompted millions of Americans to request mail-in ballots. Ginsburg's death has unleashed a heated political battle over whether Trump should replace her so close to the election, with early voting already underway in some states.A repeat of the situation in 2000, when the election came down to a few hundred votes in Florida out of 100 million cast nationwide, remains unlikely, experts said. Nevertheless, Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, have assembled sprawling legal teams to prepare for potential post-election court challenges. Trump has spent months asserting without evidence that the election will be "rigged" due to mail-in voting, and Biden has said he believes Trump will inevitably dispute the results.Fueling fear among Democrats, the Supreme Court's conservative bloc has already ruled against them in several voting rights cases this year. In April, a 5-4 decision by the bloc reversed a federal judge's decision to extend the deadline for submitting absentee ballots during Wisconsin's primary election. That ruling drew a scathing dissent from Ginsburg, who warned it would cause "massive disenfranchisement."The court has also rejected emergency bids to expand voting options in Texas and Alabama, while declining to intervene in a Florida case over whether hundreds of thousands of former felons should be allowed to vote before paying fines.ROBERTS 'DOESN'T WANT TO TOUCH THIS'If a post- election case winds up before the Supreme Court and Ginsburg's replacement is not yet in place, Democrats would likely aim to persuade Chief Justice John Roberts, who is seen as the court's swing vote, to rule in their favor."I think just like everybody else in the country, Justice Roberts is really, really hoping the election isn't close," said Sylvia Albert, the director of voting and elections at the good government nonprofit Common Cause. "He does not want to touch this with a 10-foot pole."Roberts sided with the court's liberal minority in several key cases earlier this year and has shown a desire to avoid turning the court into a partisan institution.If he were to join the three remaining liberals, that would create a 4-4 split, which would leave in place any lower court decision but could undermine public confidence in the Supreme Court. Republican Senator Ted Cruz said on Fox News on Friday that Trump needed to replace Ginsburg to forestall the possibility of a deadlocked court and a "constitutional crisis."In 2016, Cruz was among Republican senators who refused to let Democratic President Barack Obama fill a court vacancy in an election year, leaving the court with eight members. Trump's nominee Neil Gorsuch filled that seat the following year. If a dispute around the 2020 election were to reach the Supreme Court and Ginsburg's seat had already been filled by a Trump nominee, a ruling by the conservative majority that ensured Trump's victory would be hard for many Americans to swallow, said Paul Smith, a Georgetown University law professor and vice president at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit voter advocacy group. "It would be terrible for the country if you have at the same time a president who is viewed as illegitimate by a large percentage of the country and a court that is seen as complicit," said Smith.

George L. Ray Reynard


  May 22, 1936 — September 13, 2020


  George Lee Ray Reynard, known to his family and friends as Ray Reynard, passed away on September 13, 2020, of conditions related to age. He was born on May 22, 1936, in Buffalo, Kansas, to George and Juanita (Ayre) Reynard.


  His family moved to Washington state early on, where he was to live most of his life. He graduated from Finley High School in 1954 and joined the Army. He was stationed in Alaska, a state he grew to love. After being honorably discharged he pursued his college education. First stop was Mexico City, where he played baseball. Go Aztecs! After his stint there, he returned home and attended Columbia Basin College and served as Student Body President.


  In 1961, he married Delores (Dowd), the love of his life, spending the rest of his life with her.


  Ray had a full career through his life. He was a go getter, and the common thread in all was building relationships with his customers. From owning a car wash, and auto parts department to a Triple XXX Root Beer restaurant, his crowning glory was owner/operator of Kwik Kill Pest Control, a family-owned business since 1989. Being involved in the community and supporting local businesses was very important to him. Ray was an avid outdoorsman, particularly hunting and fishing. He had many hunting dogs over the years to accompany his pheasant hunting trips. He enjoyed camping and instilled in his children the love of outdoors as well. Countless weekends were spent hunting morels at the family cabin at Tollgate. Ray and Delores enjoyed many trips over the years, both domestic and overseas and he never shied away from a road trip. Numerous family trips to South Dakota, where Delores was from, were made by car; 3 kids and 2 dogs were never a deterrent.


  Ray’s love of animals—particularly dogs--was legendary. It would be nothing to have at least 4 -5 dogs at one time. He is no doubt reunited with countless dogs from days gone by.


  In the last few years as his health declined, being on Facebook and connecting with people became his lifeline to the world. His witticisms, as Ol’ Ray sez were enjoyed by all and will be missed.


  He is survived by his wife of 59 years, Delores; daughter, Jill (Chad) Langis; sons, Corey (Darcie) and Kyle Reynard; half-brother, Larry (Kathy) Ayre, sister-in-law Carol Ayre. His newly found half-sisters in Kansas, Lenora Reynard Brown and Alice Williamson. Two grandchildren, Devon and Kendall Langis; nephews, Chris Ayre, Steven Ayre, Jeffrey Ayre, and Tyler Ayre; and numerous cousins. Preceded in death by Mom, Juanita Ayre; step-dad, Lawrence “Shorty” Ayre; biological dad, George Reynard Jr; half-bother, Michael Ayre.

“I put (the operator) on speaker and I set my phone on the ground,” Birgy said. “I remember from training that you put your hands down on the breastbone right in between the chest, and you go down about two inches. He starts counting out, one-two, one-two, one-two and it speeds up.”


  Soon a man on a motorcycle noticed Birgy making an effort to revive the man, and then joined the effort to help. He was a former medic in the Navy. Birgy asked him to take over, as he said he had more experience in CPR.


  Five to eight minutes after that, the man woke up before first responders arrived.


  “The police officer was walking up on the scene and the guy wakes up and he takes a deep breath and he goes, ‘Where am I?’ ‘What’s going on?’” Birgy said. “Minute or two later, the ambulance got there, and by that time he was talking. He was sitting up and talking.”


  Recalling the story over the phone days after it happened, Birgy still couldn’t believe how the situation transpired.


  “My adrenaline was quite high at that moment,” Birgy said. “I was sitting there wondering to myself, ‘Wow. How? What just happened?” Birgy said. “I couldn’t really get a full thought coming.”


  Birgy said there wasn’t really a thought process in his decision to turn his car around, “it was almost like second nature”


  Kalkaska football coach Jeremy Wilkinson called Birgy a quiet kid, humble and almost naive to the attention the event has garnered.


  Wilkinson said deep down he knows Birgy doesn’t care about it.


  “He’s a quiet kid, he kind of stays to himself a bit until he’s someone you get to know, then he’ll open up a bit,” Wilkinson said.


  “This was something that he wasn’t telling everyone about, he wasn’t bragging to everyone what he did to try and draw attention to himself because it’s not what he wanted.


  “I don’t know if he realizes how huge of a thing was what he did. Once people started hearing about it, it really took off around the community.”


  Justin Harlan, the Blazers quarterback called Birgy a nice kid, knowing him since at least fifth grade. He wasn’t sure if he’d have done the same thing Birgy did if he were in the same situation.


  “Honestly, if I saw a guy laying down, maybe I would,” he said. “If I saw him in a car or pulled over, I don’t know if I would.”

GARETH BALE first made his name a decade ago as a flying left winger who scored goals for fun, but when the Welshman is fit and ready for his second coming at Spurs, he will do well to displace Heung-Min Son, the incumbent left-sided attacker.
 The speedy Korean scored four goals as Tottenham ran riot at Southampton to rack up their first Premier League points and increase the feelgood factor around the club, which announced the double signings of Bale and Sergio Reguilo from Real Madrid on Saturday.
 Neither new player was involved yesterday, but they cannot fail to have been impressed by Son's finishing and the all-round play of Harry Kane, who created all four of the Korean's goals and added one himself in the closing stages.
 Bale has been added to give Spurs more of an attacking threat and authoritative leadership in the dressing room, but Kane and Son have those attributes too, as captains of their respective countries and proven Premier League goalscorers.
 The prospect of Bale joining them in a three-pronged attack should terrify defenders as much as it may excite Tottenham fans and neutrals, although there is still work to be done on the Spurs defence, who were grateful to Hugo Lloris – captain of world champions France, lest we forget – for some excellent saves in an even first-half.
 Southampton had taken a deserved lead through Danny Ings before Son equalised in first-half stoppage time. But once the Korean put Spurs ahead early in the second-half, there was no stopping them. Ings lessened the damage for Saints with a last-minute penalty to make it five goals in five games against Tottenham over the past year, showing why Jose Mourinho is interested in taking the striker to north London to support Kane.
 But when Son is in this sort of form, his partnership with Kane is deadly, and it worked best when the England captain dropped deeper to create chances for Son to run on to, as Mourinho explained.
 “Harry changed the game,” he said. “His movement was tremendous and his link play was absolutely incredible, and he allowed Sonny to play in a different position.”
 Mourinho's master plan was borne out of four meetings with Southampton last season, plus the inside knowledge of Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, who left Saints for Spurs last month. The Dane brings a powerful all-round game to midfield, and allows Tangy Ndombele to play a more creative role.
 The Frenchman looked lively and played a part in Son's equaliser on the stroke of half-time, but was then replaced by Giovanni Lo Celso at the break. Mourinho explained neither player has the fitness to last 90 minutes, and will gradually improve. And he insisted Dele Alli still has a future at Tottenham, despite being left out of the squad for the second time this week, having been hauled off at half-time during last Sunday's defeat by Everton. “I want a balanced squad and Dele can be part of it – he doesn't need to be sacrificed,” said the manager.
 It was not all plain sailing for Spurs, though, and they were frustrated throughout the first 45 minutes were. Kane had the ball in the net twice, only to have goals disallowed because his suppliers were offside. Ings also had an effort ruled out for handball in the build-up, before he opened the scoring in style. Kyle Walker-Peters, the makeweight in Hojbjerg's transfer, chipped a pass forward, Ings got beyond Eric Dier, took one touch to control the ball and another to lash a shot past Lloris into the far corner.
 But Spurs equalised when Kane played in Son, who shot low past Alex McCarthy from an angle on the right. The pair combined again for Son's second, soon after the restart, and then the third, when a clever reverse pass from the England captain set his team-mate free for a one-on-one chance against McCarthy. He did not miss, and it was a similar story in the 73rd minute when Kane, wide on the right, played a superb curling pass into Son's path. The Korean simply controlled it and shot past McCarthy from close range.
 Both players had more chances to score, in what would have been another embarrassment for Southampton, who lost 9-0 at home to Leicester last season. Kane finally got the goal he deserved when he drove the ball home from close range after Erik Lamela's shot was turned on to the far post in the 82nd minute. Ings grabbed a crumb of consolation in the final minute when a Harry Winks clearance struck Doherty's arm, and a penalty was given.
 Ralph Hasenhuttl admitted the result was a “humiliation” after a promising first half. “We stopped putting pressure on the ball and were very naïve. With the quality Spurs have, they could have scored a lot more.”
 Mourinho, meanwhile, is looking forward to getting Bale ready for battle, although he warned it could be next month at the earliest. “Gareth, when fit, is one of the best players in Europe, and a coach always likes to have the best players,” he said.
 He already has two of the best strikers in the league in Kane and Son, so has an embarrassment of riches in attack. If he can sort out his leaky defence, Tottenham could start to challenge for honours once again.

  With job security a real concern for many, buying a business could give you greater stability for the future, depending on the industry and your skill set. Considering all these factors, now may be the perfect time to contemplate buying an existing business, especially with interest rates at an all-time low


  Nearly every industry has experienced significant changes and shifts during the COVID-19 pandemic. With the economic decline, it may seem like right now is a risky time to begin your entrepreneurial journey. However, buying an existing business rather than starting your own from scratch can help mitigate some of those risks.

  A group of Democratic strategists raising money through an effort called “Get Mitch or Die Trying,” which shares donations among Democratic Senate contenders, reported that within hours of Ginsburg’s death they more than doubled what they had previously raised.


  “In tribute to the extraordinary life of Justice Ginsberg, I’m matching donations to this fund up to $10,000 tonight,” tweeted Grey’s Anatomy showrunner Krista Vernoff.


  Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, included a link to the fundraising effort in his tweet: “Don’t pick your favorite candidate or the one you’ve heard of. Give here. I repeat, this money goes directly to the most competitive races, not just the most famous candidates.”

“Composting is an ecological and environmentally sustainable method to manage animal carcasses. Composting livestock mortality is not about disposal. Rather it is about how to utilize a resource. Compost has value as a soil amendment for cropping systems,” said the AgCreate founder.


  The grant will be used to research and develop competency-based educational materials to best prepare farm labor to care for daily livestock mortalities and also be ready to manage carcasses during catastrophes.


  “The USDA award will fund the rapid research and development of training curriculum that will equip our farmers with the tools and knowledge they need to manage high livestock mortality situations safely and effectively,” said area Congressman Rodney Davis, R-Taylorville, who announced the grant on Sept. 14. “Agriculture has been impacted in many ways by this pandemic, and this grant will allow AgCreate in partnership with USDA to be part of addressing this particular issue.”


  AgCreate employees are wasting no time. Video production crews will be in Maryland next week to interview University of Maine Professor Mark Hutchinson, an expert on the subject. That will lead to a learning experience that will be tested among livestock workers in Kentucky and Tennessee next month.


  “They’ll see the training video, complete a virtual simulation of desired end skills, do the task with a mentor, then they’ll have to teach it back to a trained verifier as part of their training,” said Probst Miller, who grew up on a pig farm.


  The grant is funded by the United States Department of Agriculture and National Institute of Food and Agriculture.


  AgCreate Solutions currently employs 10 people.

Mary Jean Nicholls      Seattle, WA      August 28, 1944 ~ July 25, 2020      Mary Jean Nicholls, age 73, passed away peacefully in her home on July 25, with her husband, Jim Nicholls, by her side.      Mary Jean was born and raised in Seattle, being the first of three siblings born to first generation Croatians. Her family heritage in Seattle dated back to the 1920s. She graduated from Lincoln High School, earned her AA degree at North Seattle Community College with honors, and completed her BA degree cum laude at Seattle University.      As a young adult, Mary Jean became an airline stewardess and instantly fell in love with travel. She then shifted her focus to pursue a career in education and development, spending time with the Labor Relations Union at the University of Washington, and worked as a counseling secretary at Shorewood and Shorecrest high schools in the Shoreline School District. Mary Jean advocated for sex education and counseling in schools, highlighted by her formal presentation to the Shoreline school board. She had a deep empathetic quality with profound compassion for others. This remained a theme throughout her life, which ultimately led her advocacy for equality and social justice. Most notably, she was devoted to the NW AIDS Foundation and later became an Aids Walk coordinator and co-chair of the AIDS Awareness committee. It was an incredible honor for her to host the largest and most successful Aids walk in Seattle history. Mary Jean was also active in Seattle's Croatian community as a long-time member to the American Slavic Woman's Club, serving as secretary, board member, and scholarship committee chairperson. Her dedication will be remembered with gratitude.      Mary Jean was most proud of being a mother to her son Jeffrey. She raised Jeffrey with love and compassion. She enjoyed cooking with her son and he loved learning how to make Thanksgiving dinner and all her favorite dishes. Jeffrey is extremely grateful to have been raised by Mary Jean and is incredibly proud to be her son. Mary Jean also held a special relationship with Dominic and Biagio, her two loving nephews. From the moment they we're born, Mary Jean cared for them as if they were her own, showering them with love and kindness, while instilling the importance of family and tradition. Children just loved Mary Jean. She was the second "Teta" (aunt) to the virtually every child in the neighborhood. Everyone knew her special drawer in kitchen and contained her special treats. Watching them mature was a special delight for Mary Jean and she cherished her time visiting with them.      Later in life, Mary Jean continued with her love of travel. She learned about her Croatian ancestry first-hand by taking several trips to the Croatian coast and sailing through the Adriatic Sea. Favorite trips included visits to Montenegro, Albania, and Athens, Greece, and a month long trip driving through France while staying with relatives. Her favorite destination of all was Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, where she traveled her husband every February for over 20 years.      While she had several difficult health challenges, her husband Jim provided continuous loving care and compassion. She always remained upbeat and utterly refused to complain. She handled every difficult health challenge with sheer determination, bravery, and grace. It is with deep gratitude that the family recognizes her on-going support and care from Evergreen Hospice and Dr. Samuel Nadler at the PolyClinic. She was the very heart of our family - a wonderful wife, mother, aunt, friend and neighbor. Mary Jean will live on through all the people she touched, remaining in our hearts and memories forever.      Due to COVID 19 a private family celebration will be held. In lieu of flowers, please donate to your favorite charity.

Jeffrey Christopher BRITTAN, Sr.      Jeffrey Christopher Brittan was born on January 20, 1948, the first son of Al & Billy Brittan, older brother to Marc born 2 years later. The north end of Seattle was always Jeff's home, except when he served in the Navy on the Coral Sea Aircraft Carrier during the Vietnam Nam War earning 2 Bronze Stars.      Upon returning to the area after the Navy, Jeff entered the business started by his Dad of being a manufacturer's representative in the food service industry, which he continued to do until his passing -      50 years of sales, traveling the beautiful Pacific Northwest. Equipment for cooling, freezing, transporting, & disposal of food in hospitals, schools, military bases & restaurants was his life.      Forty-five years ago, Marva Jeanne Williams married Jeff, the man of her dreams. Jeff was an excellent Dad to four children - Jeff Jr, Richelle, Chris, & Jessica. Grandpa to Colton & Kira; Nicole & Kyler; Alicia, James, Jillian & Jenna. Great Grandpa to Penelope & Emery.      The Seahawks were a passion of Jeff's after his dad Al Brittan was one of 150 people to name the team in 1975, an honor Jeff shared with Russell Wilson during a zoom meeting hosted by Alaska Airlines and the Russell Wilson Passing Academy. Jeff was also active in Special Olympics cycling, softball and bowling with his son Chris.      Throughout the years, Yachats, OR became a favorite place to visit, often staying in the home of Jeff's friends in the business, Dan & Stephanie Curtis.      Jeff enjoyed several days of kite flying, building sand castles (watching Jenna stomp on them), walking in the Redwoods & playing on the beach with his youngest grandchildren, always with a camera in hand, taking pictures of what he loved best - family, friends and the beauty around us.      After watching the RNC, with no pain & no good byes, Jeff passed away in Yachats on August 28th just hours after sunset.

All of the linens and towels will be gray to prevent colors from running, as people tend to throw everything together in a cottage washing machine, Lupo said.


  The furniture will provide the pops of color, Lupo said, like the yellow headboards in one guest room that were picked up at a Traverse City thrift store. There is also the lime green front door.


  A screened-in porch runs the entire width of the cottage and is enclosed with hog panel, a welded mesh that is normally used to keep hogs in their pens.


  The hog panel was inexpensive, is sturdy and provides an unobstructed view to the lake, Lupo said.


  The couple met when Lupo was metro editor for the Detroit Free Press and Grover was corporate counsel for the city of Detroit.


  “I was sending him FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) requests and he was turning them down,” Lupo said.


  They’ve been together for 25 years and married for 10.


  Lupo, 62, now works in digital strategy for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and Grover, 56, is vice-president of governmental affairs for Cox Communications.


  The tin house property was once a part of a tract of land purchased in 1939 by Grover’s grandparents, William “Sam” McInally and his wife Steve and three other couples.


  The tract once included land all the way to Good Harbor Bay that was later purchased by the federal government when Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore was established.


  The property was divvied up into six 100-foot lots and each of the four couples built cottages. They planned to use the extra lots to build a central kitchen and lodge, as there was no electricity in those days. But the area was electrified in the 1940s and there was no longer a need for a communal space, and the McInallys bought the two lots.


  In 1973 the green and white-sided trailer was placed on the empty lot.


  “The cottage down the way was overrun with grandkids,” Grover said.


  They called it “the tin house” to distinguish it from their cottage. During one harsh winter snowfall damaged its roof. A peaked shed was erected over the trailer, adding to its ugliness.


  The trailer stayed on the lot until 2000, Grover said.


  The new home was designed by Traverse City architect Suzannah Tobin and built by Heart Homes of Glen Arbor.

You’ll cut down on the usual ramp-up period. Every new business requires time and money to get off the ground. If you choose to buy an existing business, your investment should be more or less turnkey. You’ll save money on employee recruitment, equipment purchases, cost of customer acquisition, and the establishment of goodwill.


  You’ll also save time and money by not having to develop a new concept and create your brand, marketing strategy, logo, website, social media presence, and client list.


  The sales history and track record of the company should all be available for you to study. So, you’ll be able to see how the business did before the onset of the pandemic, plus have hard data to do a cash flow projection.


  And best of all, the previous owner can guide you in the transition. You may even be able to shadow the owner before you take over and learn the ins and outs from the person who launched the business.

  “We have the players we want, we just have to find the right solution. It’s true, it is just the second (league) game. But we have lost six points, and we can’t accept that.


  “Managers are always under pressure. All managers in the world need time. All managers, to get time, need results. And we don’t have the result.

John Eugene Sacco      John E. "Buddy" Sacco passed      away peacefully at home surrounded by his loving family on September 7, 2020 at the age of 91.      John was born at the family home in "Garlic Gulch" on January 19,      1929 with the help of his loving Aunts. He was the second born son of John B. Sacco and Elizabeth Rickenbacker Sacco, preceded by his brother Carl.      He attended Mt. Virgin Grade School and graduated from Franklin High School in 1947. An independent soul, he attempted to sign up as a cabin boy in the Merchant Marine during WW2, but was stopped by his mother before he could get aboard. He served during the Korean War at the Atomic Bomb plant at Hanford, Washington as an anti-aircraft gunner on the Quad 50 machine gun. He lived in a tent for two years in the desert and would never sleep outdoors or in a tent again for the rest of his life.      He met the love of his life Elsie Novito and they were married on April 24, 1954; a marriage that lasted for over 66 years. He held several jobs, but finally settled in at Seattle City Light, at first a cable splicer and then in the street light division retiring in 1990 after 30 years.      A quiet genius, he could make anything and do just about everything he put his mind to. He remodeled the house he and Elsie have lived in for nearly their whole married life, working on it after his work day ended and then on weekends. He had many hobbies; from building his own darkroom for color photography to being an expert airplane model maker. He could look at a picture of an airplane and build it from scratch and fly it, but flying model aircraft only wetted his appetite for flight and he learned how to pilot sailplanes and then small engine airplanes. He was a past member of the Puget Sound Soaring Association. He also belonged to other clubs. A past member of "The Cascade Mountain Men" and present member of "The Sons of Italy" and the "West Seattle Italian Club".      He leaves his loving wife Elsie, son Joseph "Joey", daughters Diana and Mary. Grand children Danielle Sacco Wartena (Eric). Erica Concannon Martin (Brett). Anthony Concannon, Katie Concannon Brenner (Nathan). Nicole Concannon and Sean Concannon. He also leaves 5 great grandchildren with one more on the way.      A private family Mass was held at Holy Rosary Parish West Seattle.      Donations may be made to St. Jude Hospital. Sign John's online Guest Book at www.Legacy.com
