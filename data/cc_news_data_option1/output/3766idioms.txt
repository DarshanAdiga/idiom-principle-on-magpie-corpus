Gen Z and millennials spend a large amount of time on their smartphones. Whether it is for uploading photos on Instagram or Snapchat, or conversing with someone over Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp, smartphones are used more than any other gadget in their daily lives.With the game-changing Samsung Galaxy A51 and Galaxy A71 smartphones, millennials and Gen Z will be introduced to a whole new world. The smartphones come with Super AMOLED displays, quad-camera setups, and a long-lasting battery life. They will perform any task with aplomb.What's even better is that thanks to these smartphones, millennials and Gen Z can now live a stress-free and indulgent Alt Z Life. It's a life where your private moments remain private, and no one, except you, has access to them. Having been introduced to two industry-first privacy innovations - Quick Switch and intelligent Content Suggestions - you'll never want to look back.Privacy first!If you are someone who loves to use his smartphone on a daily basis, then you would also love to protect your privacy at all times. Most of us are familiar with situations where someone was using our phones to take a picture, and ended up seeing something private on them. Also, remember the time when a friend or a family member was checking out your new smartphone, and saw a message that they weren't supposed to see?Indeed, with all our data, personal and private, stored on our smartphones, anxiety rises when someone else is using it. A simple double click of the power key is all one needs to ease that anxiety. This feature, called Quick Switch, is unique to Samsung's Galaxy A51 and Galaxy A71 smartphones. Let take an example from actor Radhika Madan's life to understand it better. In this video, she can be seen planning a surprise birthday bash for her boyfriend (played by Sunny Singh). Radhika, however, isn't prepared for Sunny's sudden visit, and, at no cost, can she let the surprise be ruined. So she simply uses Quick Switch to keep the secret safe! Thanks to Quick Switch, one can now freely hand over their smartphone to another person to click the perfect photo of them. Or even just give it to a friend to watch that video that has gone viral on YouTube. Just double click the power key and the phone's apps - gallery, browser, WhatsApp and more - will go from their private to their public instances.Furthermore, the AI-powered Content Suggestions suggests images that you might want to keep private. The set-up is simple. You just have to select specific faces or images, and the same will be moved to a private folder. Content Suggestions is secured by Samsung Knox, a defence-grade security platform. Your privacy is now secured like never before.You also wouldn't want to miss out on the flagship camera features of the two phones. Let's dig in.Single TakeOn top of the list is Single Take. Single Take helps in those moments when you are unsure of what the perfect frame should be. Just pick up your smartphone, select Single Take and let your subject do the talking.This feature captures up to 10 kinds of photos & videos ( 7 photos and 3 videos). The results of Single Take are immediately available in the gallery. Single Take takes the best shots and moments and gathers them into one album. The camera software automatically takes a short movie, GIF animations, some stylised images and much more, all with the help of AI.This makes it incredibly easy for you to find the best shot and share it on your social media platforms thereafter. With a single click to share, it's also very convenient and seamless.Night HyperlapseNext is Night Hyperlapse. Looking at social media feeds, it's no surprise Gen Z and millennials are taking more photos on a daily basis. Whether they're out dining at a restaurant, or just lounging around in the park, there are times when it calls for a hyperlapse - a moving time-lapse. Thanks to Samsung's Night Hyperlapse feature, one can take beautiful photos even in low-light conditions. That's a win-win.Apart from these there are other flagship camera features such as Custom Filter, Quick Video Recording, Switch Camera While Recording (Currently on Galaxy A51), AI Gallery Zoom and Smart Selfie angle.Get a taste of the Alt Z LifeGone are the days when one would be anxious about handing their smartphones over to someone else. It is now hassle free, thanks to Samsung.The Galaxy A51 and Galaxy A71 smartphones are truly groundbreaking. With a quad-camera setup that is super fun to shoot with and a display with great viewing angles, and on top of that, a battery that lasts over a single day, what more can one ask for?Along with these features, the Galaxy A51 and Galxy A71 smartphones help you live the Alt Z Life.If you aren't already on board, then what are you waiting for?

ORFORDVILLE, Wis.—Much like the school itself, the Parkview Vikings’ athletic department has been shuttered.
 The Vikings’ cross country and volleyball teams were shut down last week when a student from Parkview was diagnosed with COVID-19 and the school transitioned to virtual learning.
 That will again be the case for this week, with the high school planning to reopen on Sept. 28.
 Parkview athletic director Guy Stricker said the decision to shut down sports came at the school level.
 “We did have the choice to continue while the school went to virtual,” Stricker said. “There are schools that are entirely virtual that are competing, so there’s no WIAA guideline against it. But when you go virtual because of a case, you have to do the right thing and be cautious. We don’t want students to acquire the virus through sports, so this was just the safest option.”
 Stricker said he feels for the athletes that have once again had a season interrupted.
 “My heart breaks for the student-athletes,” Stricker said. “And the thing is, I believe we’ve done more than any district to keep kids safe. We’ve had our HVAC system redone to improve the filtration system, we’ve got hand sanitizer in every classroom, but that’s the thing: You just don’t know. At the snap of a finger, through nobody’s fault, you can have a positive test, and when you go through the contact tracing, that’s when you have to make decisions like that.”
 The cross country team has had a pair of meets canceled, including the upcoming meet hosted by Big Foot at the Duck Pond Recretational Facility on Tuesday.
 Stricker said as long as the school is given the all-clear, the runner will start back up on the 28th.
 “I’ve got a very open mind when it comes to cross training because I believe that sport naturally lends itself to social distancing,” Stricker said. “And the boys also have been the two-time defending conference champions, and they’ve got the opportunity to defend that. So even if they only have four meets, but one of them is the conference championship, I think that would be fine for them.”
 The story could be different for the volleyball team.
 “They had just started practice,” Stricker said. “And I don’t think starting right back up with matches would be good for anyone. So then you have to wonder if it’s worth it to play two or three matches this fall, or take advantage of the WIAA’s alternative fall season where they would have the chance to potentially have their full season. I’ll make the decision along with the admin team and the input from the coaches. If our coach asks the players and they want to give it a shot this fall, I’d be open to that. If they want to wait, I’d support that, too. I’m a firm believer in letting the athletes have their say in the matter. It’s their season.”

The airstrikes come as Taliban and government-appointed negotiators are meeting for the first time in Qatar to discuss the future of Afghanistan and an end to decades of war and conflict.
 Villagers said an initial airstrike targeted a house belonging to a Taliban fighter, whose home doubled as a checkpoint for stopping and frisking people to ensure they were not connected to the government. The explosion set fire to a nearby home, trapping a family inside, said Latif Rahmani, who witnessed the airstrikes and spoke to the AP by phone.
 Rahmani said farmers and villagers ran to douse the fire and rescue trapped family members inside when a second airstrike hit, killing many of them.
 Rahmani, who said he was working on his house at the time of the airstrike, warned his neighbors against running toward the burning buildings for fear of a second airstrike.
 “I yelled at people and told them not to go because maybe there would be another bombing, but they ran to help and to put out the fire,” Rahmani said.
