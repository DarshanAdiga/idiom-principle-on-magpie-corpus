Dear Dr. Roach: Are all puzzles created equal in terms of their value in keeping the mind sharp? I enjoy Sudoku and word-finding puzzles, with an occasional crossword puzzle thrown in. I also play games requiring puzzle solving on my computer or handheld device. My partner primarily enjoys crossword puzzles. This has been something I've wondered about for a while, but in this day of health crisis with more people engaging in puzzle solving, I thought I would ask. -- T.M.H.

“It’s one of those things that we just love what North Platte does for our program,” Doughty said. “It was just going to create a lot of excitement and I was really excited to hear they still wanted to do it, because I think now more than ever we all just needed things to look forward to, any signs of going back to normal.”
 There won’t be a competition in 2020, Doughty said, and no date has been set for 2021 yet.
 “Michelle (McCormick) has been working on this since the fall of last year,” Doughty said. “It’s kind of cool how it all worked out. She went to all the former Miss Nebraskas and they each sponsored their own banner.”
 McCormick, whose maiden name was Ebadi, was the 1990 Miss Nebraska. She is involved with the competition as judges chair and coordinates housing for the judges.
 “I think it’s still really cool to have that little piece of history lining our streets,” Doughty said.

“On April 14, I advised council in an open Zoom meeting of an ongoing felony investigation into a former police officer with the City of Mannington,” Stewart said previously about the termination. “I advised them there was video surveillance evidence of the crime. I was then admonished for announcing that in an open meeting.”
 Stewart said Shadrick interfered with the case in which Shadrick’s friend was captured on surveillance video entering a building. Shadrick asked the city magistrate to have the charges dropped on behalf of the city.
 Stewart said Shadrick told him in person and in writing on April 20 that he would be terminating his employment, without the input of City Council. On an April 21 Zoom meeting of the Council, Stewart said he was not allowed to defend himself to council or discuss his employment.
 “The mayor intentionally disallowed me from attending an executive session to defend myself in his allegations against me,” Stewart said. “I was then officially terminated.”
 Monday’s meeting of the council had allowed individuals to be physically present for the proceedings, with attendees asked to sit outside the chambers to provide enough room for social distancing. While the council will continue to host virtual meeting rooms for the time being as well, Shadrick said the city is taking steps to open back up safely.
 “We’re working out the kinks of opening back up,” Shadrick said. “We have been in touch with the county health official Lloyd White, just trying to do it as safely as possible.”

The former leg-spinner said he would love to see "two spinners playing in Australia, two spinners playing in England, which never happens."
 And he said that ground staff could create pitch conditions to favour spinners.
 "In cricket you have the surface you can play around with and bring about a balance between bat and ball," he said.
 "All of us are yearning to start the game and not really worried about saliva or sweat or condition of the ball - we just want to play cricket."
 Indian fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah said earlier this week there should be an alternative to saliva when cricket resumes while fellow paceman Mohammed Shami said sweat is not a viable replacement.
 Australian ball manufacturer Kookaburra is developing a wax applicator to shine the ball, but the world body is reluctant to allow artificial aids.
 Kumble believes that allowing an artificial substance on the ball would kill the creativity of the sport.
 "We've been very strict about substances that have been used on the ball," he said.
 Cricket, like nearly all sport, was halted in March when India and many other nations ordered lockdowns.

Those are two important species that are necessary for a society to function. Same as the salt and pepper that you use daily when you cook the meals for your family. To say the least, Mrs. Good, your naivety is beyond reproach. The same system that you advocate has been tried for 70 years and failed royally. Have you been on this planet in 1989? Have you heard about Gorbachev, Ronald Reagan and the Berlin Wall (which by the way, it worked perfectly for 50 years).
