On the other side, some Texas voters appeared to vote for Trump and then cast their ballots without voting in other races. That trend was especially apparent in South Texas, where Trump performed surprisingly well. According to unofficial returns, Trump became the first Republican to win Zapata County in decades after winning 2,032 votes there, compared with 1,820 for Biden. The drop-off in the next race on the ballot was substantial. Democrat MJ Hegar received 1,816 votes — four fewer than Biden’s losing effort — but the Republican Cornyn only received 1,453. Other counties along or near the border showed similar drop-offs for Republicans beyond Trump.

The Court of Arbitration for Sport has tonight handed down a decision in my case after a long awaited 17months. The CAS have confirmed in emphatic terms that I did not intentionally, knowingly or recklessly use Ligandrol in any manner. There was no evidence produced by my accusers as to how this substance entered my system. With the time out of the sport dating back to July 2019, I will be eligible to return to competitive swimming by July 2021. The anti- doping rules are far from satisfactory and can produce results that are far from fair. In my case, I have proven that I have NOT ever cheated, nor used prohibited substances intentionally or knowingly. I will still incur two years out of the sport in which I love. I cannot change the rules and the rules will remain as they are for the time being. Therefore, I accept this decision with a positive attitude and with gratitude that my career as a swimmer will resume next year. I have never doubted myself for a minute throughout this ordeal and I have never allowed my integrity to be compromised. I walk a little taller tonight with the fact that this ordeal is finally over. I am returning to swimming – the sport that I have loved all my life and the sport that I will cherish just that little bit more ongoing. I want to thank everyone that has been in my corner – my family have been my rock and my partner has been a godsend. My team-mates and supporting public have been a source of strength and I cannot be any more appreciative. I’m going to take some time to reflect and realign my goals and aspirations for the future, now that I finally have a resolution for this case. I look forward to sharing further events in relation to my experience at the appropriate time._

In its second-quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call, management stated that it anticipates a 10-20% decline in open-only comparable store sales in the third quarter. This goes in tandem with the sales trends witnessed since mid-July through August (as of Aug 19). The outlook also reflects the uncertainty surrounding consumer behavior, traffic and demand amid the coronavirus pandemic, including expectations of a sluggish back-to-school selling season.      On the positive side, TJX Companies is benefiting from its e-commerce business, thanks to consumers’ increased preference for online shopping (especially amid the pandemic). The company is undertaking several initiatives to boost online sales and strengthen its e-commerce business. On its last earnings call, management notified that it has reopened more than 4,500 stores worldwide along with each of its online shopping sites. Apart from this, strength in the Home categories has been driving TJX Companies. Incidentally, the company’s HomeGoods and Homesense chains saw robust sales in the last reported quarter. The company stated that it expects market share gains when more customers restart shopping in stores.      That being said, we cannot ignore the impact of high COVID-19 costs, which put pressure on the company’s bottom line in the last reported quarter. Management expects additional COVID-19 net costs of about 250 basis points each in the third and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 — excluding elevated interest expenses. These costs include the ongoing payroll and employee PPE costs amid the pandemic. Apart from this, management envisions incremental freight costs as well as expenses associated with increased third party providers, which will enable TJX Companies’ North American distribution centers process goods. These factors are likely to have had affected the company’s performance in the quarter under review.

 The Hume School in 1978 was designated as a stand-alone local historic district, which means any exterior renovations or expansions will need to go through a community-review process overseen by the Historical Affairs and Landmark Review Board. In 1979, the property was added to both the Virginia Landmarks Register and National Register of Historic Places, but those largely are honorifics and do not come with any additional preservation requirements.
 Located on Arlington Ridge Road overlooking Pentagon City, the Queen Anne- style building was designed by Washington architect Stanley Simmons for what was then known as the Alexandria School Board (Arlington didn’t become “Arlington” until 1920).
 “Prompted by reforms in education and heightened by municipal support for more sophisticated, often monumental structures, local governments gradually replaced the small wooden schoolhouses of the 19th century with commodious and frequently stylish structures, of which the Hume School is a particularly fine example,” notes the Virginia Landmarks Register citation.
 “Its sophisticated detailing and distinctive tower have made it a landmark since it first opened,” the Virginia Department of Historic Resources notes.
 The school was named in honor of civic leader Frank Hume, and continued providing schooling to multiple generations of Arlington students until it was shuttered in 1956. After being deeded to the historical society in 1960, it received an overhaul and was opened in its current capacity as a museum three years later.
 For information on the facility, see the Website at www.arlingtonhistoricalsociety.org.
 The Arlington County government through the years has largely been ambivalent when it comes to embarking on a large-scale (read: pricey) effort to develop a museum or cultural center, although talk of one has percolated now and again for the past three decades.
 In 2014, a task force was set up to consider establishing a cultural center as part of a broader redevelopment of county-government property in the Courthouse area.
 “Ideally, the [center] would tell Arlington’s story through exhibits, research facilities, educational programs and special events. The space should include theater space adaptable for a variety of events and a library bookshop,” then- Arlington Historical Society president John Richardson told the Sun Gazette at the time.
 But the redevelopment proposal never grained traction, and the cultural-center proposal seemed to die with it.

For the short term, the mid term and the long term, the Arlington Historical Society is working to develop plans that will expand its footprint – and that of the area’s past – within the broader community.
 First up will be a planning initiative scoping out efforts to physically rehabilitate the 130-year-old Hume School property, which for decades has served as the Arlington Historical Museum.
 Constructed in 1891 and heavily used as a schoolhouse for nearly seven decades before being handed over to the historical society in 1960 for use as a museum, the building “is in serious need of renovation,” said Frank O’Leary, a former county treasurer who, as a trustee of the Warren G. Stambaugh Foundation, is working to find ways to bring the facility up to modern standards.
 But that is just the start.
 “Even if fully renovated, the museum would not meet the standards of a ‘world- class’ county,” O’Leary said. “All of this presents [the historical society] with the need to not simply renovate a declining structure, but to develop plans for an improved museum that will be a source of pride for all of us.”
 To do so, supporters are pushing to bring together local residents, the business community and government at the state and local levels. To help speed the process, the Stambaugh Foundation has offered to serve as a partner and hold an online event in coming months to get the ball rolling.
 The foundation is devoted largely to issues improving the lives of those with disabilities; its namesake 35 years ago was author of the Virginians with Disabilities Act, a forerunner of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
 The foundation’s goal is to ensure any renovation to the Hume School building (and any future expansion of it) would ensure maximum accessibility to those who visit.
 (The Stambaugh Foundation is named in honor of the late Del. Warren G. Stambaugh. In a connection to the current proposal, Stambaugh in 1985 cosponsored state legislation providing a modest stipend to support maintenance of the museum.)
 A first step would be raising $50,000 to support a feasibility study looking at the condition of the Hume School building, and to provide a blueprint that the Historical Society can use to proceed with any plans it develops.
 The effort has the support of Cathy Bonneville Hix, president of the society.
 “The Arlington Historical Society is fortunate to have the 1891 Hume School – the oldest standing school [in Arlington] – as the site of our artifact-rich museum,” she told the Sun Gazette. “Our current work on the museum is focused on creating the first-rate museum that the Arlington community deserves.”
 In recent years, the society has ramped up efforts to address pressing concerns about the physical condition of the museum, which in normal times is open Fridays through Sundays and for special events (though it largely has been closed since the pandemic hit in the spring, as has the other historical- society property, the Ball-Sellers House in Glencarlyn).
 Any major rehabilitation effort, let alone an expansion, likely would be beyond the current means of the largely volunteer-run society, which each year has a budget of around $100,000 and usually has about $250,000 in assets (both restricted and unrestricted) on hand. It does not receive county-government funding.

A gusher of donations created an eviction legal defense fund, a rental assistance program and other aid to people struggling to pay utility and food bills. In just three months, 800 households received help in forestalling evictions while thousands more received legal and humanitarian services. Despite the community support and a new eviction moratorium set to expire before the new year, housing risks remain without a resumption of emergency government aid.

The German won 72 times with Ferrari, but Hamilton passed that mark on the same day he equalled his titles total and did so in 26 fewer races. He also holds records for most wins, poles, podiums and points finishes.
 Verstappen, hailed as the sport's next mega-star, acknowledged that weight of evidence in a tribute to the Englishman after his own error-strewn weekend confirmed he remains a work in progress.
 On Sunday, however, Hamilton warned that he felt like he "is only just getting started", explaining that the Black Lives Matter movement has given him energy and purpose.
 At 35, as his sport's first and only black champion, he has become the face, voice and conscience of F1 and is using that platform to support the issues that have ushered in promises of change this year.
 "I've been driven not just by my desire to win on the track, but by a desire to help push our sport and our world to become more diverse and inclusive," he said on social media.
 "I promise you I am not going to stop fighting for change. We have a long way to go, but I will continue to push for equality within our sport and within the greater world we live in." His former team-mate at McLaren, the 2009 champion Jenson Button, believes Hamilton will also be fuelled by a sporting desire to carry on winning and breaking records.
 "He wants to win more world championships than anyone else before and I'm sure he would love that," he told Sky sports. "Drivers always say 'we don't look at numbers, we don't compare', but you're always going to compare yourself to Michael Schumacher when you have the same world titles.
 "Those two are extraordinary individuals, very different in their personalities and the way they go racing, but equally as talented. Lewis is in the right place to beat Michael's record and I really think he will next year."

Once again, the team of iFixit tear down into some new iPhones. While the first glimpses of the iPhone 12 Pro Max were shown in a live stream, the iPhone 12 mini makes an appearance in a regular teardown. The detailed teardown of the Pro Max including an assessment of the reparability has to wait a little longer.
 As with the regular iPhone 12, the experts disassembled a European model as well as a variant from the US, as they have different 5G antennas. In the USA, the so-called mmWave is on board, which enables extremely high transmission rates, provided you are standing in the right place.
 ## iPhone 12 mini: honey, I shrunk the iPhone
 Right after opening the mini smartphone, it becomes clear that Apple had to miniaturize various components. These include a smaller Taptic Engine, a shrunken speaker and a battery with reduced capacity. While the battery in the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro offers 10.78 Wh, the iPhone 12 Mini comes with 8.57 Wh. This is still a little more than in the current iPhone SE (2020), in which the battery offers only 6.96 Wh.
 Wireless charging is limited to a maximum of 12 Watts in iPhone 12 mini, while the other iPhone 12 models can be charged up to 15 Watts using MagSafe. However, if you use a Lightning cable, up to 20 Watts are still possible.

The trial begins today for a bus driver who was behind the wheel when his vehicle was involved in a deadly crash. It happened in August 2018 when a tourist bus carrying passengers from Sweden and Finland - members of a karaoke club - crashed through a motorway barrier and fell onto a train line below. Four passengers were killed and nine others seriously injured. The driver, born in 1951, is charged with aggravated road safety, four counts of causing aggravated deaths, and 13 charges of injuring people. The official accident investigation, completed in April 2019, concluded that the driver’s alertness was lowered by his state of health and the long drive he’d had that day. The investigation also found he had little experience of driving the type of bus involved in the accident. The driver also failed to break as he was taking the motorway exit, but the investigation found there were no signs telling vehicles to reduce speeds, and the view of the intersection was hampered by trees.

LCCI President Mian Tariq Misbah said it is really encouraging sign that on the demand of private sector, the FBR officials have designed comparatively simpler and shorter Income Tax Return form that requires lesser time to fill and is easy to be handled by the less-experienced taxpayers.
 He hooped that in the coming years, the documentary requirements of FBR would made more simple, which would certainly encourage more people to become filer.
 He said that according to the government documents, FBR's tax collection in 2019-20 was Rs 3,997 billion, which needs to be improved considerably. The right way for enhancing the tax collection is to expand our tax base by adding up new taxpayers otherwise the regular taxpayers will continue to be over- burdened.
 He hoped that rational tax policies from the government especially designed according to the new economic scenario which has been reshaped due to COVID-19 outbreak. Similarly, the private sector should be facilitated to the maximum extent through giving tax exemptions till the revival of business activities across the country.
 LCCI Senior Vice President Muhammad Nasir Hameed Khan and Vice President Tahir Manzoor Chaudhry said that tax net should be broadened to reduce burden from the existing taxpayers.
 The LCCI office-bearers also urged the FBR to extend the last date for filing of income tax return so that business community can perform their national duty with ease.

Asia-Pacific accounted for the largest share of the market studied, due to the presence of several established vendors of analog ICs, as well as the established electronics industry, in the region. The region has emerged as a major automotive hub, with a maximum market share in terms of vehicle production as well as sales, as China continues to account for a large and growing portion of new car shipments, which drives the analog IC market.   - The region is dominated by computer hardware and smartphones. With growing demand for compact and light-weight electronic devices such as wearables, the analog IC market is bound to show positive numbers in the long run. There has been a significant rise in the usage of fitness wearables especially in the case of the population concerned about the fitness issues and other sportspersons. Therefore, this rising trend of wearable devices is expected to drive the market in this region. Also, IoT devices are dependent on analog devices to collect the data used for the devices operation, so the growth of analog ICs is projected to be robust, over the forecast period in Asia-Pacific.   - NXP Semiconductors N.V. is moving into automotive radar by partnering with Hawkeye Technology Co., that could cement its foothold in the Chinese market, which will help in the development of imaging radar integrating with analog modulated for processing power. The collaboration could open the door for the Dutch chipmaker to play a bigger role in China, where the growth rate of automotive radar is approximately twice that of the rest of the world, owing to which the analog IC market will grow in future.

Ransomware-as-a-Service is a cyber-security term referring to criminal gangs that rent ransomware to other groups, either via a dedicated portal or via threads on hacking forums.
 RaaS portals work by providing a ready-made ransomware code to other gangs. These gangs, often called RaaS clients or affiliates, rent the ransomware code, customize it using options provided by the RaaS, and then deploy in real-world attacks via a method of their choosing.
 These methods vary between RaaS affiliate and can include email spear-phishing attacks, en-masse indisciriminate email spam campaigns, the use of compromised RDP credentials to gain access to corporate networks, or the use of vulnerabilities in networking devices to gain access to internal enterprise networks.
 Payments from these incidents, regardless of how the affiliates managed to infect a victim, go to the RaaS gang, who keeps a small percentage and then forwards the rest to the affiliate.
 RaaS offerings have been around since 2017, and they have been widely adopted as they allow non-technical criminal gangs to spread ransomware without needing to know how to code and deal with advanced cryptography concepts.
