On paper, the Panthers' defensive line is their strongest unit. They finished second in the league in sacks this year (53) and have as many weapons up front as any NFL team. However, several key pieces are about to become free agents and most of them are past their prime. Mario Addison, Bruce Irvin and Gerald McCoy are all over 30 years old and need new contracts if Carolina is going to keep them around. Dontari Poe is also 29 and has a huge cap hit. The Panthers have to find the right balance between youth and experience while building for the future around guys like Brian Burns.

The child was placed in school and assessed as being two years behind.
 However, he did not appear to be malnourished or to have any other medical issues.
 Mr Wolfsen said the child said he had played on an XBox a lot when living with his parents.
 He ate bread and butter with ketchup and played with the toaster in his father's bedroom - and went to bed when he liked.
 When interviewed, the father said multiple bereavements had left him unable to cope, and he went into a drug-induced downward spiral.
 The mother accepted the house was in a poor condition saying she only lived there because she had "nowhere else."
 Both parents, who are not being named because of a court order protecting the boy's identity, pleaded guilty to an offence of child cruelty by neglect.
 Mr Wolfsen said: "He's been doing well in short-term foster care and will be placed into long-term foster care.
 "He has a bright future ahead of him.
 "He's desperate to see his mum and dad and is described as being fiercely loyal to them - and asks about them.
 "They are having supervised contact with him."
 The distressed mother wept in the dock during the hearing.

"He's a great player. He's getting better all the time and it all comes down to confidence.
 "I'm sure that Jurgen [Klopp] has made him a very confident player."
 The Wrexham-born defender is yet to make his Premier League appearance but has featured on the bench in all of Liverpool's past five outings.
 "He's learning from some great players day in, day out so I think it's only a matter of time now before the under-21s and if he's got anything about him, which he has, he'll be thinking, 'I want to get in the Euros'," Rush added.

The trend in the industry is that, with more performance and more functionality for devices, it’s increasing the prices for everyone. For smartphones that continue increasing in prices, including ours, is definitely not out of the realm of impossibility. What we want to take as an approach is making sure that we create the best possible product for all users everywhere and still have what keeps OnePlus unique in our model of business that doesn’t focus so much on traditional marketing or where companies might have traditionally very large expenditures. That makes us more efficient. Those operational model advantages are then able to be passed on as savings to consumers at the end of the day.

Le uscite avverranno a partire dal prossimo 1° marzo e si suddividono in 50 posizioni, che avevano in precedenza già presentato richiesta di esodo, e 250 nuove domande da formulare entro il prossimo 10 febbraio per accedere alla pensione oppure al Fondo esuberi. Ubi Banca procederà poi con un piano che prevede 150 assunzioni, di cui 100 entro il prossimo 30 giugno e 50 entro il 31 dicembre del 2021, con la stabilizzazione di 42 precari, il cui contratto verrà trasformato a tempo indeterminato. «È positivo che ancora una volta sia stato affermato il principio che alle uscite per pensionamento o per accesso al Fondo di solidarietà debba sempre corrispondere la creazione di nuova occupazione - afferma Giuseppe Cassella, segretario responsabile della First Cisl del gruppo Ubi - In questa occasione, tra l’altro, il tasso di sostituzione è di un ingresso ogni due uscite, un miglioramento evidente rispetto ai precedenti accordi, nei quali si prevedeva una assunzione ogni tre esodati/pensionati. Per questo il nostro giudizio è positivo».
