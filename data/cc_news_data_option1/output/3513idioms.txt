BROWN: Initially, I did not want it to be real. Walking in, I knew the news we were probably going to get was not good and that I knew the most likely outcome would end in my career is close to over. I thought the cut was going to be immediate so I am grateful that we have the opportunity for this season if COVID allows. I live in a studio apartment by myself so when I got home from the meeting, it was a mix of emotions. I felt like my parents couldn’t understand what was going on out here and why this decision had to be made. They aren’t able to see all the behind the scenes stuff and how money works in athletics like I have been able to so it was hard to explain something I did not want to talk about but needed to be. I was alone and able to reflect on what my gymnastics career has been, the amazing things I have been able to accomplish, cherish the places that gymnastics has taken me, and be thankful for the opportunities I have been given. I feel really bad for the underclassmen and the freshmen who showed up a week prior to this meeting and were so excited to be Hawkeyes and then to have their excitement shut down with the bad news is definitely a trying time. My team does not have any internationals but every other team that was cut does. Imagine coming from a different country, having just had to go through a ton of hoops to get into the country with Covid-19, and then have this bad news handed to you. It would be a very difficult time mentally. I know I definitely do not have it the worst and have been blessed to have a great support group, both from home and with the friends and connections I have made here at Iowa. I try to remain optimistic about what life will be without it and it may be a blessing in disguise. A school year with no athletic commitments…never heard of it.

 So Cervantes and many others are stuck in a holding pattern. They are spending weekdays at home on their computers, then going out to exercise on their own in the afternoon while trying to stay ready when they are called back to school and given the chance to be with coaches and teammates again.
 Asked what he thinks about when he goes to sleep at night, Cervantes said, “I think about hopefully hearing the good news we get to go back to school and play. That’s the news I wish to hear some day.”

The story takes you to some interesting places and the characters, who at first admittedly looked like knockoffs of the ones seen in the 900-or-so ( maybe not quite as many as 900 - Eds ) Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films, grow into their skins. At the end of the campaign, they seemed almost perfect in their roles — all except for Thor whose bizarre accent is taking a lot of getting used to. The biggest issue with the campaign, however, was the choice of villains with whom the Avengers lock horns. While it was pleasing to see the developers opt against riding the MCU's coattails and going with Thanos as the big bad, the game's adversaries were distinctly underwhelming and largely uninteresting.

Reymond Padilla, director of the Whittier Spartans Softball league, has plans to protect himself, his team and his children from COVID-19 that he follows with zealous devotion.
 The girls — including his 12-year-old daughter — must wear masks while practicing and playing. They take breaks every 30 minutes to sanitize their hands, even though they stand yards apart. Before agreeing to play games with other teams, he asks for a list of COVID-19 protocols they follow. If their rules don’t meet his standards, he cancels the game.
 But that line of resistance fades when it comes to family.
 His daughter lives in her mother’s household, where uncles, nephews and other family are invited for weekend gatherings without wearing masks. Padilla himself made an exception to celebrate the Fourth of July at his sister’s Simi Valley home. The 42-year-old warehouse manager and his sister, a Los Angeles Police Department detective, wore masks. But their children did not.

There was a primal comfort in the sweet scent of kalbi, a mix of caramel apple and steak, a smoky mingling of exactly what we and our parents dreamed of. Some of us smashed our ribs into the rice to smear the grains with meaty sauce; others worked through one tidy pile of food at a time. Nearly everyone knew the best part of the plate was the bones; by the end of the night, kids and adults alike were gnawing off the fatty gristle burned onto the bones’ smooth edges.
 Whether or not we were in the same grades or spoke the same languages, we loved the dish as a community. Every year, old friends and new cooked together in the open air, sharing a meal and the comfort in it. At the end of our annual school cookouts, we packed up boxes of leftovers to enjoy the next day or to give to anyone who couldn’t make it. It wasn’t quite the same as eating it fresh, crowded together at picnic tables, but those boxes still delivered deliciousness.
 We can’t do anything like a cookout at the start of this school year, but we _can_ grill this kalbi and share it with our communities by delivering it to doorsteps or virtually grilling and eating together.

The value of his shooting and perimeter defense as the postseason continues only underscores why the Clippers can’t afford him to be sidelined again, as he was in Game 6 against Dallas after fouling Luka Doncic above the neck, leading to his ejection. In docking Morris $35,000 for that foul, the NBA noted his history of altercations had factored into the amount of the fine. Officials assuredly know his history and could be quick with a technical foul during this series if tempers are raised. But there was no need for that Thursday. Morris stayed on the court and the Clippers were better for it, outscoring Denver by a team-best 24 points during his 26 minutes of play.
 “He was terrific, and that will get lost in his offense, but man, I tell you, defensively in his passing and spacing and being in the right place, he was a pro’s pro tonight,” Rivers said. “Just very efficient. He plays such an intelligent basketball game. It was great to see.”

The three-team race gathered speed. Inglewood’s City Council unanimously approved a ballot initiative to greenlight the stadium and bypass lengthy environmental review less than a week after the Carson plan was announced. AEG scuttled Farmers Field.
 The Carson stadium design was revamped, including the addition of a cauldron where simulated lighting bolts would swirl when the Chargers played and a flame would burn in honor of the late Al Davis for their games. The signature elements were scrubbed from renderings presented to NFL owners four months later and a variety of features, such as a farmers market, were added.
 Behind the scenes, Carson backers questioned the Inglewood stadium’s amount of parking, use of artificial turf, proximity to freeways and how the city would handle the influx of traffic on game days. Though civil in public, the competition played out through a series of presentations to NFL owners and executives, updated renderings, community outreach events and frequent media leaks.
 “As great of a guy as [Chargers owner] Dean [Spanos] is, and as good a partner as he is, they have zero killer instinct,” one person involved in the saga wrote in an email in August 2015.
 The Federal Aviation Administration raised concerns the Inglewood stadium could interfere with the radar directing air traffic at LAX. Kroenke eventually resolved them by paying $29 million to install a secondary radar system. The Chargers and Raiders hired then-Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Robert Iger to oversee their stadium effort. Ridge sent a letter to Jerry Richardson — then owner of the Carolina Panthers and chairman of the NFL’s six-owner Committee on L.A. Opportunities — again raising safety concerns about the Inglewood stadium. Spanos rebuffed Kroenke’s overture to share the stadium.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — The choice of a director of the disputed Pebble Mine project to sit on the Alaska Board of Fisheries has drawn opposition from fishermen and critics of the proposed mine. Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy appointed Abe Williams to a three-year term on the board in April, The Anchorage Daily News reported Wednesday. Alaska legislative committees are holding confirmation hearings on the selection after the process was recessed in the spring because of the coronavirus outbreak. Williams serves as regional affairs director for mine developer Pebble Limited and is a longtime Bristol Bay commercial fisherman from King Salmon, in the region where the mine would be built. The open-pit, precious metals mine would be about 200 miles (322 kilometers) southwest of Anchorage, straddling the salmon-producing headwaters of the Bristol Bay fishery. Dunleavy and Williams have said his background in commercial fishing and leadership roles is an asset. Williams, 49, said his fondness for fishing and his ability to work with people who do not always agree with his views would helpful in protecting fisheries statewide. Critics said a Pebble Mine official cannot be trusted to protect the world’s largest sockeye salmon fishery. The Senate Resources Committee heard from the public and Williams last week, along with the governor’s three other appointees to the seven-member board. The other appointees include University of Alaska Fairbanks professor McKenzie Mitchell, former Dunleavy Senate aide John Wood and John Jensen, a reappointment from Petersburg. Democratic state Rep. Geran Tarr, co-chair of the House Resources Committee, said lawmakers received more than 450 emails, nearly all of them opposed to Williams. Many were form letters submitted after opponents of...

Curtis Stone will open a new restaurant and market at the Grove called Picnic Society by Gwen, inspired by his Hollywood butcher shop. The restaurant, located in the former Dominique Ansel Bakery space, is scheduled to open on Sept. 14.
 The Michelin-starred chef, who also owns Maude in Beverly Hills, says the plan is to operate the restaurant for a four-month residency. It’s the latest in a string of temporary outdoor restaurants that have popped up around Los Angeles as a result of the ongoing pandemic. Most recently, that list includes Evan Funke’s Finger’s Crossed in Hollywood and Vartan Abgaryan’s Post Script in Venice.
 Like many chefs in L.A., Stone transformed his bustling dining rooms into marketplaces and switched to a takeout-only model. Without an opportunity to have outdoor seating at Gwen or Maude, Curtis says, he was contemplating next steps when the Grove owner Rick Caruso reached out.
 “This opportunity came up with a beautifully built-out kitchen and a big patio and terrace area,” Stone said. “I thought what if we lean into a picnic concept that encourages people and gives them the option to social distance?”

The actual cost might be higher.
 “There’s huge, huge risk, still, because you’re doing something at a cost no one has ever done before,” Kroenke said the week before the Rams played in the Super Bowl in February 2019. “We try to take the risk out of it, so we had independent cost estimates all along the way as we developed the stadium. The problem was ... those cost estimates by two independent people who worked with our architects on the costing were way off. They were just way off.
 “So it takes a lot more investment, so that’s more risk. But we’re long term. ... We don’t get involved in things unless we think we’re going to be there for a long time.”
 Stadium-related building permits filed with Inglewood through September 2019 are valued at about $2 billion, though the permits represent only a fraction of the project’s construction costs.
 NFL owners in May approved the Rams borrowing an additional $500 million — believed to be a combination of a private loan to Kroenke and an increased debt limit for the franchise — to help finance the stadium.
 “As costs went up as dramatically as they did, the fact that Stan didn’t cut corners or reduce the scope of the project engendered a tremendous amount of goodwill from owners and league executives,” said Marc Ganis, president and founder of the Chicago-based sports consulting firm SportsCorp. “Very few people in the country could have handled the additional debt without it being a strain. Stan is one of the few.”
