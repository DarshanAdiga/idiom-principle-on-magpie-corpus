WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows were set to discuss a stalled COVID-19 aid package but the outlook for any swift resolution appeared bleak as President Donald Trump’s team and congressional Democrats have been unable to agree on a compromise.Their expected call Thursday afternoon would be the first attempt to kick-start talks since negotiations fell apart earlier this month. The stalemate comes as jobless claims hit 1 million Thursday and households are struggling during the pandemic.Previous unemployment assistance, eviction protections and small business relief are ending yet the virus toll is mounting with almost 180,000 deaths nationwide, more than any other country.“We’re not going to budge,” Pelosi said the Capitol.The California Democrat said she has been waiting for the White House to meet in the middle. Democrats have dropped their $3 trillion proposal to $2 trillion. Before talks collapsed, Democrats suggested Trump’s team could move their $1 trillion proposal toward $2 trillion. But no counter offer came.“Our number is a defensible scientific institutional base justification for what the public needs,” Pelosi said. “They’re just going to have to come up with more money.”Congress is on recess until September and it appears unlikely lawmakers will be recalled to Washington unless there is a deal ready for voting. The talks are nowhere near that level and in fact are broadening to include other needs including Postal Service funds before the November election. There’s also new disaster aid needs expected with the Gulf State hurricanes and California wildfires.Any relief package could become rolled into talks over a must-pass package to keep the government funded after the Sept. 30 budget year deadline.Meadows and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have been briefing Republican senators almost daily, but those familiar with the private conference calls say there has been little new information about any new deal.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., floated a “skinny” proposal last week, trying to move talks toward a more narrow band of priorities that most Democrats and Republicans agree on, including small business help and some type of a jobless benefits boost to replace the $600 weekly boost that expired in July.There is also widespread support for at least $105 billion for education to help schools prepare for fall classes, and McConnell also suggested $10 billion for the Postal Service, which is less than the $25 billion mail rescue Pelosi and Democrats approved Saturday amid widespread postal disruptions.One key sticking point involves sending federal dollars to cash-strapped state and local governments. Democrats initially sought $1 trillion to help cities and states weather the coronavirus crisis, but Trump, McConnell and Republicans refuse to provide what they call “bailouts” for states.McConnell acknowledged Thursday there’s a “stalemate” over a new package.During a visit to a hospital in Pikeville, Kentucky, McConnell said he remained hopeful for a deal, “We need another one, the country needs another one,” he said.Yet McConnell faces his own difficulties because many, if not most GOP senators appear satisfied, for now, that there remains enough existing aid available and new money is not needed right now. The split in his ranks gives Pelosi an upper hand in talks because she has been able to bring most of her Democrats on board with her proposals.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Certain notions regarding nutrition and diet prevail even in the wake of research that suggests they shouldn't. For example, it has long been assumed that females diet and men give little thought to the foods they consume. But many such assumptions no longer hold water.
 Recent evidence shows that men diet, too, and many men — perhaps spurred on by a recent health crisis or a desire to be as healthy as they can be — have taken much more informed and active roles in regard to their diets.
 Data from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases says around 73.7 percent of men in the United States are considered to be overweight or obese. This may be driving the fact that more than one in three U.S. consumers followed a specific diet or eating pattern in 2018, according to the Annual Food and Health Survey, released by the International Food Information Council Foundation. In 2016, a survey of more that 2,000 adults in the United Kingdom, conducted by the retail analysts Mintel, uncovered that almost half of Brits tried to lose weight in the year prior. However, 42 percent of male respondents and 33 percent of female participants reported being unaware of how many calories they were consuming each day.

“Messi's future will have an influence on Suarez's because they are best friends, they get along on and off the pitch,” the lawyer claimed in an interview with  _TyC Sports_. “There is a lot of brotherly love between Messi and Suarez, they are inseparable, always together.”
 While there can be no doubting that Messi and Suarez, whose families have holidayed together several times, are indeed close friends, the latter took to social media on Thursday to distance himself from Balbi's comments.
 “There are people talking about me or on my behalf when I have not had a relationship with them for years,” Suarez said. “When I need to speak, I'll speak for myself.”
 Barcelona fans will want to hear from both Suarez and Messi sooner rather than later, with supporters having already been protesting outside of Camp Nou in the wake of recent developments.
 While official news regarding Suarez's future may take time to appear, Messi himself is expected to address the public in the coming days regarding his decision to leave the club at which he has spent his entire senior career.

Trump gets involved - US President Donald Trump also spoke to Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday -- his first direct involvement in the dispute.
 The White House said Trump "expressed concern over increased tension between NATO allies Greece and Turkey".
 The Greek prime minister said afterwards that Athens was "ready for a significant de-escalation -- but on condition that Turkey immediately stops its provocative actions".
 Erdogan has already rejected any preconditions for talks with Greece.
 His office said Erdogan "reminded (Trump) our country was not the one creating instability in the eastern Mediterranean".
 Erdogan "emphasised how Turkey has taken concrete steps which proves it sides with lowering tensions and dialogue," the presidency said.
 Greece's European support is led by EU military powerhouse France.
 French frigates and fighter jets joined the Greek war games -- also including Italy and Cyprus \-- on Wednesday while Turkey staged smaller ones nearby with a US navy ship.
 The French intervention has particularly upset Turkey.
 "The time for bullying is over. You have no chance of forcing us to take actions through bullying," Akar told France in a televised interview.
 Akar also urged Greece to stop hiding behind France or the EU and said: "As Turkey and the Greeks, we need to solve our problems by holding talks." The EU meanwhile appears divided over how to respond.
 Greece's push to sanction Turkey failed to get off the ground at an EU foreign ministers' video conference on August 14.
 Turkey's position found some support from southern European countries that would be most directly affected should Erdogan retaliate against the bloc.
 EU foreign ministers were expected to make a statement on the standoff on Friday.

Beirut, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 27th Aug, 2020 ) :The UN's culture and education body will organise two conferences to seek "considerable" funding for blast-hit Beirut, its director said Thursday in the Lebanese capital.
 Audrey Azoulay told AFP during a visit to a school damaged in the colossal August 4 explosion at Beirut's port that two events were in the works, including a fundraising event for Beirut's heritage, during which UNESCO would seek hundreds of millions of dollars.
 "The first one will be a meeting of the Global Education Coalition dedicated to Lebanon," she said, referring to a body set up to support remote learning since the Covid-19 pandemic began.
 "The country absolutely needs to be better prepared on this issue of remote learning," she said.
 Azoulay said that meeting would be held on September 1\.
 According to UNESCO, around 160 schools were destroyed or damaged by the blast, which left more than 180 people dead and devastated entire neighbourhoods of Beirut.
 Azoulay said at least 85,000 children were directly affected by the destruction the explosion wreaked.
 With the start of the new school year theoretically only days away, the blast compounded a serious crisis the education system already faced due to Covid-19 and an unprecedented economic crunch.
 Azoulay said a preliminary assessment showed $22 million would be needed just to rebuild damaged schools.
 \- 'Soul of Beirut' - She said a second conference would be organised, probably in late September, to raise funds for Beirut's heritage and the cultural sector.

Walmart has joined Microsoft's bid to acquire the U.S. operations of TikTok, the popular Chinese-owned video app under fire by President Donald Trump.
 That news, along with the resignation Wednesday night of the head of TikTok's U.S. business, has led to speculation that the company's parent, ByteDance, may soon announce that it's entered into formal negotiations to sell operations in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
 Thursday morning, Walmart confirmed that it would work with its longtime technology partner Microsoft on a bid.
 "The way TikTok has integrated e-commerce and advertising capabilities in other markets is a clear benefit to creators and users in those markets," the company said in a statement. "We believe a potential relationship with TikTok US in partnership with Microsoft could add this key functionality and provide Walmart with an important way for us to reach and serve omnichannel customers as well as grow our third-party marketplace and advertising businesses."

 # GIRLS SOCCER | Coventry blanks Alliance 5-0
 Bill Lewis
 Correspondent
 Coventry's Morgan Ross scored time three in a span of 5 minutes, 28 seconds, to lead the Comets to a 5-0 victory over Alliance at the Rockhill Soccer Complex on Wednesday night.
 The victory improved the Comets' record to 1-0-1, while the Aviators fell to 1-1 heading into a Thursday match at Garfield.
 "[Ross] is one of the best scorers that we will face this season," said Alliance coach Matt Horning. "We knew that coming in and tried to prepare for that, but she did a nice job of attacking our defense."
 The teams played even for the first 10 minutes but the complexion of the game changed in an instant when Ross, attacking from the left side, drilled the ball into the Alliance goal in the 10th minute.
 Ross added to Coventry's lead in the 12th minute and added her third goal in the 16th minute.
 Offensive opportunities were at a premium for the young Aviators, who lost the majority of their offensive threats from last season to graduation. Their best chance to get on the board came in the 28th minute when freshman Jayda Patrick hit the crossbar.
 "That was a nice attempt by Jayda. She was a little high hitting the crossbar, but it bounced back in front of the goal. Unfortunately, we didn't have anyone in position to finish it. A goal there might have given us some momentum," said Horning.
 The Comets added to their lead in the 35th minute on Ross's fourth goal when she finished a corner kick.
 Alliance's defense stiffened in the second half, allowing only a goal by Olivia Shockey in the 71st minute to make the final 5-0.
 "I am very proud of these girls, they have worked hard all summer long," said Coventry coach Mallory Farrance. "We had a tough first match, tying Barberton 1-1 and I am proud of the way that we bounced back.
 "I am a former player and alum of Coventry. Now to come back as a teacher and a coach; this is very special to me."
 Horning took some positives out of the setback.
 "The final score is very deceiving in regards to the play of our sophomore keeper La'Kasja Edwards," he said. "This is her second varsity start and she made some good saves on some difficult shots. Coventry is a good offensive team."
 The Comets recorded 13 shots on goal with Edwards saving eight of them. She showed good instincts in the box and came off of her line on several occasions to make a defensive stop.
 The Aviators were only able to muster two shots on goal. Coventry led in corner kicks, 5-0.

Lyrically, Wallen — who was born in tiny Sneedville, Tenn., and broke into music after appearing on “The Voice” in 2014 — vividly evokes his background in lines about “sippin’ on a sixer” by the river and buying “a few acres couple roads off the highway.” Like his haircut, his down-home accent is pure country too, even as he nails the tricky vocal flourishes that give “7 Summers” a quietly soulful tug. Imagine a more tender, rhythmically nimble version of what Luke Combs or Chris Stapleton does.
 “I think in most of my songs, I’m trying to paint a picture of where I’m from,” said Wallen, whose other hits include the similarly plaintive “More Than My Hometown” and the slightly rowdier “Whiskey Glasses.” (After after he was eliminated from “The Voice,” he moved to Nashville and befriended the members of Florida Georgia Line, with whom he parties on a boat in the video for his first top 10 single, “Up Down.”)
 “I’ve been all over the place now, but east Tennessee is still my favorite place in the world,” he said. “So getting to picture my home in my head — it’s a comforting thing.”

Barack Obama is supporting NBA and WNBA players for boycotting games due to the Jacob Blake shooting. The former President of the United States went Twitter to send a message to both leagues for taking a stand against racism. Obama said more things like these have to happen in order to move forward.
 "I commend the players on the Bucks for standing up for what they believe in, coaches like Doc Rivers, and the NBA and WNBA for setting an example," Obama wrote. It's going to take all our institutions to stand up for our values." The NBA and WNBA called off games on Wednesday to show support for Blake, a Black man from Wisconsin who was shot by police while attempting to enter the driver's side of his vehicle. Blake's family said that three of his children were in the car during the shooting. Blake was rushed to the hospital, and the family's attorney said the 29-year old man is paralyzed from the waist down.
 "It's amazing why we keep loving this country, and this country does not love us back," Rivers said when talking about the Blake shooting. "It's really so sad. Like, I should just be a coach. I'm so often reminded of my color. It's just really sad. We got to do better. But we got to demand better." On Wednesday, the Milwaukee Bucks made the decision to boycott their playoff game against the Orlando Magic. It then led to the NBA calling off the three postseason games that were scheduled. As for the WNBA, the games between the Washington Mystics and the Atlanta Dream, the Los Angeles Sparks and Minnesota Lynx, and Connecticut Sun against Phoenix Mercury were also postponed.
 "The NBA and the National Basketball Players Association today announced that in light of the Milwaukee Bucks' decision to not take the floor today for Game 5 against the Orlando Magic, today's three games - Bucks vs. Magic, Houston Rockets vs. Oklahoma City Thunder and Los Angeles Lakers vs. Portland Trail Blazers - have been postponed. Game 5 of each series will be rescheduled," the league said in a statement." There were talks of the NBA calling off the rest of the season to focus on the racial and social issues going on in the country. However, the season will move forward and playoff games will likely resume this weekend.

 Luis Suarez has hit back at comments made by his former lawyer Alejandro Balbi that suggested the Uruguayan's future would be linked to that of Lionel Messi, with both players looking likely to leave Barcelona ahead of the 2020-21 season.
 Messi recently rocked the football world with the revelation that he longer wishes to see out the remainder of his career at Camp Nou, expressing his desire to leave Barca amid one of the most tumultuous periods in the club's history.
 Indeed, there have been widespread calls for club president Josep Maria Bartomeu to step down, with his time in office seen as a disaster both on and off the pitch.
 The appointment of Ronald Koeman, a club legend, was seen as a move to appease players and fans, but the Dutch head coach is reported to have told Suarez to find a new team as he is not part of his long-term plans in Catalunya.
 With the striker being close friends with Messi, a destructive fall-out ensued, with Balbi among those to have weighed in on where both Messi and his former client may end up come next season.

During any given summer, college, high school and middle school cross country runners use that time period to enhance the fitness for the upcoming fall cross country season. Even during the pandemic, student-athletes still put time on roads and trails this summer to try to keep their fitness levels strong for the upcoming season.
 Now about that season, for middle school and high school runners, as of Thursday, Aug. 27 (when I wrote this column), are getting ready for a season per the guidelines set for practices and meets by the West Virginia Secondary Schools Activities Commission. Here’s hoping for a safe season for all of the runners.
 However, that is not the case for the cross country runners at Marshall University, as the plug has been pulled on their season by the university’s athletic administration. While the conference in which Marshall competes, Conference USA, has not yet officially canceled its cross-country season, but even if there is a season this fall, it doesn’t look like Herd runners will be competing.
 Throughout this pandemic, uncertainty has probably been the only for certain thing that everyone can depend on happening. For Marshall’s assistant cross country coach Caleb Bowen, the decision hit him hard.
 “It’s tough seeing all of the hard work everyone did during the summer not be able to be used in competition," Bowen said. "We are going to make the most out of it, we will look at all of the positives and go from there. The sad thing is, if the season would have happened, I felt like we were going to have a very good season. It’s sad, because everyone came in healthy and were ready to go.”
 You have to have discipline to train during the hot summer days, when friends might be having fun in a pool or in an air-conditioned facility.

Now with the decision not to have a fall season, Coach Bowen now must work on keeping his runners motivated. “That is a work in progress right now. While it was a punch in the stomach and was somewhat expected, it was still disappointing. With the pandemic still with us, it’s tough to do anything fun as a big group, just because of the rules and regulations we have to follow. So, we are having to be creative, and I am using input from our seniors on how we move forward as a team.
 "One thing we are going to try is to switch around our training plans, like using a whistle instead of a stopwatch. We just have to keep everyone’s morale up right now,” Bowen said.
 If there has been any positive to come out of this whole pandemic situation, it's that the NCAA has granted all Division I student-athletes another year of eligibility. Coach Bowen made it clear that decision was the only way to go, saying, “It would have been a travesty if the athletes hadn’t gotten that extra year. I mean they lost track and now cross country; it would’ve been horrible if that extra year hadn’t been granted. I’m excited, also, because we are recruiting some great athletes right now, and if we are able to keep some of the ones that are seniors this year back next year, we are going to be pretty darn good, when and if everything with COVID settles down.”
 Every student-athlete has a special bond with his or her coach and right now that connection is extremely important, and Bowen knows what his message to his runners needs to be.
 “You can’t control the unknown, just make sure you are taking care of yourself and friends and we will all get through this, together as a team.”
 Here’s hoping for a normal run for everyone in the very near future.
