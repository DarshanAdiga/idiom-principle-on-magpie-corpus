On a Wednesday afternoon in August, Vice President Mike Pence’s plane touched down in Des Moines, where he was headlining a rally to launch the Farmers and Ranchers for Trump Coalition. Overlooking the airfield was a billboard that suggested that this reliably red constituency has some beef with the administration: “Trump’s Policies Cause Farm Bankruptcies,” it read. The same message greeted Pence on a billboard at the Iowa Fairgrounds where he was to speak.

At its regularly scheduled meeting Tuesday, the Basalt Town Council will hear how the town fared financially during its third quarter, between July 1 and Sept. 30.
 “We’re doing obviously far better than anticipated,” Mayor Bill Kane said in an interview Sunday. “There are three or four sort of layers I think to this phenomenon.”
 Kane credited new online sales tax remittance laws, bolstered retail food sales and the influx of visitors to Basalt over the summer as contributing factors to the town’s economic viability.
 According to sales tax reports from the town’s third financial quarter, a number of local industries performed considerably well.
 “Fly fishing absolutely boomed. Ridiculous. Never seen a year like it,” said Robyn Lawry, Frying Pan Anglers proprietor. “People took up fly fishing and bike riding and everything to do with the outdoors.”
 During the month of July, the town of Basalt collected over $30,000 worth of sales tax revenue on sporting retail purchases, marking a 52% increase when compared to July of 2019.
 “Fly fishing is the perfect social distancing. You can’t get close to someone with a nine-foot fly rod in your hand,” Lawry said.
 In addition to owning Frying Pan Anglers, Lawry also owns the Aspenalt Lodge in Basalt. According to Lawry, since July, the 36-room lodge had been full nearly every weekend — thanks largely to walk-in customers as opposed to guests who booked well in advance.
 “People book up for the Fourth of July and all of that,” Lawry said of years past. “People who did their annual holidays, they pulled out, but it was replaced by impromptu people just wanting to get out of the city.”
 In July, the town’s lodging sector generated 40% less in sales tax revenue than it did during July of 2019; however, the lodging sector’s sales tax remittance leveled off when it collected $23,996 for the town in August — $45 more than the lodging sector remitted in August of 2019.
 As the local lodging industry caught its stride mid-third quarter, retail liquor sales remained strong throughout. In July, sales tax revenue from retail liquor sales were up nearly 39% when compared to July of 2019.
 Gonzo Mirich, who owns and operates Jimbo’s Liquor in Basalt, said business was strong throughout the summer, despite fewer weddings in the area and the hefty alcohol sales that typically accompany them.
 “People in general — at least here in Basalt — I don’t think all of a sudden everyone turned into a raging alcoholic,” Mirich said. “It was just the way things were purchased.”
 According to Mirich, when bars were forced to largely shutter during the pandemic, people turned to liquor stores like Jimbo’s for drinks they’d generally purchase at their usual watering holes.
 To his point, Mirich explained that during the pandemic, premade cocktail sales at Jimbo’s were up considerably.
 “People are really enjoying hanging out at other places with friends without having to do the whole bar scene,” Mirich said. “It might change the trend — if not for good, for a little bit.”
 All in all, things are looking up in the town’s economic scene. According to a town staff report, “revenue for the town overall remains stronger than expected during the COVID-19 pandemic.”
 But despite better-than-expected revenue, members of council have stressed adhering to a “conservative” approach while working on and finalizing the 2021 budget.
 “It’s all about how you spend, where you spend and for whom you spend,” councilor William Infante said. “We want to be prepared to be able to respond in a responsible and appropriate manner.”

Decades of mergers and vertical integration have left producers with little competitive leverage to shop around for chicken feed or choose which company they sell their hogs to. As a result, US farmers receive less than 15 cents of every dollar Americans spend on food, a number that has dropped about 20 percent since the USDA began publishing such statistics in the 1990s. People aren’t eating less—seed companies, agrochemical suppliers, food processors, and other corporations along the supply chain are taking a bigger chunk of the food dollar. And many of those firms are owned by foreign conglomerates, including the largest American pork company, Smithfield Foods (purchased by a Chinese group in 2013), JBS USA (a subsidiary of the world’s largest meatpacker, which is based in São Paulo, Brazil), and Monsanto (now owned by the Swiss chemical giant Bayer). It’s a picture that doesn’t quite jibe with President Trump’s made-in-America ethos.

BROCKTON -- A Weymouth man is the second suspect arrested in connection with a fatal shooting inside a city hotel room last Friday.
 Prosecutors say Valdir Rodrigues, 39, of Weymouth, was arrested at his home on Monday afternoon, just hours after another suspect, D'Vante Bly-Mollenthiel, 22, of Brockton, was held without bail after pleading not guilty during his arraignment.
 Rodrigues, who is charged with murder, is scheduled to face a judge in Brockton District Court on Tuesday.

 The deadly shooting took place inside Room 212 at the Super 8 by Wyndham Brockton on Westgate Drive on Friday evening.
 The victim, 20-year-old Christopher Lascase, of Brockton, was shot once in the chest and died after being taken by ambulance to Good Samaritan Medical Center in the city.
 Prosecutors said Monday during Bly-Mollenthiel's arraignment that he was later identified as the gunman by a police officer who reviewed surveillance video footage from the scene.
 Many other circumstances of the shooting were not revealed in court on Monday and prosecutors hadn't said whether any other suspects were involved. But witnesses told police the night of the shooting that two men fled from the hotel after the shooting.
 This story will be updated.

During the Oct. 26 virtual meeting of the Select Board, Winchester Town Manager Lisa Wong said she would submit a request for $2,014,720 from the CARES Act. The amount is the maximum allowed.
 The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act, is a $2.2 trillion economic stimulus bill passed by Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump on March 27 in response to the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Wong said after compiling numbers from all the departments, the anticipated expenses between now and December, and the expenditures they've already made since March related to the COVID response, the overall figure is just over the $2 million figure she is filing.
 "We're still doing a couple of calculations right now," she said. "We're at just over $2 million, so it actually seems pretty spot on in terms of how much we've expended between March and September."
 She planned to submit the proposal to the state on Oct. 27.
 Transfer Station update
 The town is in the final year of its recycling contract with JRM Hauling and Recycling. The contract ends June 30. According to Wong, for the past four- and-a-half years the town has been fortunate to be paying a low fixed rate, starting at $10 per ton four years ago and ending at $10.52 this year. JRM recently approached the town about providing a blend/extend option for the remainder of 2021 to help their financial situation while keeping the town's costs down for FY22 and FY23.
 "After speaking with some competitors, as well as surrounding communities, we confirmed the going market rate is anywhere between $90 and $125 per ton," Wong said.
 The only item that will rise in November is the fixed rate per ton for single- stream recycling, currently at $10.82 per ton to $50 per ton for November to June 2021. This would require an additional $32,000, which FINCOM approved last week and will be voted on at Fall Town Meeting on Nov. 5.
 Wong said she felt the town would benefit most by securing this rate for FY22 for $45,000 in net savings in FY21.
 Congratulations
 The Board unanimously accepted Wong's permanent full-time promotion of firefighter David Sherwood to fire lieutenant.
 Thanks for the donations
 The Board accepted donations in the amount of $1,000 from Winchester Hospital (Lahey Shared Services) to the Council on Aging for community outreach for the upcoming "An Apple A Day for Fall Health" drive-by event on Nov. 19, and in the amount of $420 for an appreciation of services provided by the Council on Aging. The Board also accepted donations in the amount of $1,200 from the Fire Union Local 1564 and the Tim & Jean Cross Family for the Public Safety Memorial, and another for $404.30 from the Winchester Rotary to assist with PPE funding for the Fire Department.
 Public hearing
 The Board approved the installation request by Eversource of approximately 10 feet of conduit within the public right-of-way. Eversource will repair the town-owned sidewalk. The improvements are necessary to provide underground electrical service to the home at 83 Salisbury St.
 Outdoor dining
 Wong suggested the outdoor dining season be extended through the end of the month, if not longer, to help support local restaurants. "We're doing our best to locate some outdoor heaters and get those to the restaurants," she said. The Board opted to extend the season and to extend outdoor liquor licenses to Dec. 1.

 The Board approved a request from Stephen Hartman, location manager for Mother/Android, to film night exterior scenes on Nov. 5th from 4 p.m.-2 a.m. on Oxford Street between Foxcroft and Calumet roads and interior scenes on Nov. 6 from 4 p.m.-2 a.m. at 49 Oxford St.
