Giselle Williams had never sewn anything before her mask-making endeavors but learned quickly under her husband's expert instruction. His grandmother, Lovetta Corbell, was a seamstress and taught him to sew in the summers he spent with her during his childhood. He showed his wife how to thread the machine, wind a bobbin, and sew a straight stitch.
 "In my wildest dreams, I would have never guessed that the time my grandmother spent with me on her Singer would come back to bear fruit ... responding to a real need," he said.
 Before long, they were supplying friends, family, and frontline workers with masks. Their team efforts inspired other members of their community to get involved. Family, friends and neighbors donated fabric to support the couple's mission.
 Demand for the homemade masks soared in May. To accommodate the flood of requests, the couple upgraded their operation. Darin Williams enhanced the "Red Eye" by adding a motor with a foot pedal and his wife acquired a new Juki sewing machine. Their upgraded process allows them to produce 30 masks a day.
 They have managed to distribute nearly 500 masks across the country and around the globe, from New York to Thailand. The Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) recognized Darin Williams for his contribution to his community and chose him to serve as a spokesman for the VFW Still Serving campaign.
 Giselle Williams believes "it was meant to be" that she could use her great- great-grandmother's machine in this time of need.
 "It means a lot. There's a lot of meaning behind every mask that was made on that machine," she said. "It's been so rewarding, and we want to do more of it."

One important component of any newspaper is its editorial page. This is not only where the newspaper editorial staff gets to sound off on issues, but you, the reader, can as well.
 Editorial Page Editor Richard Coe is a sort of jack of all trades in researching and composing one to two local editorials each day, plus fact- checking letters to the editor and columns written by local readers. He’s also excellent at laying out complicated issues in plain English so that readers and voters can fully understand a topic and take action.
 To gather different perspectives and input, The Bulletin launched an inaugural Community Editorial Board last winter, with five members of our community. We put out a call for volunteers and received some 60 applications.
 The board functioned quite well and brought a diverse set of opinions to our editorial roundtable. The board was meeting regularly until that nasty virus sprung up. Hence, it’s been on hiatus since March.
 It is time for a relaunch and a new set of volunteer board members. We still have the résumés of those who applied last go round, but there may be some new folks in town who want to participate.
 The way to apply is simple. Send us a short letter as to why you would like to be on the board and what perspective you could bring to the meetings. Give us some of your background, too, such as education, places you’ve lived and jobs you’ve held.
 If you applied before and would like to be considered again, please let us know, and we’ll put your name back in the pool.
 We hope to have a new board installed by Sept. 1
 The plan for this board will be to meet via Zoom or Skype . We plan to meet at least twice a month for about an hour. From time to time, we’ll have a guest in — usually a public official — to explain a public issue, such as Bend’s proposed transportation bond, or how schools will function during the pandemic social distancing rules. We also hope board members can bring suggestions for stories or topics we may have missed in our coverage. And, this being an election year, we will be interviewing and endorsing local candidates for the November general elections.
 Keep in mind, all board members’ names are made public on our editorial page as part of our goal to be transparent to our readers.
 While the board has our ear, final decisions about editorials will be made by the editor, the editorial editor and the publisher.
 If this sounds like your cup of tea, we’d appreciate hearing from you. Simply apply by sending us an
 email and some background to
 letters@bendbulletin.com. One may drop off an application at our new offices, 320 SW Upper Terrace Drive , Suite 200, Bend. We hope to select a board by the last week in August.
 And we want to take a moment to thank the previous board members: Rick Allen, Ned Dempsey, Cary Doyle, Lora Norquist and Robert Perry.

LWCF has helped preserve forests, open spaces, watersheds and other landscapes in every state. In western Kentucky, LWCF has invested more than $12 million in Clarks River National Wildlife Refuge, Kentucky’s first national wildlife refuge, which protects one of the largest remaining bottomland hardwood forests in the region. Looking ahead, LWCF funds could be utilized to grow the new Green River National Wildlife Refuge. LWCF has already invested more than $132 million in projects across the commonwealth over the past five decades. Additional funding for LWCF will preserve more natural areas in western Kentucky, ensure their upkeep, and expand public access to continue the strong tradition of outdoor recreation in our state.
 Research on the impact of LWCF shows that every $1 spent generates $4 in economic value from natural resource goods and services alone, and that every $1 million invested in LWCF could support up to 30 jobs.
 The second part of the bill invests $1.9 billion annually for the next five years to help address a massive backlog of unmet maintenance needs at national parks and other public lands. The National Park Service alone reports over 325 million visits each year, bringing opportunities for safe places to exercise, rejuvenate and improve our well-being. And, the economic benefits from those visits support local communities. Visitor spending at stores, hotels, gas stations and restaurants supports nearly 330,000 annual jobs and over $40 billion in total national economic output.
 Even beyond that, this bill will create additional jobs. The National Park Service is responsible for protecting and managing tens of thousands of roads and bridges, trails, historic buildings, employee housing, wastewater and electrical systems, military fortifications, monuments and memorials, and seawalls. Investments to fix these sites could generate nearly 110,000 additional infrastructure-related jobs.
 All told, the Great American Outdoors Act will improve access to nature in places both close to home and worth traveling to when it is safe to do so — all while being a part of the solution for some of our economic, health and societal challenges.
 Enacting the Great American Outdoors Act was the right thing to do for Kentucky and for our country. I hope you’ll join me in thanking Senator McConnell and Congressman Comer for supporting this new landmark conservation law. Enjoy the outdoors.
 David Phemister is the Kentucky state director of The Nature Conservancy.

Deputies and emergency medical workers could not resuscitate her, and she was pronounced dead at a local hospital.
 Friar was treated at Mercy Health-Lourdes Hospital and later released.
 He was wanted on an outstanding failure to pay child support warrant, Carter said, adding Friar also has an “extensive criminal history.”
 Friar faces one count each of murder, operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol or drugs, first-degree fleeing or evading police and speeding more than 25 mph over the limit. Old Mayfield Road was closed well into Saturday afternoon, as deputies reconstructed the crash and crews cleared the road.
 The McCracken County Coroner’s Office, Mercy EMS, Hendron Fire Department and McCracken County Department of Emergency Services assisted.

The flight from Dubai with 190 people on board, including a six-member crew, overshot the tabletop runway on Friday night while landing at the Kozhikode airport in heavy rain, fell into a valley 35 feet below and broke into two, killing 18 people, including both pilots.

"No point in begging," she wrote. "Jolene already stole these two."
 Part of their success, it seems, is that watching them listen to a song for the first time makes viewers remember their own first times with songs. The comments sections of their videos, amid the various recommendations, are filled with tales of fans' own experiences with the artist or the song.
 "I'm a 58 yr old white woman who is reliving her life thru the music you guys are choosing to listen to," says one user, on the twins' reaction video to "Hey There Delilah" by the Plain White T's. "I'm so grateful for the walks down memory lane! Never stop!"
 When asked why they think their videos resonate, Fred is quick to respond.
 "Because we're Black," he says simply. "We're Black, and they don't expect us to listen to that type of music."
 "We're young, too," Tim adds. "It's just rare to see people open these days. People don't open to step outside their comfort zone and just react to music they don't know."
 And yes, they really have never heard of these songs -- even the so-called classic ones many rail about. Their channel is filled with firsts: First time hearing Nina Simone. Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit." Prince's "Purple Rain."
 They grew up in a Black neighborhood, they explain. Rap, they know -- the intro track to their videos is Polo G's "My Story," which many assume is their own song.
 "When I was a kid growing up, all we listened to was rap," Tim said.
 Now, through their channel, both have been introduced to more music. Tim loves Radiohead's "Creep," and Fred likes to listen to Linkin Park's "Lying From You" while working.
 Making videos gives them a chance to open up more, Fred says. And they get to learn a lot while doing it, too, going deep into artist's discographies and learning more about their work.
 At the end of the day, amid a public health pandemic and mass protests, their videos bring joy. They know that, and it's one reason why they continue.
 "For that two, three minutes -- however long the video is -- we just want to just have fun, just together. We just smile, laugh together and everything," Tim said.
 "You could be having a bad day, and watch one of our videos and be uplifted," Fred adds.
 That uplifting, in a year seemingly filled with bad days, is rare -- but at least we have their channel.

Japanese auto major Honda expects sales to bounce back in India over the next few months, on the back of enhanced product portfolio and resumption of operations at dealerships across the country, according to a senior company official. The auto maker, which is present in the country through a wholly-owned subsidiary, also expects production across its two plants in India to touch pre-COVID levels by the end of next month, helping it reduce waiting time for its recently launched products, especially the fifth generation City.
