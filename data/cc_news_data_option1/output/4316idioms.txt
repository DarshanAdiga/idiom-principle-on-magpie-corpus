EASTON -- Leaders from Oliver Ames High School are warning students and families that attending large gatherings in the coming weeks could put in- person learning and sports in jeopardy.
 Principal Wes Paul and Athletic Director Bill Matthews said in a Friday message to community members that it has come to the school's attention that large social gatherings are being planned over the next two weekends that may involve Easton Public School students. It is rumored that adults may be hosting the gatherings, they said.
 "We implore every student and parent to provide leadership within the community to help shut down these gatherings," the letter states. "Think about the serious consequences of holding large parties."

 Parties and large gatherings have become "superspreaders" and the root cause of major COVID-19 cases, they wrote, citing state statistics.
 As a result, some communities have switched to fully remote learning and canceled sporting events, which could happen in Easton, the letter states.
 Students should exercise judgment and social responsibility modeled in school, and avoid participating in large gatherings, Paul and Matthews wrote.
 "(It's) a worthwhile sacrifice to give us the best chance possible to continue in-person school & sports," Matthews wrote Saturday on Twitter.
 Paul was not immediately available for comment Saturday.
 Superintendent Lisha Cabral declined to comment further, saying that Paul's message did a good job at communicating safety.
 Between Oct. 15 and 21, one Easton Public Schools student has tested positive for COVID-19, according to recent data from the state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.
 Most other area school districts did not report cases among students during the same period, except for Southeastern Regional, which is located in Easton. One student and staff member there tested positive for the coronavirus during that period.
 Brockton and West Bridgewater each reported one case among district staff.
 There have been 372 positive COVID-19 cases in Easton, making the town a "green" community at low risk for the virus, according data from the state Department of Public Health.
 Neighboring communities like Brockton, Raynham and West Bridgewater are "red" communities at high risk for COVID-19 while Bridgewater and Mansfield are "yellow" towns at moderate risk, according to state data. Stoughton is currently "green," at low risk for COVID-19, like Easton.
 The Easton Board of Health has released tips for community members to celebrate a safe Halloween.
 Consistent with guidance from the CDC, the board recommends outdoor activities like looking at decorations, virtual celebrations or staying home to celebrate.
 Grab-and-go candy for trick-or-treating is recommended as a safer alternative. When outdoors, people should wear face covers -- costume masks don't count -- and bring hand sanitizer.
 The board says people should avoid any gatherings that exceed state gatherings limits. Crowded indoor haunted houses with screaming and costumes parties or hay and tractor rides with non-household members are not recommended.

Not that everybody wants to listen, which is getting at your question really. This question, how are you feeling? It can be a loaded question, right? Because there's assumptions made, right? That A, the person asking really cares. B, that the person who is being asked is self-aware and C, that the person who asked the question is willing to listen, right? And support what they hear.

So for example, the intrusive thought about stepping in front of a train, someone might have that thought and they're not suicidal at all and most people would [have the thought and think], "Well, that's a bit strange. Here's the train. I'll get on it and go to work." Some people, they might think, "Well, maybe I am suicidal, or maybe I do want to jump." And so what they do is, when the train comes, they just take a step back, they change their behavior because of the thought, and that's the slippery slope because very soon, rather than take one step back you'll take two steps back.

In business services the equivalent increase was more modest, from 1.2 to 1.6.

After a slow start, the Buccaneers' offense has scored 83 points over the past two games. Through seven games, Brady has thrown 18 touchdowns against just four interceptions. In Sunday's win over the Raiders, Tampa Bay amassed 454 total yards and 29 first downs while going 7 of 12 on third down and 5 of 6 in the red zone. Along with his talented receiving corps, Tampa Bay's offense also includes tight end Rob Gronkowski (who caught five passes for 62 yards and a touchdown on Sunday) and running backs Leonard Fournette and Ronald Jones, who on Sunday combined to rush for 84 yards and a touchdown.

A personal anecdote can both lighten the mood and illustrate your perspective more effectively, helping your audience feel less skeptical and more open to your ideas. For example, when speaking to my leadership clients, I’ll often bring up the six months I spent traveling with a circus. While this might seem completely unrelated to the business context at hand, stories about my time hanging out with the human cannonball always get a laugh, and more importantly, my experience handling a strange new situation, building relationships, learning a new culture, failing often, and ultimately integrating successfully into a totally new world often turns out to be extremely relevant to my clients.

THESSALONIKI, Greece (AP) — A man described by Greek police as most likely a migrant trafficker has been killed while trying to avoid a police checkpoint in the north of the country. Police said the man was stopped on a country road some distance from the Greek-Turkish border, sped away at a high speed when he spotted the checkpoint and crashed into a tree. He was pronounced dead at a hospital. Another man was arrested after he also tried to evade the checkpoint and drove into a flock of sheep, killing six sheep and a sheepdog. The separate incidents occurred Saturday, but police announced them Sunday.

“We are living in self-reinforcing echo chambers,” says Gregory, where we often imagine that others see the world precisely as we do. As a result, many of us make incorrect assumptions about others’ political leanings. The risk is that we end up alienating people because they hold a different view. You need to nurture open-mindedness and urge your team not to jump to conclusions. Remind colleagues that working side-by-side with someone who sees things differently can often be a boon to personal growth. “When we start to disengage with people — when we say, ‘I choose not to have relationships with people who believe X’ — we forego the opportunity to learn about how other people think and to influence them,” says Gregory.
