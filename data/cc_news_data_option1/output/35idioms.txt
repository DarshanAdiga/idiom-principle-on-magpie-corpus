Five years ago, through the support of New Balance Foundation, SquashBusters expanded its program from Boston to Lawrence. This new state-of-the-art facility will enable the organization to serve additional youth in a more impactful way.
 “The SquashBusters commitment represents the heart and soul of the foundation’s work in that they are a dedicated sports youth development program that challenges and nurtures urban youth – as students, athletes and citizens – and enables them to recognize and fulfill their greatest potential in life,” says Molly Santry, senior manager, global philanthropy for New Balance Foundation.
 “New Balance Foundation is a generous, accessible, committed and caring supporter,” says Greg Zaff, SquashBusters founder and CEO. “The foundation’s recent investment in our dream to build SQB Lawrence a home is the largest gift SQB has received since its launch 24 years ago. To call it transformative is an understatement. New Balance Foundation has ensured, for at least the next 100 years, that thousands of Lawrence kids will have SQB in their lives. That will translate into a multi-generational promise of health, hope and college opportunity for an untold number of Lawrence young people, their families and the larger community.”
 The Foundation currently grants to many respected and dedicated national and local non-profit organizations including Boston Children's Hospital, Good Sports, Harlem Lacrosse, Rising New York Road Runners, local Boys & Girls Clubs, among others.

Critics of Colorado's red flag law, including gun rights activists and some county sheriffs, rightly worry that judges will err on the side of issuing ERPOs, since the risk of suicide or homicide will loom large compared to the risk of unjustly but temporarily taking away someone's constitutional rights. "We want sensible people to have firearms," one activist told Colorado Public Radio at a rally last month. "We're not looking for people who are mentally incapacitated or whatnot. But when you talk about the red flag law, you're talking about taking away people's due process. Basically you're guilty until proven innocent."

Equally so it has been the resilient political nature of man, who in the face of constant odds has not only endured, but has consistently struggled to challenge the forces of adversity — of brutal despots; of the powerful and merciless medieval monarchs, bloodthirsty state adventurers and democratic fraudsters of our 20 th century.

Iran's Fars News agency has published photographs of him with the troops, and militia sources in Iraq have told BBC Persian he has been there for some time helping the Iraqis prepare for the mission.
 It is not the first time Gen Soleimani has faced the jihadists.
 In neighbouring Syria he is widely credited with delivering the strategy that has helped President Bashar al-Assad turn the tide against rebel forces and recapture key cities and towns.
 Iran has always denied deploying boots on the ground in Syria and Iraq, but every now and then holds public funerals for security forces and "military advisers" who were killed in these two countries.
 Qasem Soleimani has made a point of attending some of these ceremonies.
 ## Behind the scenes
 Iran and the United States may be arch-enemies on the ideological front, but the IS offensive in Iraq has led to indirect co-operation between the two.
 It's a path Gen Soleimani has trodden before.
 In 2001, Iran provided military intelligence to the US to support its invasion to overthrow the Taliban in Afghanistan, and in 2007 Washington and Tehran sent representatives to Baghdad for face-to-face talks over the deteriorating security situation there.

Homeowners are putting their own aesthetic twist on the all-white kitchen trend _ adding warmth with wood-finished or colorful painted islands, for example, according to Renae Keller, head of the eponymous interior design firm . They're also rethinking how to configure their space to better accommodate how they live. Several of Keller's clients, even those who don't necessarily have huge homes, she said, have dedicated space for a "secondary" kitchen _ a small annex that might contain a microwave and beverage fridge so kids can grab a quick snack without cluttering up the main kitchen.
 "Since the kitchen is such a hub where people want to be _ especially kids because that's all they want to do is eat _ it's sometimes a desire from clients who say, 'I just hate the mess all the time,'" Keller said.
 The trend in new construction or remodeling is to get rid of formal dining and living rooms, as modern homeowners don't want to devote square footage and furnishing funds to rooms they'll use only when company comes over, LaMendola noted. So for clients who aren't starting from scratch or tearing things down to the studs, she likes to find out what type of space they wish they had and then "reassign" the function of another, infrequently used room.
 For example, she helped one family turn their formal living room into a media room by swapping out its stiff-feeling sofa and side chairs for a huge, comfortable sectional better suited to watching movies or playing video games. (The shift created space _ and quiet _ in the family room for reading, chatting and other analog leisure activities.)
 LaMendola has also encouraged clients to turn dining rooms that they use only a few times a year into a kids' study space.
 "Put bookshelves in there, and let kids use the table for homework; that's a great way to repurpose the space and give a really nice ambience to a room you'd otherwise just walk by all the time," she said.
 Olson has helped clients transform their mudrooms into what she calls a "family entrance," to make the typically utilitarian space feel more welcoming. Several have opened up these spaces a bit more and personalized them with expressive tile and wallcovering so that they experience as graceful a reception as visitors receive at the front entry.
 "We can choose to treat ourselves the same way," she said, "to have that wonderful experience when you walk into your own home."

CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (WRAL/CNN) - NASA had its first blood clot case in space. There was no protocol, so they contacted a University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill doctor for his expertise."So I picked up the phone and NASA was on the phone and said it was urgent,” said Dr. Stephan Moll.As a kid, Moll wanted to be an astronaut, so he was a little moon-eyed."It was surprising. It was an honor. I was curious to see where that would lead,” he said.It would lead to the International Space Station, where an astronaut had a blood clot.Moll is a star when it comes to his blood clot expertise, having been published in medical journals.For privacy reasons, the astronaut was not identified, but the clot was found in the jugular vein.This was the first blood clot case in space, and NASA had no protocol.“All the decisions that had to be made were best guesses,” said Moll.The doctor couldn’t help but ask if NASA would send him to the station to examine the patient himself.“So I should really be taken up there,” he said, fishing for an invite. “And their response was, we’ll see what we can do and we’ll get back to you.”Moll remained earthbound while consulting a team of NASA doctors. If the clot weren't treated, it could spread to the lungs or brain and become far more serious.The typical treatment on earth is blood thinners, but how would they work in zero gravity?“I needed to weigh the risk-benefit of starting a blood thinner or not using a blood thinner,” Moll said.He and the team agreed to put the astronaut on blood thinners with Moll directing the dosage. The space station had only a limited supply, but the treatment worked.Moll even had a phone call from his patient."My wife picked up and it was the International Space Station, and she handed the phone to me and saying there is someone from outer space who wants to talk to you,” said Dr. Moll.It was enough to make a well-grounded doctor feel on top of the world.The astronaut is now back here on Earth and is doing well.Copyright 2020 WRAL via CNN.

Back then former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki was battling spiralling sectarian violence.
 In an interview for a BBC Persian documentary two years ago, former US ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker recalled the crucial behind-the-scenes role played by Gen Soleimani in the Baghdad talks.
 "[Iran's ambassador to Iraq] called repeatedly for breaks," he said.
 "I couldn't quite figure out why, and then later discovered that whenever I said something that he didn't have covered in his points, he would need to call back to Tehran for guidance - he was that tightly controlled. On the other end of the phone was Qasem Soleimani."
 Mr Crocker also felt Gen Soleimani's influence when he served as US ambassador to Afghanistan.
 "My Iranian interlocutors on Afghanistan made clear that while they kept the foreign ministry informed, ultimately it was Gen Soleimani that would make the decisions," he told the BBC.
 Over the last few years, Gen Soleimani's role in Iran's foreign affairs has become more public.
 He is no longer the hidden figure at the end of the phone line.
 These days he is the proud face of Iran, the go-to man when a crisis happens.
 ## Barbed criticism
 Last month at the prestigious Fajr Film Festival in Tehran one of the winners dedicated his award to Gen Soleimani.
 It was even announced that he would be one of the supervisors in the production of a new film Iran is making about his old adversary Saddam Hussein.
 But not everyone is happy about the general's meteoric rise.
 In December 2014 at the Manama Dialogue security summit, there was a sharp exchange of views between Canadian and Iranian participants over the role of Gen Soleimani.
 Canada's then-foreign minister, John Baird, branded him an "agent of terror in the region disguised as a hero" fighting IS.
 Iran's former nuclear negotiator Hassan Mousavian rose to the defence, accusing the minister of "spending time in palaces and luxury hotels while General Soleimani has risked his life to fight against IS terrorists".
 Inside Iran a campaign has started among conservative bloggers for Gen Soleimani to go into politics. They have dubbed him Iran's most honest and least corrupt politician and are calling for him to put his uniform aside and stand for president in 2017.
 Even the first deputy speaker of the Iranian Parliament has lent his support.
 "His political analysis is no less than the Iranian Supreme Leader or Hassan Nasrallah, head of the Lebanese Hezbollah," said Mohammad-Reza Bahonar three months ago.
 But not all Iranians share the enthusiasm.
 Some political activists are deeply worried at the prospect of the Revolutionary Guards taking control of the presidential palace.
 They point to Egypt where the military have reasserted control, warning that the general now fighting Islamic State could turn out to be the "al-Sisi" of Iran.

Another quarterback player who will dominate the NFL finals next year is Patrick Mahomes. Because of his excellent offense skills in the red zone, Mahomes made his team victorious in the AFC West Division. That’s why they are heading to the 2020 NFL finals next year. Patrick Mahomes also won a series of recognitions, including the two-time Pro Bowl award in 2018 and 2019. He was also the NFL Most Valuable Player in 2018.

Not everything comes to me via email, but since I know I'm emptying my inbox on a regular basis, I funnel whatever incoming bits I can there. For example, my GrandCentral voicemail comes in via email. Any to-do that is due in the future, and I don't have to think about until then, goes on my Google Calendar with an email reminder. When it's due? I get an email saying "Hey, put this on the to-do list." If I'm out and about and have an idea, I send an email to myself from my cell phone, and know that I'll do something with it next time I process the old inbox.

There are many ways to deal without these types of thoughts. For starters, work on locating the source of the thinking error, then look for evidence that contradicts the thought. For instance, you may think in black-or-white ways when your friend doesn't answer your phone call and say that they're "acting funny" just because they didn't answer. Although that may be true, it's still a black-or-white style of thinking because it doesn't consider the reasons as to why they didn't answer. Maybe they were sleeping, or at work, or otherwise unavailable at the moment, but you just went against the grain and assumed they were intentionally shady, without considering the potential grey area of the situation. Thinking errors always contain a _negative bias_ , as it's much easier to think in negative ways than it is to really dig deep and analyze the situation and find more realistic, alternative explanations for the negative thoughts.

I have been a registered Republican since 1976 and I am deeply disturbed that 30% of the voters and 95% of the Republican senators have already made up their mind that Trump is not guilty of the charges brought up thru the articles of impeachment.
   
 Our political system has become a sporting event with both teams doing everything they can to win at all cost, even if it means bending the truth. This is not a game; this is our country and the democracy as we know it is at stake.
   
 In the Nixon era members of his own party voted against him when the facts were presented because it's the facts that matter. When Clinton was impeached the same thing happened.
   
 Let's review the facts in regard to some of the president's most common claims. "The Democrats have been investigating me for 3 years." That is a true statement but the fact is his actions and behavior from even before he was elected have caused that.
   
 "The Russian hoax." Well when the Muller investigation was done six people all very close to the president ended up in jail. They probably don't think it was a hoax. The report did not exonerate Trump.
   
 "The impeachment investigation was unfair." The president said from the very beginning that he was not going to participate; you can't have it both ways. If you don't participate it will be unfair because you are not presenting your side of the story.
   
 As for the two articles of impeachment, the first charge of abuse of power will be difficult to prove in the Senate trial unless more evidence is brought forward. But the second charge of obstruction of Congress seems like a slam dunk to me. The House sent out subpoenas and request for documents and the president instructed people not to comply.
   
 As for the Bidens, I believe they probably are corrupt and should be investigated but the Department of Justice should be the one to investigate, not foreign countries.
   
 As I said in the beginning this is a very important time in our history and the facts are the most important thing to consider.

As Hughes punched the air repeatedly in delight at the final whistle, there was only despair for Spurs counterpart Harry Redknapp as he watched his side struggle in vain to find the inspiration that earned them a place in the top four for so long this season.
 ## Sliding Spurs
           * Tottenham have won only one of their last nine Premier League games
 Spurs enjoyed plenty of possession but failed to exert concerted pressure as a decline that coincided with Redknapp being touted as potential successor to England coach Fabio Capello extended their recent run to one league win in their last nine games.
 They were without Emmanuel Adebayor, who had a hamstring injury, while Redknapp also decided to drop Aaron Lennon to the bench and hand attacking responsibilities to Jermain Defoe.
 QPR had proved their threat with those recent home victories over Liverpool and Arsenal - and the game plan was clear as they ensured Spurs were denied time and space to get the creators Luka Modric and Gareth Bale on the ball.
