 “The best way to respect your opponent is to go out and play hard and play in their face and respect them that way,” winger Taylor Hall said. “It’s not sit back on your heels. ... The best way to show respect is to go out there and play in their face, play on your toes and see what happens.”
 The Montreal Canadiens played on their toes against the Eastern Conference top-seeded Philadelphia Flyers in Game 1 and came away with confidence despite a 2-1 loss.
 “I really think they really benefited from playing a series before,” Flyers defenseman Shayne Gostisbehere said. “They got that taste of the real playoff hockey, and definitely give them credit: they were relentless out there.”

The memorandum says Hill was greeted by a woman who identified herself as Jessica Smith, director of HACHR, who proceeded to give Hill a tour of HACHR facilities and an explanation of the program's various services. The description of the interaction says at, "about 4:30 p.m., Hill and Smith were standing near the bathroom. Hill noticed a handwritten sign on the bathroom door that stated, "ask staff to use, 12-minute time limit." He then heard the bathroom door unlock and open and witnessed a male subject exit … . He noticed the male appeared very sluggish in his body movements and his pupils appeared very constricted. Hill noticed a long piece of toilet paper hanging out the back pocket of his pants.

The 2020 Runway for a Cure Fashion Show will be virtual this year, organizers of the event announced.
 The annual fashion show, hosted by Cuero Regional Hospital, will be a virtual event on Oct. 20 starting at 7 p.m., according to a news release from the hospital.
 Fashion from area boutiques will be modeled by breast cancer survivors and community supporters and leaders.
 “Given the terrific response from the community to this event in the past, we didn’t want to let COVID-19 prevent us from growing awareness on the importance of early detection and to show support for those in the fight,” said Lynn Falcone, the CEO of Cuero Health. “That is why we choose to make this a virtual event and broadcast it from our Facebook page,” Falcon said
 There is no cost to view the show, but there are opportunities to donate or sponsor on the hospital’s Eventbrite.com page. Proceeds from this event go straight back to the community in the form of providing mammograms to the underinsured with the facility’s new 3D mammography.
 “We do not want cost to be a barrier when it comes to this life-saving early detection,” she said.
 Sponsorships as well as donation opportunities are available on Eventbrite.com. A donation of $70 will cover the cost of an entire mammogram. To purchase, go to Eventbrite.com and search for Runway for a Cure, or else call 361-89405112 or email emwaetherly@cuerohospital.org. The money raised last year was able to provide 35 mammograms. This year, organizers hope to raise enough money to provide 50 of the screenings.
 Judy Krupala, the hospital’s chief nursing officer and a breast cancer survivor, will serve as emcee.
 “Early detection was key for me, offering many treatment options, so I plan to share that message with those viewing the professionally filmed and produced show, Krupala said in a statement.
 Throughout October, the hospital will offer 3D mammograms for $65, and a physician order is not required to scheduled. Call 361-275-0170 to schedule your appointment today or for any questions.

Also on Beasley's suggested requests were money to pay for an alignment study for the extension of Powerline Road; funding for the design, right-of-way and construction of a new drainage system that would drain storm water from an Auburndale watershed into Lake Jessie in Winter Haven.


  Also making the county's wish list from the state Department of Transportation is additional money to help pay for the massive widening of County Road 557. The state has committed to pick up the tab for the Interstate 4 interchange, but that still leaves the county with the $80 million tab to widen the road from its present state of two lanes to four lanes.


  The county maintains that since 557 will act as a reliever to heavily- traveled U.S. 27, it should be at least partially paid for by the state.


  Another northeast county project the county wants help with is the construction of Northridge Trail, a two-lane reliever road to run parallel to U.S.27, north of Interstate 4. No cost estimates were available last week.


  The last two items on the county's wish list are for funding to widen and realign a section of Thompson Nursery Road and money to restore and rebuild Homeland Heritage Park. Beasley did not elaborate on what needs to be done at the Fort Meade area park or how much it was expected to cost.


  The county manager's suggestions were “only a draft” and the board is expected to discuss them further at a later session, but no specifics on when that would occur were provided. He did say, “We can work on this until September.”


  While it wasn't on Beasley's list, he further suggested that the commission keep the PRWC in mind when speaking with legislators.


  “We need to get on the funding bandwagon to get the water cooperative projects moving,” he said.


  Traditionally, the commission formalizes it's legislative priorities and presents them to the Polk legislative delegation at a formal meeting, but the lobbying experts suggested they start lobbying now, since the effects on the process by the pandemic were not fully recognized.

Since I am no longer owner of the papers in which my column is published, I generally steer clear of anything resembling a political endorsement. That decision properly rests with the publisher (or editor, depending on the organizational hierarchy).
 But I will willingly stick my neck out to say that Adam Putnam was my enthusiastic choice for governor, and the performance of the candidate who defeated him has only convinced me that my choice was the better one.
 Until a few weeks before the election, Adam appeared to be a sure thing for election as governor.
 He was elected to the Florida Legislature for a term that began only shortly after he reached the legal age to serve, and later was elected to Congress, where he worked his way up to the third-ranking Republican position in the House of Representatives.
 He chose to give up his ever-growing position of influence in Congress because one of his major responsibilities was to attack positions of the Democratic Party. Adam preferred to build consensus. I like that.
 After serving two terms as Florida’s Commissioner of Agriculture, Adam seemed a sure thing to be Florida’s next governor.

ALBANY — Come Nov. 1, everyone in a motor vehicle — front seat or back — will be required to wear a seat belt.
 Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a law Tuesday that mandates passengers sitting in the back seat or seats of a vehicle to wear a seat belt. That includes passengers of ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft.
 Previously, only passengers 16 or younger were required to wear seat belts in rear seats.
 “As an advocate for traffic safety, AAA supports the new law requiring rear seat belt use in New York,” said Elizabeth Carey, director of public relations at AAA Western and Central New York. “While critics may claim that we don’t need another traffic law, research shows that states with rear seat belt requirements consistently have higher overall seat belt usage rates and seat belts are proven to save lives.”
 “We’ve known for decades that seat belts save lives and with this measure we are further strengthening our laws and helping to prevent needless tragedies,” Cuomo said.
 According to the Fatality Analysis Reporting System, people in the 16-24 age group are least likely to buckle up and most likely to die compared to any other age group in New York state.

When discussing plant or lawn problems with some people, I often ask how often they feed that plant or lawn. Once in a while, the answer is, “I water every other day” or “I sometimes only water when the soil gets dry.”
 Some folks believe that all a plant needs is an occasional drink of water and some dirt. In some cases that is true, but in most other cases plants require nutrients to grow strong healthy roots, leaves, fruits, nuts or flowers.
 Vegetable plants grown in soils depleted of nutrients would only grow vegetables depleted in nutrients. How nutritious would that crop be for human consumption?
 All living things need nutrition to live and to thrive.
 Healthy soils, that nature had provided us with, have been over plowed and had many tons of synthetic chemicals added to it over many, many years.
 Beneficial nutrients continue to be leached out of many of our soils today. Major amounts of healthy nutrients are needed to be replaced back into our soils.
 The three main nutrients needed by our soils are nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. These three nutrients form the foundation of a plant’s nutrition.
 Nitrogen plays a major part in a plant’s life. It works with chlorophyll, which is used by plants and sunlight to produce sugars. It helps plants to make protein that makes them strong and healthy.
 Healthy soils containing the right amount of phosphorus help plants to store energy, help to provide plants with strong healthy root systems and the general vigor and health of all plants.
 Potassium controls water and many other different chemicals found inside plants that help plants to function well. Potassium also controls the absorption of water into the pores of a plant.
 Only when plants have access to all the beneficial nutrients they need, in the soil they are grown in, can you simply feed the plants water.
 Until next time let’s all try to garden with nature not against it and maybe all our weeds will become wildflowers.

The project went public at the end of last year when the Haines City Economic Development Council announced Carvana’s plans to bring the vehicle reconditioning plant here. A tremendous amount of planning went into the plan beforehand.


  On Sept. 3, 2019, the Haines City Commission approved the sale of two parcels totaling almost 37 acres located at 3801 and 3901 County Road 544. The company paid nearly $1 million for the two pieces of property. Then, on Sept. 16, 2019, the Polk County Board of County Commissioners unanimously approved a 10-year economic development ad valorem tax exemption to the company.


  Some job announcements for the location have already begun to appear online.

Williams, who is entering his final season under contract, was a second-round draft choice out of Utah in 2017. He was highly regarded in college for his ability to locate, run down and intercept deep passes.
 Those same skills have been evident in the NFL as well. He had four regular season interceptions as a rookie and another in the playoffs.
 He had four more interceptions last season, returning one for a touchdown. Along with 10 interceptions in three seasons, he also has two forced fumbles and a fumble recovery.
 “He has good instincts and range,” Saints coach Sean Payton said of Williams this week. “He can break (on the ball), and each year we’ve been able to see his instincts on the back end.

PENN YAN — The punishment for Barrington’s former code enforcement officer does not include any time behind bars.


  Yates County District Attorney Todd Casella said John Griffin was sentenced last Thursday in county court by Judge Jason Cook to 150 hours of community service and a $1,000 fine for criminal impersonation.


  Griffin was convicted of the misdemeanor charge by Cook following a non-jury trial in March. Cook acquitted Griffin on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and issuing a false certificate.


  The charges were related to Griffin’s actions in 2014 and ’16, when he was accused of issuing two certificates of occupancy to The Olney Place on Route 54 in Barrington. Casella said Griffin impersonated a state Liquor Authority employee at the business.


  The Olney Place is owned by Seth Olney, who filed lawsuits against Griffin and the town over permits, certificates of occupancy, and a liquor license after Olney completed an expansion project. The Liquor Authority later ruled in Olney’s favor, a decision backed by a judge.


  Olney, who attended Griffin’s sentencing, sent an email to the _Finger Lakes Times_ over the weekend with the details, which Casella confirmed. In the email, Olney said of Griffin: “I am almost positive that everyone in the room was shocked with the words he chose to use in an attempt to defend himself to the bitter end. The transcripts will be interesting to read.”


  Casella declined to comment on the sentence. Assistant DAs Alyxandra Stanczak and Mike Tantillo prosecuted the trial.


  Last month, Cook denied a motion by Griffin’s attorney Travis Barry to vacate Griffin’s conviction. Barry has not replied to several emails from the _Times_ seeking comment on the case.


  Griffin has not been Barrington’s code enforcement officer since 2017, when he was not reappointed by the Town Board.

One of the best political photos I've ever seen is one of Allen Ellison, candidate for Florida Congressional District 17, in a church surrounded by supporters, many of whom are reaching out to lay hands on him in the time- honored, traditional way of extending peace and blessings. His ground game appeared set: reach as many churches in his district, touch a lot of healing hands, and turn those blessings into voters.


  But God disposes after man proposes and the pandemic put paid to all those plans. But rather than wait for the plague to end, Ellison adapted. He began broadcasting a series of town hall meetings, virtual affairs where he was able to bring in speakers and entertainers with national reputations to boost his campaign and discuss substantive issues, from veterans who commit suicide to climate change to the pandemic and beyond.


  Many studies have been done and books written on the impact of blacks on sports, but the most repetitive themes concern speed and verticality. When the Negro Leagues were in existence, its players played a speedier, more entertaining game than did their white baseball league peers, emphasizing base-stealing and pickoffs. Likewise, college and pro basketball basically resembled the girl's game before Pat Summit, in which a premium was placed on things like two-handed set-shots and multiple passes from stationary positions. Back then, it was considered good basketball if every team member touched the ball before it was shot. Good basketball, yes, but boring.


  All that changed with integration. Suddenly basketball and baseball got faster and more exciting. Folks like Maury Wills and Jackie Robinson brought an unrivalled speed and excitement to the game. And in basketball, the ground game turned into what we know now, a flying circus of half-court passes, dunks, and aerial exchanges between leaping scorers and alert back-court men skilled in lofting the alley-oop. Just as in sports, those who master the air game first became victors.


  I'm writing this as I look at a clunky Facebook ad from Greg Steube, the incumbent. His pet themes, gun control, the border, support for police, and manufactured mania about a green new deal, are all derivatives of the message from Donald Trump's Washington. Both his message and delivery are about as old-fashioned as fear and as modern as basketball knee guards (remember them?).


  In contrast, Ellison, has transformed central Florida politics with an air game that may serve as a primer for politicians to come. His embrace of social media represents, to borrow his campaign ad, a new way forward. I attended a recent campaign meeting and was struck both by the diversity of his team and the breadth of the geography they represented. Ellison's district is the largest in Florida and third largest in the country. From the east coast of Florida to our spot of sunshine, from north where there's no sand to south where the balmy breezes flow, Ellison's diverse group spoke to the pluralistic multiculturalism of our nation and also a new way of doing things. His campaign manager never met a text, Instagram, or Medium message she didn't like. His social media person is a clever goth type who's able to put her finger on every trend and viral eruption that disturbs the cyber-firmament. Ellison's air game has enabled him to go vertical, to soar over the barriers imposed by stay-at-home orders to reach constituents he once would have had to track down in person.


  There's an old myth about Antaeus, a powerful wrestler who always won his bouts as long as his feet remained planted on Mother Earth. Hercules beat him by lifting him into the air. Likewise, too many institutions and individuals are still pursuing a ground game, drawing strength from a belief that one day the pandemic will just go away. They're ground-pounders, stuck in place. And when the world does starts spinning again, they may find that life has passed them by. Unless, that is, they go vertical, as Ellison has done, with an air game to replace the old ground game.

A Punta Gorda woman was charged with driving under the influence after allegedly crashing into a telephone pole and a car with her 5-year-old daughter in her car.

  A short time later Charlotte County deputies were called to the scene of a crash in the parking lot of an apartment complex in Port Charlotte.


  Deputies say they found Winona Maria Zolnowski in her heavily damaged car trying to drive it. The car was so damaged that it would not move.


  Zolnowski's 5-year-old girl told deputies "her mommy came from a place in Punta Gorda where she had been drinking," the report said.


  The daughter was released to a person known to her, deputies said.


  Zolnowski was charged with DUI, DUI with damage to property or person of another, driving with a 0.15 or higher or with person under 18 in the vehicle, possession of more than one valid drivers license, willfully abuses a child without causing great bodily harm and leaving the scene of a crash involving property damage.

Gov. Tom Wolf reiterated his recommendation Thursday that high school sports not be played this fall in Pennsylvania.


   


  He spoke at an afternoon news conference one day before members of his staff were scheduled to speak with PIAA officials Friday afternoon. The meeting was confirmed by PIAA Executive Director Bob Lombardi on Thursday.


   


  "I'm not sure what they can say that would make me change my sense of what I think is the right thing to do," Wolf said of the PIAA. "They have a decision to make on their own, and I'm just one person that has an opinion. We have to stage this reopening, and getting back to life and to do that, we require a robust testing regime and we're not there yet."


   


  The PIAA voted Aug. 7 to delay fall sports by two weeks so the organization's officials could meet with Wolf's administration and discuss his "strong recommendation" to suspend sports until at least Jan. 1, 2021. Wolf released the recommendation on Aug. 6, noting that it was not an order or a mandate.


   


  Lombardi, who said he has not spoken with Wolf since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, sent a letter to Wolf's office to ask for a meeting.


   


  "I haven't seen it, but I think I did get the letter. We are in touch with the PIAA and trying to do everything we can to get our kids back to learning," Wolf said. "I don't see how transporting kids across county borders will help with the mitigation effort. Lets put that on pause and the focus should be on learning."


   


  Pennsylvania Secretary of Health Rachel Levine also spoke at the news conference and mentioned the recent cancellation of fall sports by the Big Ten and Pac-12 conferences. She also said that other states are reporting children getting sick from COVID-19 and developing long-term effects.


   


  "What we need to be focused on is getting our kids back to learning and to get an education. Anything we do that interferes with that in the short run we need to be careful about doing," Wolf said. "Transporting people for whatever reason across county boundaries to congregate together to the extent we do those things, whether it's a directive or recommendation, we make it harder for our kids to get the education they need to get.


   


  "We need them in school and we need them to get back to learning. When things interfere with that, it's doing a disservice to all of Pennsylvania."


   


  The PIAA is set to meet again Aug. 21 with fall practices scheduled to start on Aug. 24 and the start of the regular season for all sports on Sept. 11.


   


  "When I make a recommendation, I'm trying to do the best thing I can," Wolf said. "I'm a parent, and my kids were PIAA athletes, and I'm sure the priorities in my family would put education above sports."

While the short video is made up of out-of-context clips such as "It was a lie that I held onto for like, 10 years," Cyrus' relevant disclosure — "I didn't go all the way with a dude until I was 16, but I ended up marrying the guy" — is pretty hard to misinterpret.

In October 2017, Adnan Abu Walid al-Sahrawi, a Sahrawi Islamic militant and leader of the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, led the Tongo Tongo ambush against Nigerien and US soldiers outside the village of Tongo Tongo, Niger, killing five Nigerian and four US soldiers. Anderson said he is one of many VEO leaders Africom is pursuing. Anderson stated that, similarly to how they were able to eliminate Droukdel, a cooperative effort from multiple countries is key. “And that’s where I see this going after whether it’s Sahrawi, whether it’s Droukdel, or other leaders that are in the region, terrorist leaders. We partner to go after them, and we can – no one nation can do that alone. So, I think it’s important to emphasize the criticality of that partnership, and sometimes that partnership is behind the scenes and quiet, but nonetheless, it is vital.” Africom is also pursuing the leadership of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Jama’at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin and al-Qaida affiliates in the Western Sahel.

According to Tobin, medical professionals are still in the process of understanding the effects of psilocybin on a neurological and biochemical level. "Basically psilocybin allows people to face certain parts of their life or life story that are really difficult to look closely at in normal states of consciousness," he explains. "It allows a person to kind of come to terms with the truth of their situation and see clearly what's important to them."
