Secrets can be nearly impossible to contain, and such is the case with Hidden Pond Resort. After my visit to this secluded spot, tucked into a 60-acre pocket of Kennebunkport on the southern coast of Maine, wild horses couldn't keep me from dishing about my discovery.      Sure, I was already familiar with walkable downtown Kennebunkport. Its greenways and charming streets hold a special place in my heart. It feels like time travel to a town where people still stroll, couples walk hand in hand, and everyone greets each other.      I was shocked when my sister, Cheryl, who resides less than two hours south, confessed she'd never been there. In an instant, the idea to celebrate her upcoming birthday at Kennebunkport's much-acclaimed Hidden Pond was hatched.      Check-in at Hidden Pond takes place in a building nestled in the depths of a birch tree forest that was part of an old estate. Here, we were given a map of the property and pointed to the road where we'd find our accommodations, aptly named The Stargazer. We were impressed with this bi-level, two-bedroom, three bath cottage -- and even more impressed by its interior, with its screened porch, full kitchen and dining room, fireplaced living room and outdoor shower.      The bedrooms were equally luxurious, no quibbling necessary. We left our luggage in our respective rooms and headed back out to locate The Tree Spa, where pre-scheduled aromatherapy massages were calling our names. The surrounding beauty of nature distracted us from following our map, however, and we walked straight past Earth, Hidden Pond's critically raved-about restaurant. Once we backtracked our steps, we stopped inside the restaurant for direction. Inside, we admired its eclectic decor, and outside, the saltwater pool was inviting, and right behind the pool, voila ­-- the Tree Spa. Ensconced in treehouse-style massage rooms, we inhaled both the aroma of the pine trees outside and the lavender oil being expertly rubbed onto our skin.      Afterward, relaxed and rubbery, we called one of Hidden Pond's complimentary shuttles, with the goal of hitting happy hour at Hidden Pond's sister property, The Tides Beach Club.      The club's unobstructed view of Goose Rocks Beach and the crash of waves against the rocks mesmerized us as we sipped on a pair of watermelon Cosmos. Could it get any better? Why yes, it could, I realized as I tucked into a best-of-my-life Maine lobster roll, paired perfectly with a glass (or two) of chilled Chablis. The club's bar scene was lively, and we met a few patrons who said they'd returned to Hidden Pond twice, thrice or four times. This was not all that surprising.      Energized and not quite ready for the night to end, we stopped by the resort's communal firepit and indulged in s'mores, with all the luxury makin's ready for use, courtesy of Earth restaurant.      My sister is an early bird, and by the time I wandered downstairs from my blissful night's sleep, she had already dug into the coffee and pastries conveniently left on our doorstep. This was a "light" breakfast, but a heartier version is available at Earth.      We had a game plan for Cheryl's birthday and were soon on the road to Ricker Hill Orchards, a ninth-generation family farm about 60 minutes inland, to pick organic apples. Apple picking made us hungry, so we fueled up at Terry & Maxine's in the town of Turner. Their turkey and Swiss Rachel sandwich hit the proverbial spot.      Next stop, downtown Kennebunkport. As I'd hoped would happen, Cheryl was enchanted by the town and its unique shops, eateries and art galleries lining the charming streets.      Back at Hidden Pond, we headed to its garden shed, where we were encouraged to grab a vase and clip an arrangement of local wildflowers to grace the table at our cottage.      As the climax to this birthday weekend, I had arranged dinner for us at Earth. Our farm-to-fork meal featured an innovative menu created by Hidden Pond's Executive Chef Joe Schafer. It incorporated vegetables and herbs picked from Earth's on-site organic farm, freshly caught seafood and meats sourced from local purveyors.      No late-night s'mores for us this evening; we simply rolled back to The Stargazer cottage, flicked a switch, and chilled out by the gas fireplace for a while. We checked out the following morning, begrudgingly, as we longed to stay forever, hidden in the fold of Hidden Pond. Alas, it was time to return to real life.

- The new 4 Series will take cues from Concept i4- Large-size Kidney Grille is inevitableBMW is currently working on the coupe version of the G20 3 Series. Under the Bavarian carmaker’s new naming strategy, the coupe and cabriolet version of the 3 Series sedan will adopt a 4 Series moniker. We have already seen a glimpse of the upcoming 4 Series in the form of the Concept i4. Now, our spy sleuths have captured the 4 Series family undergoing testing. Along with it, the M4 performance version was also spotted not caring to hide its massive grille anymore.The new 4 Series Coupe, Convertible and the M4 are caught on many occasions ranging from winter testing in Lapland to burning rubber at the Nurburgring. As we have seen on the Concept i4, the 4 Series won’t have a 3 Series sedan’s headlamp design. It will adopt an 8 Series-like styling for the headlight which will be flanking the extravagantly huge Kidney Grilles. The higher variants like the M40i will have a mesh grille design. Whereas, we expect vertical louvres for the standard trims. There are separate louvres present on either side but these might be faux intakes, we reckon.Unlike the previous-gen 4 Series, the new 4 Cabriolet will adopt a soft-top. The top-down images of the convertible reveal the rear seats won’t be very spacious. Apart from that, the wind deflector is also present behind the front seats. At the back, the tail lamps design will also be similar to ones seen on the 8 Series Coupe rather than what is present on the 3 Series. The dual-exhaust ports hint the sporty intentions of the 4 Series.Meanwhile, the 4 Gran Coupe is also in works, which is a 4 Series Coupe but with four doors. It will join the 4 Coupe and Cabriolet and will take styling cues from the larger 8 Series Gran Coupe. On the other hand, we also know an M derivative of each of the body style will also arrive shortly after. The M4 spotted here gets the usual recipe of massive wheels, lowered ride height, flared wheel arches, aggressive bumpers and quad exhaust at the back.In terms of powertrain, the standard 4 Series will borrow the engine and gearbox from the 3 Series. So the 2.0-litre four-cylinder engines will be joined by the bigger straight-six units. Although there are no hybrids planned for the 4 Series, BMW is working on an all-electric version of the 4. To be called the i4, the pure electric sedan will be sold under the iNext sub-brand. On the other hand, the M4 will get BMW's S58 3.0-litre turbocharged inline-six making around 480bhp in the standard guise or around 510bhp in the Competition trim. Power will be sent to all-four wheel through an automatic gearbox, however, a manual transmission is also on the cards.The new 4 Series was expected to arrive later this year with market launch in 2021. However, it might be delayed a few months owing to the ongoing pandemic. Indian debut will happen only after the 4 Series goes on sale in the international market.

SHOW LOW—Accused murderer Louis Martin Villa appeared in the Show Low Justice Court for a preliminary hearing on March 30, accompanied by his court- appointed attorney. The Navajo County Attorney’s Office has charged Villa, 52, with the murder of one Tyler Alexandre, 31, a Class 1 felony, and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, a Class 3 felony, also against Alexandre.


  Villa is accused of assaulting and killing Alexandre with a knife during a camping trip on March 23, about one mile from SR 260 off of Joe Tank Road.


  The purpose of a preliminary hearing is so that a judge can determine if the county attorney’s office has probable cause, meaning some reasonable evidence, to support the charges. Villa waived his right to that hearing and the case proceeded to the Navajo County Superior Court.


  Court records say that Villa allegedly called 9-1-1 emergency at 4:45 a.m. on March 23 and told the dispatcher that “he had killed someone who just tried to kill me.” Show Low police officers and Navajo County sheriff’s deputies responded to the caller’s location. Once there, they report that an “unidentified male was found deceased at the scene outside of a truck,” the report says. The victim had “severe knife wounds in the area of his neck and possibly spanning across his neck,” it says. They noted that a dog was loose in the area.


  The report says that Villa, who had been drinking, had blood on his clothes and on his hands, and told officers that he “had (expletive) killed him” because Alexandre had tried to steal Villa’s truck. Then the officers, referring to the body lying on the ground next to a truck, asked Villa, “Who’s your buddy?” Villa replied, “Not my buddy.” The report then notes that there was a knife on the dashboard of the truck. They arrested Villa, about five hours after they showed up.

HIBBING, Minn. (AP) — U.S. Steel plans to indefinitely idle the Keewatin Taconite plant in northern Minnesota because of the drop in demand for iron and steel during the coronavirus pandemic.


  Officials said the closure will affect 75 employees "near term," but a total of 375 employees will be affected over the next month.


  In a statement Thursday, U.S. Steel said the company must make additional adjustments to its raw materials production and idle the Keetac plant in response to the "sudden and dramatic decline in business conditions" resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Star Tribune reports the state of Minnesota has been notified.


  The temporary closure marks the second one announced this week for mines on Minnesota's Iron Range. Cleveland-Cliffs said Monday it was idling Northshore Mining's Babbitt and Silver Bay operations in Minnesota through August and its Tilden mining operations in Michigan through July.

Solskjaer's men host Hull on Saturday knowing a victory could see Cardiff move out of the bottom three.


  Four of Cardiff's five Premier League wins have come at home and the Welsh club should be hopeful of sealing success this weekend against a side that has a similarly dismal away record.


  Steve Bruce's team are three points clear of the drop zone and have emerged victorious in only two league games on their travels this season, although Hull were 2-0 winners at Sunderland on their last Premier League away day.


  And Solskjaer is determined to ensure that Cardiff do not miss the opportunity to claim maximum points against one of their fellow strugglers.


  "The lads know the importance of the game," Solskjaer said. "This is probably the best training week we've had and we're feeling good.


  "Hull have done well, but we're both in similar situations. We both need the points on Saturday.

PINEDALE — Dawson Gardner, 20, of Clay Springs, has been charged with two counts of sexual conduct with a minor, both minor Class 6 felonies. The six foot, two inches tall Alabama native is accused having sexual relations with a 16-year old girl in Pinedale; she is reportedly a sister to one of Gardner’s male friends.


  According to court records, authorities received a report about an incident at a home in Pinedale where it is alleged that on March 19, Gardner had held down a minor girl during a sexual encounter; the encounter reportedly included intercourse. During their investigation, authorities noted bruising to the girl’s shoulder and arm. However, Gardner was not charged with sexual assault or restraining the girl. In fact, the two, Class 6 felonies he faces are the least serious of any of the felonies. Had the alleged victim been under the age of 15 years the class of felony would have been much more serious, a Class 2 felony to be exact.


  Gardner lists his address as being in Clay Springs. He was arrested on March 22, his birthday, and at his initial appearance the court set his bond at $150,000. Law enforcement reported that Gardner is from Alabama and that he had made statements about planning to return there. Gardner hired the Nolan Law Firm of Mesa, his bond was lowered to $5,000. He posted that and he is out of jail for the time being. Release conditions say that he must not have any contact with any person under the age of 18.


  If convicted, Gardner could be sentenced to prison anywhere from four months up to two years. If he is placed on probation, he could be required to register as a sex offender and serve up to one year in the county jail.


  Gardner is presumed by law to be innocent and his next court date, a preliminary hearing in Show Low Justice Court, is set for May 4.

So far, more than a month since the game stopped, there is still no concrete date in place for the return of the Premier League or other sporting activities.


  Clubs and league authorities, however, met on Friday as part of a series of summits aimed at getting the top flight back on track, although a resolution still appears to be some distance away.


  "We are acutely aware of the distress Covid-19 is causing and our thoughts are with all those directly affected by the pandemic," an FA spokesman said.


  "In common with other businesses and industries, the Premier League and our clubs are working through complex planning scenarios. We are actively engaging with stakeholders, including broadcast partners, and our aim is to ensure we are in a position to resume playing when it is safe to do so and with the full support of the Government.


  "The health and wellbeing of players, coaches, managers, club staff and supporters are our priority and the League will only restart when medical guidance allows."

Other options which are less likely to be pursued in the immediate future would be to acquire the Su-57 next generation fighter, or else to select the Su-35 as the winner of the MMRCA tender, with these heavyweight jets again retaining a sufficient performance advantage to reliably overcome the new JF-17 variant - and almost certainly its stealthy successor the stealthy Project AZM fighter as well. A Su-57 purchase remains highly likely by the mid-late 2020s, either as part of a licence production deal or as an off the shelf purchase. India is also jointly developing a new hypersonic air to air missile for the Su-30MKI with similar capabilities to the R-37 but a slightly longer range - and while intended primarily to neutralise enemy support aircraft a variant capable of threatening fighters could also become available.

Just because someone doesn't speak about what they're going through doesn't mean they're always happy. Even if you have fame and success, it doesn't make you immune to pain.

I want to go back, Carl, to some of your commentary with respect to the lack of write-offs and impairments and that's something that obviously has been challenging in sector wide with a lot of downward surprises by many of your peers. So just curious on maybe the rationale or the philosophy about when you guys bring that biological asset into inventory, I don't know if you can get into the details of pricing assumptions, but maybe just the overall - the methodology of how you're confident that the way you're coasting that is ahead of the curve, given what many anticipate is going to be a commoditization as the sector evolves. I think that you commented on in the past that you're not as bearish on that, particularly with your product line up. But just to mitigate, maybe potential future risks of impairments, just given how much capacity is out there.

Andrea Mandorlini's side raced into a three-goal lead before the break as strikes from Bosko Jankovic, Romulo and Luca Toni looked to have set them up for a comfortable victory.


  However that proved to be far from the case as the hosts replied in the second half through Paulinho and Leandro Greco, leaving Verona with a nervy final 17 minutes to hold on for the points.


  Their win put pressure on fifth-placed Inter to get a result a couple of hours later, and Walter Mazzarri's side could only manage a 1-1 draw at San Siro with Cagliari.


  The visitors went in front in the 40th minute when Mauricio Pinilla tucked home a penalty and although Rolando equalised six minutes after the break, the draw means Inter now hold just a one-point advantage over Verona.


  Another side to make ground on Mazzarri's men were city rivals Milan, who continued their resurgence under Clarence Seedorf with a comfortable 2-0 win at 10-man Sampdoria.


  Adel Taarabt opened the scoring in the 12th minute then turned provider just before the hour-mark when he crossed for Adil Rami to head home, before Maxi Lopez was sent off for the hosts after receiving two cautions for dissent.


  Juventus extended their unbeaten run in Turin derbies to 16 matches as Carlos Tevez's 30th-minute strike earned them a 1-0 win against Torino, a result which sends Antonio Conte's men nine points clear at the top of the table.


  At the bottom, Chievo climbed out of the relegation zone with a crucial 2-0 home win over fellow strugglers Catania.


  Cyril Thereau's penalty on 37 minutes and Luca Rigoni's strike midway through the second half earned Chievo their first win in 10 matches and deepened the visitors' woes.


  Elsewhere, two goals from Stefan Radu and one from Miroslav Klose helped Lazio to a 3-2 win over bottom side Sassuolo, while Antonio Di Natale's 71st- minute penalty rescued a point for Udinese in a 1-1 draw with Atalanta.

  During times like this (I hope I never see the likes of this again), it can be difficult to remember what we should be grateful for. I'm grateful for a roof over my head, food in my belly, good health and the good health of my loved ones and, hopefully, a thriving business when it's up and running again. I think it's important to pause in the midst of our busy lives, take a few deep breaths and experience the healing energy of gratitude -- to focus on the positive, not the negative, during the coronavirus.


  While we self isolate, take a look around at your family members. When will you have another opportunity to spend so much time with them? To give your full attention to your children and answer their questions and be fully present for these teachable moments. To lead by example (flip out in private, please) so that you reassure your kids that everything will be OK; different but OK.


  I hope that we, as a society, make the necessary changes so that we have a more equitable society -- housing, food, jobs, education and health care for everyone! A government that works for all of us, not just the advantaged. We, the people, can make this happen. We have the power with our votes!


  My wish for this holiday season is that we no longer turn a blind eye to all forms of injustice, from racism to income inequality. It's time to pull together and remember what binds us, not what separates us. We're all human, regardless of race, religion, political beliefs, etc. We all have similar needs -- to love and be loved, to work at something meaningful and to feel that our lives matter.


  I love reading stories about how so many people are pitching in to help their neighbors and others through this pandemic. I hope we don't forget what we've learned when our lives go forward to our new normal.


  I know how difficult it is to \"look on the bright side of things\" during a time of such uncertainty. For those of you suffering from depression, substance use disorder or other forms of mental illness, please know that there is help just a phone call or email away. Please reach out to those around you and let them know you're struggling. You are not alone.


  For those of you who believe in a higher power, prayer is very powerful. I can't stress enough about getting outside in the sun and fresh air. You don't even have to go for a walk; just sit outside in nature and take some deep breaths.


  A word about fostering and adopting a pet during this time. Only do it if you can take care of an animal's needs after you return to work. If you don't have the time, energy or finances to properly care for a pet going forward, please don't adopt. That cute animal depends on you for food, love, health care, etc. It's a responsibility to take care of another being (something like kids) and not something to do halfway.


  We have two cats (Coco and Lucy) and my precious Pomeranian, Teddy, inherited from my son (sometimes I prefer the dog to the adult child!). I've fallen totally in love with him and vice versa. I work from home so my pets get plenty of attention but that's not everyone's lifestyle.


  This is a good time to reach out to others while you're self isolating. I've been keeping in touch with people around the country (and I'm not on social media!). I call, text or email on a regular basis to make sure those I love are OK. Yes, it's time consuming, but well worth it.


  I'm enjoying this time where life is a little slower and I feel more connected to people than ever before. I will continue to keep in touch after life returns to a more hectic routine. I don't want to forget what I've learned during this time.


  Let's all move forward into the future more aware of those around us -- to offer a smile or a helping hand when needed. God bless.

Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Friday defended his decision to restart economic activity in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, after sacking his health minister over differences in how to tackle the disease.


  Luiz Henrique Mandetta, the dismissed health minister, had been advocating social distancing in line with World Health Organization recommendations, with the virus outbreak claiming more than 1,900 lives so far in Brazil.


  But the far-right Bolsonaro has argued that the measures would wreck the economy and create greater long-term risks to public health.


  "This struggle to start opening up for business is a risk that I will take," Bolsonaro said Friday as he installed his new health minister, Nelson Teich.


  If the epidemic "gets worse, that will be on me. But I think -- and lots of people are coming to realize this -- that we have to open up."


  The governors of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro were moving in the opposite direction on Friday, however, extending partial quarantines in their states which only allow key economic activities to go on.


  Bolsonaro sacked Mandetta after weeks of public clashes over how to contain the deadly outbreak.


  "Mandetta's vision was that of health, of life. Mine is more than life, it includes the economy and jobs," Bolsonaro said.


  Teich, a renowned 62-year-old oncologist, did not propose any concrete measures in his brief inaugural speech, but insisted he would strive to balance both outlooks.


  "We can talk about health, the economy, it doesn't matter: at the end of the day we are talking about people. That is what we are here to do, to bring a better life to Brazilian society and people," the new minister said.


  Nevertheless, Bolsonaro himself admitted he lacks the power to force his vision on states' governors, who have the authority to impose their own measures against the virus.


  As of Thursday, 1,924 people had died of coronavirus in Brazil, a country of more than 210 million.


  Health officials have confirmed 30,342 cases, although experts say the real number could be five times that, owing to a lack of testing and the frequency of infected people not showing symptoms.


  Sao Paulo, the most populous state in the country, has suffered the highest tolls with 850 deaths and 11,500 confirmed cases.


  Authorities there announced they would extend until May 10 restrictions on all but essential services, a measure first introduced in late March.


  Rio de Janeiro said it will prolong its own similar measures until the end of April.


  Many Brazilians were disturbed by Mandetta's dismissal, fearing a renewed outbreak of the coronavirus if social distancing measures are relaxed too soon.


  "It was a bad idea" to sack Mandetta, said Rio police officer Marcelo Ferreira. "He was doing a good job, helping keep people safe, asking them to stay home."

Well shy of the winter holidays of charity and good cheer, much of the world is now in a spirit of generosity and forbearance toward debt – all in response to the unprecedented impact of the pandemic on vulnerable people and countries.


  On Wednesday, 20 of the world’s richest nations agreed to freeze the debt obligations of about a quarter of humanity that live in the poorest 76 countries. The Group of 20 encouraged private creditors to also provide short- term relief.


  A couple of days earlier, the International Monetary Fund announced an immediate standstill for debt owed by 25 developing countries. The IMF will rely on a special $500 million fund for “catastrophe containment and relief.”


  Within countries, both elected leaders and private lenders are stepping up to ease the financial obligations of such groups as small businesses, renters, or people saddled with student loans.


  In the United States, for example, many car companies are letting borrowers defer repayments on auto loans. Under a program from Freddie Mac, landlords with multifamily housing are allowed to defer loan payments for 90 days. And the federal CARES Act passed last month has forgiveness of new loans written into many provisions as well as forbearance toward existing loans.


  Because of the magnitude of the COVID-19 emergency, perhaps never before has the world had to come to grips with the nuanced difficulties of debt relief on such a large scale. By one estimate, 1 in 5 emerging market countries will default on debt obligations because of the financial damage from the coronavirus.


  “No region can win the battle against COVID-19 alone,” stated European countries in an appeal to provide debt relief for poor nations.


  The necessity of mass debt relief is not new to global leaders. After World War II, Germany was granted generous relief on old debts which resulted in a strong economy today that is an anchor for the Europe’s stability and prosperity. Starting in the 1980s, one debt crisis after another forced fresh thinking about the benefits and hazards of forgiving or deferring the debt of financially troubled countries. Will debt tolerance only encourage risky behavior in the future?

“At this point, it’s still up in the air,” he said. “There are a lot of things we need to work on with the company.”


  FCA said last week that during the current pause in production, the company has worked with government officials and the UAW to implement new procedures to “certify the daily wellness of the workforce.”


  That includes redesigning work stations to maintain proper social distancing, and expanding the “already extensive cleaning protocols” at all its manufacturing locations.


  Ward said even with the extensive cleaning of the plants, some workers are worried about coming back as the number COVID-19 cases continues to grow across the state.


  “I know that people want to get back to work, and we want everybody back at work,” he said. “We want to be selling a lot of cars. But there’s nervousness across the board; not just from the UAW people, but from the salaried people as well.”


  Ward said Local 685 will hold a podcast meeting on April 21 to update members on new policies, and also take questions about returning to work. He said union leadership will submit those questions to the company and then relay answers back to the union membership.


  “I think the more questions we ask, the safer we will be,” he said.


  Howard County Commissioner Paul Wyman said FCA has worked closely with local, state and national officials during the coronavirus pandemic, and if things continue to improve, reopening next month “may very well be reasonable.”


  “I have full confidence in FCA, that when the final return to work date is determined, they will take the necessary precautions to ensure the safety of their employees and our community,” Wyman said. “I appreciate the leadership of Fiat Chrysler and the UAW, as they persevere through these difficult times.”


  A worker at Kokomo’s Transmission Plant was the first-known case of someone testing positive for COVID-19 inside a U.S. auto plant, and was also the first case of the virus in Howard County.


  A worker at the Transmission Plant ended up dying from the virus, marking the county’s first virus-related death.

The stock market tries to set prices now for where corporate profits and business conditions will be months in the future, and some investors are focusing on the possibility that parts of the economy could reopen, even if not soon, rather than on the current dismal data. The S&P 500 is on pace for its first back-to-back weekly gain since the market began to sell off in February.


  “Just having that light at the end of the tunnel is what people really want to see,” said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade.


  He and many other analysts caution that the recent rally may have been overdone, though, and the market will likely remain volatile. Any improvement in the economy will likely be gradual.


  “There‘s the opportunity for a big letdown when we get back to work that things aren’t humming immediately,” Kinahan said.


  Among the wisps of optimism that investors were focusing on Friday:


  — A news report cited early progress in a drug candidate for the virus. Analysts cautioned that much of the encouraging data was only anecdotal, and they were hesitant to put too much stock in it.


  — President Donald Trump unveiled guidelines late Thursday for states to follow as they reopen their economies following widespread shutdowns to slow the spread of the virus.


  — Boeing, one of the stocks hardest-hit by the pandemic, said late Thursday that it will resume production of passenger jets in Washington state next week. It suspended work late last month after workers tested positive for the coronavirus.

Gonzalo Higuain's 18th-minute strike looked set to prove decisive for Rafael Benitez's side, who sit third in Serie A.


  However, substitute Calaio provided a stunning twist to an entertaining match with seven minutes remaining, beating Pepe Reina with a curling free-kick from 30 yards.


  Calaio was understandably restrained in celebration after his wonderful left- footed strike punished the hosts for not putting the game to bed.


  Napoli now sit six points behind second-placed Roma having played a game more, while Genoa remain 11th.


  After Higuain had fired wide on the turn early on, the lively Dries Mertens twice looked to find the top-right corner, narrowly missing the target with his second attempt after Mattia Perin had saved his initial effort.


  The home side's early dominance was rewarded when Higuain latched on to a perfectly-weighted throughball from Marek Hamsik before lifting the ball over Perin to take his Serie A tally this season to 13 goals.


  Genoa responded well, with Luca Antonelli heading over from a free-kick and Moussa Konate seeing a goalbound shot cleared by Federico Fernandez with Reina beaten.


  Higuain then sent a driven strike just past Perin's right-hand post before Matuzalem escaped with just a yellow card after appearing to jump into a challenge with Fernandez.


  There were further chances at either end before the interval, Mertens threatening for Napoli on two further occasions either side of Konate seeing a free header saved by Reina.


  Konate dribbled into a promising position three minutes into the second half, but was unable to capitalise as Fernandez got back to make a crucial intervention.


  A similarly fine challenge from Luca Antonini shut out Napoli's Jose Callejon before Genoa saw another opportunity go begging through Giuseppe Sculli, who was unable to hit the target after good work from Konate.


  Sculli also brought a save from Reina with Benitez's side looking vulnerable, yet it was Calaio who had the final say.


  Fiorentina twice came from behind to rescue a 2-2 draw at Parma in an ill- tempered match featuring three second-half dismissals.


  Parma moved ahead through Antonio Cassano in the 39th minute, but that strike was cancelled out two minutes later by Juan Cuadrado.


  An Amauri penalty restored the hosts' lead early in the second half and hopes of a second Fiorentina comeback were dented by the 53rd-minute dismissal of Modibo Diakite for a second bookable offence.


  However, Vincenzo Montella's men made light of their numerical disadvantage and snatched a point courtesy of Matias Fernandez's goal with five minutes remaining.


  There was still time for two further red cards as Gianni Munari and Borja Valero were sent off following an injury-time brawl.

Garry Monk's men turned in one of their best performances of the season last Thursday to give themselves a fighting chance heading to the Stadio San Paolo.


  Indeed, the only thing missing from the Welsh side's display was a goal - something they will be looking to rectify in Italy.


  Somewhat frustratingly for Monk, after watching his side fail to score against Napoli in a match they could have won, he then saw Swansea put three past Liverpool on Sunday, but to no avail as the Anfield club recorded a 4-3 win in the Premier League.


  Napoli - third in Serie A - might have some concerns about their form, having followed up the draw in south Wales with a 1-1 draw at home to Genoa in the Italian top flight.


  Rafael Benitez's side have four wins from their last 10 fixtures, but the Spaniard insists their continued involvement in three competitions is not having an adverse effect.


  "It is not a physical issue at all," he said. " The team is good and all staff are involved in both the championship and Coppa Italia - the players know they have to distribute energy.


  "Swansea played a great game against Liverpool in the weekend’s Premier League fixtures, despite losing a very close contest.


  "They could make things very difficult. We must be prepared to go the distance."


  Swansea will be looking to make it into the last 16 for the first time in their history, while Napoli lost out to Viktoria Plzen at this stage last year, suffering a 5-0 aggregate defeat.


  Napoli are likely to have Pepe Reina in goal after Rafael picked up a knee injury in the first leg.


  Swansea could hand a start to Jonjo Shelvey, who made a goalscoring Premier League return from a hamstring injury against his former club at the weekend.


  However, doubts remain over the fitness of attacker Michu, who has been sidelined with an ankle injury since December.


  In Michu's absence, Wilfried Bony has shouldered greater responsibility for Swansea and the Dutch forward heads to Italy in form, having scored twice at Liverpool to take his tally for the season to 19 in all competitions.

Jurgen Klopp's men progressed past Shakhtar Donetsk, Malaga and Real Madrid in the knockout stages to reach the 2012-13 final, before ultimately coming unstuck against fellow Bundesliga side Bayern Munich, losing 2-1 at Wembley as a result of Arjen Robben's 89th-minute winner.


  Dortmund topped Group F this term, albeit only narrowly after Arsenal and Napoli also finished on 12 points.


  While the Italian side were eliminated from the Champions League, Zenit made it through to the last 16 with half as many points, having finished second in a group dominated by La Liga high-fliers Atletico Madrid.


  Zenit's only win in Group G came against Porto, but that sole triumph combined with three draws proved enough to seal a place in the knockout rounds for the second time.


  Dortmund, by contrast, had to win four matches to guarantee their progression – with a 2-1 victory at Marseille in matchday six ultimately proving crucial.


  After enduring a shaky spell prior to the Bundesliga winter break, Dortmund looked set to return to Champions League action in fine form.


  However, the club were sensationally denied a fourth straight league win on Saturday as relegation-threatened Hamburg recorded a shock 3-0 triumph.


  Klopp's side are now 20 points behind leaders Bayern following the champions' 4-0 win at Hannover on Sunday, and a point adrift of second-placed Bayer Leverkusen.


  Zenit, meanwhile, have not played a competitive match since their final Champions League group game on December 11 due to Russia's winter break and do not return to domestic action until March 9.


  Luciano Spalletti's team sit top of the Russian Premier League thanks to a superior head-to-head record against Lokomotiv Moscow, who also have 40 points, but have been inconsistent in recent friendlies.


  CSKA Moscow, Trans and Metalurh Donetsk all suffered defeats to Zenit, but the Russians were beaten by Shakhtar Donetsk and Metalist Kharkiv.


  Spalletti will have a full squad to choose from barring any late fitness problems, meaning Salomon Rondon – a January signing from Rubin Kazan – could make his Champions League debut.


  Marco Reus returned from injury against Hamburg and will be available once again, but Mats Hummels (ankle) is a doubt and Ilkay Gundogan (compression of the spine), Sven Bender (pubic bone inflammation), Neven Subotic (knee) and Jakub Blaszczykowski (knee) are definitely out.

Canada and the United States are two very interconnected countries and, despite the border shutdown, a co-ordinated effort is underway to ensure the two countries retain their essential service connections.


  Marco Mendicino, Canada's Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, said non-essential travel across the Canada-U.S. border is designed to prevent further spread of COVID-19, but there are certain travel exemptions that have been put in place to ensure essential service sectors can continue to operate.


  "We are two very interconnected countries, not only economically but our people to people connections are very strong," he told the Sault Star in a telephone interview Friday.


  For instance, he said, there are foreign workers who enter Canada each year in the spring and fall to work in the agricultural and fishing sectors, and special provisions have been made to ensure that can still occur.


  "We want to be sure that the travel restrictions are in place to connect Canadians, but are also there in a way that allows seasonal agricultural and seafood workers to come back into Canada so that we can maintain our food security," he said.


  Mendicino said he's proud of the work the Canadian government is doing on that front.


  "It goes without saying that food is an absolute essential to our long-term health and security," he said.


  Special provisions also require that foreign workers self-isolate for 14 days in order to protect the agricultural and seafood sectors and systematic individuals are not allowed to board a plane.


  Additional regulations are also being put in place with Agriculture Canada, Health Canada and Fisheries and Oceans, to ensure proper regulatory measures are in place, he said.


  The federal government has provided $50 million of support for the industry to ensure that seasonal workers, who require lodging accommodations, can meet social distancing provisions now in effect, Mendicino said.


  "We want to protect the seasonal workers, but we absolutely need to protect our food and that is why we have put in place regulatory measures with some financial support for farmers and seafood employers who are contributing in this very important work," he said.


  Mendicino said the work is vital to Canada's food security and the government will ensure that it is protected.


  In addition, health-care workers going back and forth across the border are providing critical services to Canadians and Americans.


  "The prime minister has said this very clearly; we're working very closely with the administration south of the border. We are working on a number of fronts in a highly-coordinated fashion," he said, adding things are running smoothly.


  Meanwhile, the Northern and Rural Immigration Pilot Program, in which Sault Ste. Marie is participating continues to be important to the federal government.


  Mendicino said the project was issued because of the needs that regional communities highlighted to the federal government -- and that need is still there.


  He said immigration remains vital to Canada's economic prosperity and future, and will continue.


  He said his ministry has been responsible for repatriating thousands of Canadians, who were abroad, by getting their paperwork in order to return to Canada, organizing flights and bringing them home to their families.


  The ministry said he has also been busy contributing to the temporary foreign worker program to ensure that exemptions are in place to keep food security healthy.


  "We continue to process applications to land and established people . . . and continue to honour work visas," he said.


  "We want people to stay at home. We have seen some progress, but all progress can be lost if we lose our discipline and focus," he said.

L'intermediario finanziario che non adempie correttamente agli obblighi informativi deve risarcire il risparmiatore per la perdita subita. Vi è infatti una sorta di automatismo giuridico ("presunzione legale") che postula la sussistenza del "nesso causale fra inadempimento informativo e pregiudizio". La Prima Sezione civile della Cassazione, sentenza n. 7905 di oggi, accogliendo (con rinvio) il ricorso di alcuni obbligazionisti Parmalat contro Banca Intesa San Paolo, ha fissato, con un principio di diritto, in modo inequivocabile le conseguenze derivanti dall'omessa informazione al cliente. La Corte di appello di Firenze aveva invece accolto il ricorso della banca valorizzando la "propensione al rischio" dei risparmiatore e le "scelte pregresse" per dedurne che avrebbero comunque portato a termine l'investimento. Un argomento rigettato alla Suprema corte secondo cui la dimostrazione di una generica propensione al rischio dell'investitore, "desunta anche da scelte intrinsecamente rischiose pregresse", non può elidere il nesso causale "perché anche l'investitore speculativamente orientato e disponibile ad assumersi rischi deve poter valutare la sua scelta speculativa e rischiosa" avendo sotto mano "tutte le opzioni dello stesso genere offerte dal mercato".

Saudi Arabia and Russia signaled they may be open to further output cuts after the latest OPEC+ deal to curb global oil supplies failed to stem crude's downward spiral.


  The two nations will "continue to closely monitor the oil market and are prepared to take further measures jointly with OPEC+ and other producers if these are deemed necessary," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak and his Saudi counterpart Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said in a joint statement published Friday.


  Oil has plunged about 17% in New York since the group Sunday agreed to trim worldwide production by an unprecedented 9.7 million barrels a day, as lockdowns aimed at containing the coronavirus cause the biggest demand slump in history. Prices hit a fresh 18-year low below $19 a barrel on Friday.


  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries projected on Thursday that even full implementation of the cuts won't prevent a surplus in the second quarter, when demand for its crude will fall to the lowest in three decades.


  The joint statement on Friday echoes earlier comments by Saudi Arabia's bin Salman, who has said that his country is ready to cut oil production further if needed when the OPEC+ alliance meets again in June. "Flexibility and pragmatism will enable us to continue do more if we have to," he said on Sunday.


  The oil-price crash has been particularly painful for Russia. The nation's coffers will get less than $1 for each exported barrel of oil, according to Bloomberg calculations based on data from the Finance Ministry.


  Riyadh signaled on Friday it was making a swift start to implementing its agreed cuts, with an announcement from state-run Saudi Aramco that it would supply customers with 8.5 million barrels a day as of May 1. That's almost 4 million a day below planned sales in April.


  Nonetheless, it's uncertain whether the kingdom and its partners really have the appetite for further action right now. OPEC nations often try to support crude prices by communicating their readiness to intervene.


  "The Saudis and Russians are being proactive in providing forward policy guidance in an effort to reassure markets that they mean business when it comes to reducing their output," said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas SA.


  The 8.5 million-barrel level represents a kind of floor for Saudi oil production because cutting any further would jeopardize output of associated gas, according to Helima Croft, head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets LLC. Domestic gas demand for power generation has been rising sharply in the kingdom for years.


  The Saudis will "probably be reluctant to go below that level initially because of the desire to maintain associated gas production," she said.


  If the kingdom wanted, it could have announced cutbacks taking effect straight away. But Friday's statement made no mention of reducing production from the current record of about 12 million barrels a day until the cuts officially take effect next month.


  Saudi crude exports averaged about 9.7 million barrels a day from April 1-16, up about 40% from the same period last month, according to tanker-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.


  There's also the signal Riyadh sent with its latest official selling prices, which fine-tune the cost that customers pay in relation to international oil rates. Aramco deepened the discounts for Asian buyers in May, an indication that it seeks to preserve its share of the fastest-growing market even as the production cuts take effect.


  It's questionable too whether the 23-nation OPEC+ coalition, led by the Saudis and Russia, has the appetite for renewed negotiations following this month's epic bout. Reaching the agreement on April 12 took four days of contentious meetings, which included a walkout by Mexico and intervention by U.S. President Donald Trump.

During times like this (I hope I never see the likes of this again), it can be difficult to remember what we should be grateful for. I'm grateful for a roof over my head, food in my belly, good health and the good health of my loved ones and, hopefully, a thriving business when it's up and running again. I think it's important to pause in the midst of our busy lives, take a few deep breaths and experience the healing energy of gratitude -- to focus on the positive, not the negative, during the coronavirus.


  While we self isolate, take a look around at your family members. When will you have another opportunity to spend so much time with them? To give your full attention to your children and answer their questions and be fully present for these teachable moments. To lead by example (flip out in private, please) so that you reassure your kids that everything will be OK; different but OK.


  I hope that we, as a society, make the necessary changes so that we have a more equitable society -- housing, food, jobs, education and health care for everyone! A government that works for all of us, not just the advantaged. We, the people, can make this happen. We have the power with our votes!


  My wish for this holiday season is that we no longer turn a blind eye to all forms of injustice, from racism to income inequality. It's time to pull together and remember what binds us, not what separates us. We're all human, regardless of race, religion, political beliefs, etc. We all have similar needs -- to love and be loved, to work at something meaningful and to feel that our lives matter.


  I love reading stories about how so many people are pitching in to help their neighbors and others through this pandemic. I hope we don't forget what we've learned when our lives go forward to our new normal.


  I know how difficult it is to "look on the bright side of things" during a time of such uncertainty. For those of you suffering from depression, substance use disorder or other forms of mental illness, please know that there is help just a phone call or email away. Please reach out to those around you and let them know you're struggling. You are not alone.


  For those of you who believe in a higher power, prayer is very powerful. I can't stress enough about getting outside in the sun and fresh air. You don't even have to go for a walk; just sit outside in nature and take some deep breaths.


  A word about fostering and adopting a pet during this time. Only do it if you can take care of an animal's needs after you return to work. If you don't have the time, energy or finances to properly care for a pet going forward, please don't adopt. That cute animal depends on you for food, love, health care, etc. It's a responsibility to take care of another being (something like kids) and not something to do halfway.


  We have two cats (Coco and Lucy) and my precious Pomeranian, Teddy, inherited from my son (sometimes I prefer the dog to the adult child!). I've fallen totally in love with him and vice versa. I work from home so my pets get plenty of attention but that's not everyone's lifestyle.


  This is a good time to reach out to others while you're self isolating. I've been keeping in touch with people around the country (and I'm not on social media!). I call, text or email on a regular basis to make sure those I love are OK. Yes, it's time consuming, but well worth it.


  I'm enjoying this time where life is a little slower and I feel more connected to people than ever before. I will continue to keep in touch after life returns to a more hectic routine. I don't want to forget what I've learned during this time.


  Let's all move forward into the future more aware of those around us -- to offer a smile or a helping hand when needed. God bless.

Three months after Jim filed for divorce, Meghan alleged that she and Edmonds had a threesome gone wrong during their marriage with O'Connor, after he was spotted with her on vacation in Cabo. In a January episode of her _Intimate_ _Knowledge_ podcast, Meghan claimed she was pressured into a threesome with O'Connor, who was at the time her friend.


  0comments


  "I felt very comfortable with her, it just felt like, 'OK if I'm going do this, this can be with who and I'm comfortable with that,'" she explained. Meghan went on to say that for the rest of their marriage, whenever she and her husband would run into O'Connor, her husband acted strangely. "There was just something weird between them and there was something where they almost acted like I was the one who was out of something," she said. When asked if she thought Jim and her friend were having a longterm affair after the two were spotted together in Cabo, Meghan replied, "I don't know, I think they have probably had sex more than one time."


  Edmonds denied all accusations at the time in a statement to _PEOPLE_. "I am tired of the lies for publicity," he said. "I filed for divorce over 90 days ago. Meghan has filed as well. The marriage is and has been over. I was invited to a surprise birthday party this weekend for one of my best friends and decided to bring a date. There is no affair going on here. It has been a plus one for the weekend. The woman I am in Cabo with is not her friend. They have not spoken in over three years."

I had most of the sky before me; a canopy of stars visible from my so-called deck observatory on the back of my house. So what grabbed my attention? A couple of little patches of sky straight ahead of me on the horizon, peeking between the tree line in the back of the neighbor's field.      No craning of the neck this time!      Some of you may be graced with a clear, wide-open sky where you can pan the flat horizon all the way around in a circle. You must be living in the middle of a Midwestern ranch, on a mountain top or on a houseboat out at sea! Of course, a lot more people in rural areas are fortunate to have a really low view in the sky in at least one direction, or more than one.      Dodging trees, hills and buildings can be a challenge.      On the other hand, seeing the stars, planets and moon among the tree branches, when empty of leaves, can be very picturesque as one takes an evening stroll.      From the convenience of my backyard deck, I was thrilled to gaze with binoculars at those small gaps. I saw stars!      What was thrilling was looking due south at night, I was seeing a hint of far southern constellations, ones that never fully rise above my horizon at my latitude. These stars are wrapped in an air of mystery, an enticing invitation to want to head far south, the farther the better, as I round the Earth and see the southern stars slide higher and higher in my sky. There is a whole region of sky anyone of us above (or below) the equator can never see.      Using my star atlas, I identified those low stars in the wood line gaps as the brighter stars of the constellation Vela the Sail.      There's a good chance you northerners (like me) know very little, or maybe nothing, of Vela the Sail!      On trips to Florida and Haiti, I have had chances to see stars of the Southern Cross; Alpha Centauri, the closest star system to our Sun; and a few other constellations and notable stars I can't see at home. Yet, way below the equator, such wonders as Octans the Octant, Dorado the Swordfish, Mensa the Fly and Telescopium the Telescope await being traced and enjoyed. Folks Downunder may feel the same mystique about the Big Dipper, Little Dipper, Cassiopeia and Camelopardalis the Giraffe, far northern star patterns hidden from them.      Note, our view low to the horizon also means we are looking through a thicker layer of atmosphere. Just like the sun is dimmer and redder at sunset/sunrise, the stars are dimmed at night along the horizon. Light pollution from populated areas past the horizon can create a bright glow low in the sky.      There is also an interesting aspect of the low stars near the horizon. Thanks to the Earth's atmosphere acting like a lens, the starlight is refracted, and appears a little higher in the sky than it would if we had no air (like on the moon). That means starlight right below our flat horizon is bent and comes into view! Refraction also makes the setting and rising sun and moon distorted.      The atmosphere is most turbulent at low angles, causing a star to "twinkle" and cause poor telescopic views of planets just rising or setting.      Knowing your latitude, with the help of a good star chart you can find the limit of how far down the sky you can see from your home.      Meanwhile, enjoy brilliant Venus in the evening western sky. New moon is on April 22.      Keep looking up at the sky!      Peter Becker is managing editor at The News Eagle in Hawley, Pennsylvania. Notes are welcome at news@neagle.com.

Hammered on the scoreboard and smashed from start to finish all over the park, Wellington's evening was further soured with serious injuries sustained by defender Reece Caira and Costa Rican international Kenny Cunningham, the visitors' sole goal scorer.


  Caira suffered a fractured eye socket after being hit by Tarek Elrich’s elbow in the second half, before Cunningham was rushed to hospital in the dying moments with a suspected broken foot.


  "It's one of those days where when things go wrong, they go wrong properly," Merrick said.


  "It's a hazard of the job I guess.


  "It looks like we've got a fractured eye socket for Reece Caira and I'm not sure about Kenny, it may be a broken foot.


  "If it's a fractured eye socket (for Caira) with two months to go, he'd be struggling to come back from it (this season), I'd say."


  Notwithstanding the two casualties and the fact the Phoenix finished the match with nine players on the park, Merrick acknowledged his side, buoyant after last week's 4-1 comeback win away to the Central Coast Mariners, was destroyed by the Reds.


  "I don't think we have any excuses for a poor performance," he said.


  "I know we finished with nine players but when it was 11 v 11, we were well beaten by Adelaide.


  "They kept the ball in midfield really well, they created numerous chances, and (midfield pair) Vince (Lia) and Manny (Muscat) were outnumbered 3 on 2, in the middle of the park.


  "Adelaide came out and they were buzzing - every 50-50 they won.


  "They were first to the ball, we were always chasing, they kept possession really well and we just couldn't get into the rhythm of the game at all."


  In fact, Wellington have battled for rhythm and continuity in their defensive stocks for most of the season, a trend indicated by the fact they have leaked the most goals of any side.


  With the likes of Spanish-born left-back Albert Riera (groin) and right-back Louis Fenton (shoulder) sidelined plus Caira's serious injury, Merrick has battled to piece together something resembling a plausible back third.


  "It's been a season of patching up full back positions," Merrick said.


  "Playing a centre-back at right-back, changing the left-back because Manny (Muscat) had to move into midfield, we lost Albert Reira ... it's just been a season of patching up, changing and losing players to the national team."

Walter Mazzarri's men have been in good form this month, bouncing back from their 3-1 defeat to champions Juventus to record victories over Sassuolo and Fiorentina.


  Their latest win saw them close the gap between themselves and Vincenzo Montella's fourth-placed men to five points.


  While Fiorentina and Inter currently occupy the two UEFA Europa League spots, the former travel to Parma on Monday, with victory for the hosts keeping them firmly in the hunt for European football.


  A win for Inter at San Siro a day earlier would not only boost their hopes of qualifying for Europe's second-tier club competition, it would place even more pressure on Cagliari boss Lopez.


  Lopez's days at the Stadio Is Arenas are reported to be numbered, with president Massimo Cellino said to be less than pleased with the club's showing in Serie A this season.


  Assistant coach Ivo Pulga, suggested as a likely successor to Lopez, was dismissed this week and the Uruguayan could do with a positive result against high-flying Inter, with the Sardinians having won just one of their last nine Serie A matches.


  Cagliari have a reasonable recent record against Inter, avoiding defeat in each of their last four games, although three of these have been draws.


  Inter last beat Cagliari in November 2011 thanks to goals from Thiago Motta and Philippe Coutinho, with defender Hugo Campagnaro claiming all of Inter's efforts are now focused on victory this weekend.


  After Mazzarri brought in the likes of Hernanes, Ruben Botta and Danilo D'Ambrosio last month, Campagnaro explained to _Mediaset_ : "There has been a lot of competition in the last few weeks above all.


  "That's crucial for a team. No one feels they have a right to a starting spot, which is something that helps the team's growth.


  "In the dressing room we don't aim for a final objective. Now all our thoughts are on Cagliari."


  If Cagliari are to take anything from the game, they will need to arrest the woeful away form they have demonstrated this term.


  Lopez's side have failed to win a game on the road all season, scoring just four goals on their way to picking up five from a possible 33 points.


  Inter meanwhile have made San Siro something of a fortress - losing just once at home in Serie A.
