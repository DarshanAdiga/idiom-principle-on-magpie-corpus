Irish Illustrated’s Tim Prister broke a pair of too-close-for-comfort injury stories last week with news that both center Jarrett Patterson, and the man to his right, fifth-year senior guard Tommy Kraemer, would miss Friday’s contest—and in Patterson’s case—the remainder of the season, due to surgeries. Irish head coach Bryan Kelly confirmed those realities this week, adding a dose of good fortune accompanying the latter. Patterson is out. He had foot surgery. It went very well. He’ll recover and do extremely well,” said Kelly. “We’ll have him back obviously next year. Disappointed in him. He was having a great season. But again, I think he’ll do quite well from this surgery.

BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) — Stevie Scott III ran for three touchdowns and No. 12 Indiana had three interceptions, three sacks and a game-changing safety in a 27-11 win over Maryland on Saturday. Freshman Tim Baldwin Jr. ran for a season-high 106 yards for the Hoosiers (5-1), who have won four straight at home. The safety midway through the third quarter gave the Hoosiers a 9-3 lead, and Indiana extended the margin to 17-3 on the ensuring possession. Scott scored on a 1-yard plunge and backup quarterback Jack Tuttle completed his first throw of the day — a 2-point conversion to Peyton Hendershot. Tuttle also led the Hoosiers to two fourth-quarter scores after replacing injured starter Michael Penix Jr. “It’s not by chance, I can promise you that,\" Indiana coach Tom Allen said, referring to the defense's big plays. “Just watch the film.\" Maryland (2-2) moved the ball well in the first half but struggled in the red zone after a 21-day break stemming from a COVID-19 outbreak that caused the cancellation of two games. Taulia Tagovailoa missed two open receivers for potential scores in the first half and was picked off twice in the red zone. Also, Joseph Petrino missed a 29-yard field goal wide left on the first possession of the game. Penix struggled before heading to the locker room in the third quarter after suffering what appeared to be a right leg injury while he was getting tackled. He was 6 of 19 for 84 yards. Tuttle completed all five of his passes for 31 yards. Scott carried 24 times for 80 yards and Baldwin took advantage of his first significant action this season as Indiana rushed for a season-high 234 yards. Baldwin carried the ball 16 times after logging one carry in the Hoosiers' previous five games. Tagovailoa was 17 of 36 with 241 yards and one...

Eyebrows were raised when the fan favourite returned to his former club as temporary successor to Mourinho, having been given the green light by Molde to take charge for the remainder of the 2018-19 campaign. An outstanding interim stint led Solskjaer to take the job on a full-time basis in March 2019, with a dreadful end to that season followed by a promising 2019-20 campaign in which they finished third in the Premier League and reached three cup semi-finals. But Solskjaer's side have struggled for consistency for large patches of his tenure and Sunday's loss to Arsenal, his 100th match in charge in all competitions, was his 16th loss, leaving his win percentage standing at 49.2 per cent - the worst of those to have followed in Ferguson's footsteps.

Larry King spent his 87th birthday in the hospital this week, but now he is reportedly feeling much better. Sources close to King told _The New York Post_ he had some blood flow issue that required immediate attention. King is being held through the weekend out of an abundance of caution, but his outlook is positive.
 King's condition improved quickly, to the point where his doctors said he might be released on Friday at first. However, they opted to hold him for two more nights for observation at the last minute, though King is not worried about his condition worsening at that time. The legendary TV host has had many medical ailments over the years, but each time he has bounced back in good health. From the looks of it, this time will be no different.    __
 A source close to King previously told _The Post_ 's _Page Six_ : "Larry has been in the hospital with heart issues and other things." That news came on Thursday, Nov. 26, though the source revealed that King had been hospitalized since his birthday, Nov. 19. King turned 87 years old last Thursday and marked the milestone in the hospital.
 King's health has been a concern before, going back at least as far as 1987. At the time, he suffered a serious heart attack and then had a successful quintuple-bypass surgery, according to a report by _The Sun-Sentinel_ titled "The Nine Lives of Larry King." Since that heart attack, King has become a huge proponent of heart health and has written two books on living with heart disease.
 King had regular chest x-rays from then on to monitor his heart disease, and in 2017, these tests found a cancerous tumor in his lung. Surgeons successfully removed the tumor, and King has not had any more cancer scares since then. However, his health concerns have continued in recent years.

 In 2019, King had an angioplasty and had stents inserted. He took about four months off to recover before returning to the airwaves. A few months later, King revealed that just before the surgery, he had actually suffered a stroke, which put him in a coma "for weeks." Again, he was blunt and vulnerable when publicly discussing these issues, admitting that he contemplated suicide after the stroke. "I thought I was just going to bite the bullet. I didn't want to live this way," he told Los Angeles TV station KTLA.
 Thankfully, King survived and overcame the depression as well. King continues to appear on TV, on social media, and in podcasts today. For more up-to-the- minute news, stay tuned to PopCulture.com for the latest!

Buffalo Bills left guard Cody Ford will miss the remainder of the season due to a torn meniscus, coach Sean McDermott announced Friday morning on WGR 550.
 Per McDermott, Ford was injured during practice this week. He was listed as limited due to an ankle injury on both Wednesday and Thursday.
 Ike Boettger, 26, started in place of Ford in Buffalo's 32-30 loss to the Arizona Cardinals on Nov. 15.
 Ford, 23, has started all seven games in which he has played this season and 22 of 23 career contests with the Bills (7-3).
 McDermott also ruled out wide receiver John Brown for this Sunday's game against the Los Angeles Chargers (3-7) in Orchard Park, N.Y.
 Brown, who is nursing an ankle injury, has 29 receptions for 386 yards and two touchdowns in eight contests this season.

 # Even during a pandemic, there's plenty to be thankful for in Coshocton
 Coshocton Tribune
 View Comments
 As much of us may wish to forget it, 2020 will live long in our memories.
 The coronavirus pandemic has rightly dominated the news as it affects so many aspects of our lives. It has also shown some wonderful signs of humanity in Coshocton County.
 We are thankful for our doctors, nurses and other health workers during this pandemic, who have shown an incredible dedication to treat those infected.
 We are thankful for our public health workers, who work tirelessly to help contain the spread of COVID-19. Through contact tracing, sharing health guidance and enforcement, these workers have given so much - often for not much pay - to help keep us safe. The fact that they face so much anger makes us all the more thankful they are able to keep going.
 As both of these groups feel the strain of the pandemic during its rapid escalation, we ask others to help demonstrate their thanks by limiting the spread through social distancing, mask wearing and hand washing.
 We are thankful for technology, which has allowed us to connect with friends and family when we couldn't be face to face. While a Zoom call is not the same as a shared meal, being able to see and speak to our loved ones is a benefit previous generations wouldn't have had.
 We are thankful for time. The pandemic put plans on hold, which for many of us allowed us to re-prioritize how we were spending our time. With no events to attend, families were given the opportunity to bond at home and we were given time to journal, learn a language or relax and read a book. Let's continue to make good use of this gift where it is available.
 Of course, the pandemic has been incredibly difficult for some. The loss of employment or wages have limited some families' ability to feel comfortable eating or staying in their home. For this, we are thankful for the wonderful work by our social service organizations and compassion shown by our community.
 It may be difficult to remember now, but during the spring many local businesses and nonprofits stepped up to offer free food to those most in need. These efforts continued through the year, with schools busing food to students and non-profits providing record numbers of meals to local families. We ask our community to continue helping these efforts through the holiday season and beyond.
 And speaking of schools, we are thankful for our educators who not only face never-before seen hurdles in helping our children learn, but who also continue to go to school despite potential health risks. We understand that school leaders face difficult decisions in how to operate during a pandemic, but we know they have our kids' best interests at heart.
 Finally, we are thankful for you, our readers. Obviously without you, we at The Coshocton Tribune wouldn't exist. During a year when the news industry has been attacked, we appreciate your commitment to our mission to provide you the real stories happening in Coshocton County.
 So take a minute to think not what could have been, but what is, and be thankful for the good things that still exist.

  The Brown family had a difficult 2020, as their home in Washington was hit by wildfires as they were quarantining together during the coronavirus pandemic. In an interview with PopCulture in October, Bird Brown said the family was "currently still evacuated" after their homes were damaged. She said the timeline for their return is "pretty much up in the air." Rain said the family hs not lost all hope, adding that it is now time to "stick together." The family is hanging in with "a lot of hugs, a lot of conversation, being there for one another and just sticking together," Rain added.


  Ami and Billy "are holding up -- air quality is a big factor for my dad," Rain said, referring to her father's respiratory issues. The two spend their days with "a lot of love and a lot of oxygen," she said. "I feel like they're always the anchors," Bird said of their parents. "They're always assuring us that things are going to be OK, even when we want to assure them things are OK."

BLOOMINGTON, Ind.
 Stevie Scott III ran for three touchdowns and No. 12 Indiana had three interceptions, three sacks and a game-changing safety in a 27-11 win over Maryland on Saturday.
 Freshman Tim Baldwin Jr. ran for a season-high 106 yards for the Hoosiers (5-1), who have won four straight at home.
 The safety midway through the third quarter gave the Hoosiers a 9-3 lead, and Indiana extended the margin to 17-3 on the ensuring possession. Scott scored on a 1-yard plunge and backup quarterback Jack Tuttle completed his first throw of the day -- a 2-point conversion to Peyton Hendershot. Tuttle also led the Hoosiers to two fourth-quarter scores after replacing injured starter Michael Penix Jr.
 "It's not by chance, I can promise you that," Indiana coach Tom Allen said, referring to the defense's big plays. "Just watch the film."

The appeals are frantic, desperate calls to help fund the campaign's legal efforts to "defend the election from the radical left, the FAKE NEWS media, and BIG TECH." Of course, most of the money raised through such appeals will go to helping Trump retire campaign debt, of which he had more than $1 million as of October 14. But even if some of it really does go to Trump's doomed efforts to overturn the election through litigation and recounts, potential donors might want to think twice about how the campaign is spending its resources before sending any money.

MCPHERSON -- The city of McPherson approved more than $29 million in bonds earlier this month -- a debt that will result in increased water rates as the Board of Public Utilities inches forward with a project to build new water wells and pump that water more than 20 miles to the city.
   
 The move was not unexpected -- the project has been in the works for a couple of years. However, it is ahead of schedule. The BPU had not planned on moving forward until 2021 or 2022 with the South Well Field Project.
   
 "We started looking at it because of low interest rates," said Tim Maier, general manager of the BPU. "We had a financial adviser do an evaluation. Given the historic low interest rates he feels like is prudent to move forward with the financing."
   
 The financing of the project will be on the docket for early 2021, with construction to begin in 2022.
   
 "If we get the interest rates we are looking at, we can save between $300,000 and $400,000 a year over what the early engineering estimate was in 2019," Maier said.
   
 The bonds will financed over a 30-year period, including $27 million for project funds and $2 million for bond reserves.
   
 The project, the South Well Field Project, is the drilling of three new wells to serve the city of McPherson in the Sand Hills of Harvey County.
   
 "We have seen a decline in the aquifer," Maier said. "What we are trying to do is get a water source that is outside of the area. We are trying to ensure a long term water supply for our community."
   
 Currently the city pulls water from the McPherson Intensive Water Groundwater Use Area -- an area that can not support the current use of its aquifer. Water levels have dropped about three inches a year since 1980.
   
 The city of McPherson purchased land for new wells in 2012 and was able to get water rights in 2107.
   
 The water will be transported via pipeline to McPherson, where it will be treated before entering the municipal supply. The BPU is budgeting about $14.3 million for the pipeline, and $10.4 million for a 3 million gallon per day treatment plant.
   
 "The water is higher in manganese and iron. It is higher than acceptable levels. We will have to put in a treatment plant for that here in McPherson," Maier said. "We'll then mix it with the water supply that we have."
   
 The wells will be recharged during rain and flooding events on the Little Ark River.
   
 "This should set McPherson up, from a water supply perspective, for the next 50 to 100 years," Maier said. "This is a significant investment for the community. I understand that. Having a long term water supply is extremely important."
