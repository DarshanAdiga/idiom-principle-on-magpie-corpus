LNP Media Group journalist Brad Bumsted and Spotlight PA reporter Angela Couloumbis — along with three other journalists — spent a year digging into the campaign spending of Scarnati and other state lawmakers. What they found is that a significant portion of that spending could not be traced using the information the lawmakers’ campaigns had publicly disclosed.
 Candidates are required by state law to disclose campaign donors and expenses. But lawmakers commonly used a trick to obscure their spending, the journalists found: They listed expenses as credit card payments without detailing what the actual expenditures were.
 In his records, Scarnati used vague descriptions like “lodging” without disclosing, for instance, that the hotel stays in 2016 were in Europe — where, as far as we know, not many of his Jefferson County constituents reside.
 The Caucus and Spotlight PA journalists found that Scarnati’s shielded spending amounted to nearly $246,000, a whopping amount that was more than any of the other nearly 300 campaigns the news organizations examined.
 Scarnati spent $246 to eat dinner at an ancient restaurant in Salzburg, Austria — a reported haunt of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart — and charged his meal to his campaign credit card. He also charged other stops on his European trip, including $1,295 on lodging in Germany, and $152 for a meal in Bruges, Belgium, the latter of which is a wonderful place to find craft beers, but not Pennsylvania voters.
 State lawmakers responded not with outrage on behalf of constituents and campaign donors but by quickly attempting — mere hours after The Caucus and Spotlight PA published their original investigation — to change the law to make it harder for the public to access the records on which the investigation relied.
 That appalling and self-serving effort was thankfully scuttled the next day.
 But Scarnati clearly wants to avenge his humiliation at the hands of Bumsted and Couloumbis, who are known as excellent and dogged reporters. So his campaign filed this lawsuit, claiming that the reporters and The Caucus owed the campaign money for the huge favor of producing the — public — records sought during their investigation.
 Scarnati’s campaign had stored the public records of his campaign spending with the accounting firm Clyde, Ferraro & Co. As The Caucus and Spotlight PA recounted last week, Scarnati’s “campaign and the accounting firm initially tried to charge journalists about $2,000 for the documents.”
 But the Pennsylvania Department of State, in an October 2018 letter to Scarnati’s then-lawyer, put the kibosh on that excessive amount, pointing out that the law allows campaigns to charge only copying and delivery fees. So the journalists were charged $0.25 per page — the maximum set by the state’s Office of Open Records — plus the actual cost of delivery.
 As The Caucus and Spotlight PA pointed out, the total was “a fraction of the amount the accounting firm had originally sought.”
 Now, the Scarnati campaign’s lawsuit alleges that Bumsted, Couloumbis and The Caucus owe $5,070 for work that the accounting firm conducted to produce the public records the journalists requested.
 The campaign also seeks $1,000 for attorneys’ fees and court costs.
 This would be hilarious in its shamelessness if it wasn’t so blatant an attempt to discourage investigative journalism.

Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], September 24 (ANI): Equity benchmark indices crashed by nearly 3 per cent on Thursday following a rout in US stocks overnight while investors also battled worries over resurging COVID-19 cases in European cities.   US stocks cracked after several Fed officials suggested the US economy was worse than the market was pricing in. Besides, countries including the United Kingdom, France, Spain and the Netherlands are seeing re-emergence of virus hotspots that may lead to fresh curbs on movement and businesses.   The BSE S&P Sensex closed 1,115 points or 2.96 per cent lower at 36,554 while the Nifty 50 tumbled by 326 points or 2.93 per cent at 10,806.   All sectoral indices at the National Stock Exchange were in the red with Nifty metal down by 4.3 per cent, IT by 4.2 per cent, PSU bank by 3.9 per cent and auto by 3.6 per cent.   Among stocks, Bajaj Finance, Tata Motors, IndusInd Bank and Mahindra & Mahindra suffered losses of over 6 per cent. UPL, IndianOil Corporation, Tata Consultancy Services, Tech Mahindra and Tata Steel shed between 4.6 and 5.4 per cent.   However, those which gained marginally were Bharti Infratel, Hindustan Lever and Zee Entertainment.   Meanwhile, Asian markets fell following a slump on Wall Street overnight. A series of warnings from US Federal Reserve officials over the resilience of economic recovery left investors nervous.   Investor sentiment was weighed down by concerns that US economic recovery is slowing as the coronavirus outbreak lingers while a renewed wave of Covid-19 cases in Europe could lead to reimposed travel restrictions in several countries.   Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell by 1.82 per cent, Seoul's Kospi sank 2.59 per cent and Japan's Nikkei fell 1.11 per cent. (ANI)

Jean and Don loved to travel the United States every summer and packed up the car with their children and drove everywhere. They built a house together for their family and she made it a home. Don took care of her and made sure she had everything she wanted. He loved and respected her and she was his princess. Jean had a giving heart and enjoyed caring for her husband and children and she spoiled all of us even over her own needs. Jean loved her family as it grew to include many grandchildren and many, many more great- grandchildren. At any time she was always there for us at a moments notice to babysit or just to listen and share her wisdom and loving support to each one of us.


  Jean was a very smart woman and enjoyed watching Jeopardy, reading mysteries, crossword puzzles and jigsaw puzzles. Jean always had time to play games, any games, from board games to word games to card games with family and friends. She loved to watch tennis and bowling. In her younger years, she played volleyball, baseball and tennis. She bowled in mixed leagues with her husband and children, and she bowled in women’s leagues over the years. She was a very good bowler.


  Jean and Don both had a good time dancing every Saturday night to country music over the years. She also liked to walk the length of Central Avenue every evening that she could. Jean was an athletic woman and even in her 70s her great-grandson told her she should be on a baseball team, he thought she was so good. Jean was also a volunteer at the Mississippi River Museum, arboretum and Luther Manor playing euchre for many years. Her career was being a loving wife to Don and loving mother to her four children and making her home.


  Jean and Don took many trips to Florida to visit their daughter Karen. Karen will always remember their many long talks while walking with Jean on the beach and on the Heritage Trail in Dubuque that she will cherish forever. Rick also has fond memories of his mom on several fishing trips with his parents to Lake Okoboji and catching lots of fish. Pat has good memories of Mom just calling her to pray with her and Sunday evenings at Music in the Park with her parents. Steve’s special memory is of bowling in a mixed doubles league with his parents and winning two years in a row. One year they tied for first place and had a bowl off. Mom bowled so good she won it for them.


  She was quietly competitive and we all know that from the many games we played with her whether it was a card game or a marathon dominoes game. She liked to win! Jean gave all of us many cherished memories of family gatherings in their home from birthdays to Thanksgivings and Christmases that we will have for a lifetime.


  Jean fulfilled many roles in her life, she was a very-much-loved big sister, a beautiful loving wife to Don, and a loving guiding light to her children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren. We will all miss her laughter, her wisdom, her smile, and her gentle kindness, but mostly her bottomless supply of love and support for us all. You will be forever in our hearts and our thoughts and we know you’re with dad and Jesus.


  The family she loved so much included four children, Rick (Mitzi) Cornish, of Dubuque, Karen Cornish, of Melbourne Fla., Pat Richey, of Dubuque, and Steve (Carolyn) Cornish, of Dubuque; grandchildren Ami (Chad) Guler, of Hazel Green Wis., Christian (Kayla) Cornish, of Green Bay Wis., Sorcha Cornish-Carpenter, of Cannon Falls, Minn., Danielle Richey, of Dubuque, Brandon (Lindsey) Richey, of Cedar Rapids, Nicole Richey, of Dubuque, and Elijah Cornish, of Dubuque; grandchild-in-law, Josh Lynch, of Asbury; 13 great-grandsons; 4 great- granddaughters; sisters, Dorothy Gray, of Dubuque, Rita (James) Moran, of Dubuque, and Kay (Dennis) Strumberger, of Omaha, Neb.; and many nieces, nephews, and cousins.


  She was preceded in death by her husband, Donald Cornish; her granddaughter, Sam (Cornish) Lynch; her brother, Richard Banck and her parents.

Your neighbour wants to build a large extension to the back of their home which could block the sunlight coming into your house.
 A housing developer wants to turn the playground your kids go to after school into a new estate.
 The council plans to build a new recycling centre just down the road from your home.
 Thankfully, none of these examples are real but they serve to illustrate just how important planning issues are to our daily lives.
 Any change in our local environment can have profound consequences for us, both good and bad, depending on your viewpoint.
 Some of us might welcome a new recycling centre down the road as it will be more convenient. Others may see the additional traffic as an unwelcome nuisance.
 But, whatever your view, the important principle in our current system is that you are made aware of the proposed changes before they get the green light.
 That way, the pros and cons can be debated openly, and everyone is given the opportunity to have their say.
 This commitment to transparency is underpinned by a longstanding obligation on councils to publish planning notices in local newspapers.
 In addition to using local papers, councils are free to publicise the notices through their own channels and on social media if they wish to do so.
 And, crucially, local authorities can work with local papers to use the reach of local newspapers’ own digital channels.
 If you combine print and digital reach, local news brands now enjoy huge audiences – 40.6 million a month, according to JICREG.
 And that powerful reach and unique connection with local communities is at the disposal of councils when they need to communicate with the public.
 As an industry, we are very open to finding new and innovative ways for councils to communicate with the public.

 He wasn’t started in Arsenal’s last Premier League game against West Ham, but that doesn’t mean that he will be sold.
 Rumours have claimed that his agent is in Turkey in a bid to get him a deal with yet another Turkish side.
 However, Arsenal journalist, Chris Wheatley has come out to claim that the Egyptian, who started for Arsenal against Leicester City in the Carabao Cup, will not be sold this summer despite the rumours surrounding his future.
 He claimed that the player has confided in those that are close to him that he will not be leaving the Emirates this summer.
 He Tweeted: “Mohamed Elneny starts against Leicester today. Those close to the player tell me he’s staying at Arsenal, contrary to recent reports in the Egyptian media. #AFC #LeiArs”
 Arsenal is still being linked with a move for the likes of Thomas Partey and Houssem Aouar, signing any of them will push Elneny further down the pecking order.

As per reports, Harley's sales in India accounted for just about 5 per cent of its global total.The global prospect for Harley-Davidson is not much better despite a clear emphasis on bringing about more profitable bikes in markets such as the United States. While this is a key market for the company, it has failed to show retail sales growth in the past 14 quarters. And Covid-19 has further hammered prospects. The last quarter saw a year-on-year dip in retail sales of 27 per cent, the worst-ever in past six years.The entire restructuring cost for the year 2020 is now pegged at $169 million as the top management of the company looks at tightened supplies and production cuts. Overall, the product portfolio is expected to be trimmed by 30 per cent and renewed focus only reserved for the North American, European and select Asia- Pacific markets.Some estimates suggest that plans of Chief Executive Jochen Zeitz, who took primary charge in February, may wipe out nearly 700 positions but also save the company money to the tune of $100 million.",

Emerson Kokol has been renting a space at the CoWork Factory. He said he was looking for a place to work to get out of the house and be downtown.
 “I was looking around in San Antonio, Austin, and I didn’t want to make the drive,” Kokol said. “Then I happened upon here and thought that would work. As much as I would downplay the whole getting out of the house thing, for me, it’s a big thing, because otherwise, you feel trapped, you feel cooped up. It gets me downtown. On my lunch break, I’ll walk around, and I’ll check things out. It kind of gives you that window into what New Braunfels has.”
 Kokol said he was disappointed to hear the business was closing its doors.
 “It totally sucks because I have to find something — I can’t stay at home,” he said. “I know this about myself — if I stay at home, I will go crazy. So yeah, it’s a total bummer that it’s closing, but unfortunately, COVID has made a lot no longer viable. At least for the time being, it’s not until we figure out what the new normal is going to be.”
 Bob’s wife, Chandler, who has assisted with running the business, said they love being part of the downtown community and will miss it.
 “During our years there, we just enjoyed all of the connections that we saw being made, the collaborations that evolved by being together and the friendships that were developed,” Chandler Gray said. “One of the most fun things that I was always in awe of is the serendipity of what happens when you share your time and space together. It was magical — that’s when the collaborations in the connections developed. We’ve had to accept the fact that co-working as we all know it is not a safe thing during a global pandemic.”
 Bob Gray expressed hope that he would reopen the business at some point.
 But he doesn’t know when or if that will happen.
 “I love the business model,” he said. “I hope to do it again, but I’ve got to be patient, and I’ve really got to see when that is and where. We’d most definitely like to do it again — the sooner, the better — but that all depends on the nature of this virus and the vaccine and people’s response to it.”
 Although he has closed down, Bob Gray also expressed hope that people will continue to patronize small businesses.
 “I feel and sympathize with the restaurants, bars, musicians and numerous other small businesses in town,” he said. “We all need to support these businesses as best we can if we want them to survive this mess.”

Make sure you bring one of the 19 acceptable forms of voter identification because they’ll copy it for your application to be approved. Also, make sure to wear your mask.
 Circuit Clerk Harris or someone from her office will meet you downstairs and let you in the Courthouse.
 You’ll have your temperature taken to make sure you don’t have symptoms of COVID-19.
 Mrs. Harris’ office will give you an absentee application, a ballot and two envelopes. Once you have a ballot, vote for the candidates of their choice. Put it in a secrecy envelope, which is plain.
 Mrs. Harris’ office will even seal it for you. You then put that in the outer envelope, which has an affidavit on it, write your address on the outer envelope, and sign your name in front of two witnesses or a notary. The folks working in the clerk’s office can do this for you – they did it for me.
 Final step: check the box on that outer envelope that says “I am physically incapacitated and will not be able to vote in person on election day.”
 No matter your age or health, you check that box if you are worried about voting in person on Election Day. Even though that outer envelope says the voter is swearing she won’t provide a false reason for voting absentee, you should not worry.
 This year, the fear of COVID-19 transmission is enough. No Alabama voter will be criminally prosecuted for voting absentee, regardless of which box they check on the affidavit envelope for the general election in November.
 If we’re going to beat COVID-19 together, we’re all going to have to continue to work for positive change in our community.
 Voting is a powerful way to work together. Love your neighbor by voting in a way that shows you care about your community but also love your neighbor and yourself by keeping everyone safe. Vote early.

  The global prospect for Harley-Davidson is not much better despite a clear emphasis on bringing about more profitable bikes in markets such as the United States. While this is a key market for the company, it has failed to show retail sales growth in the past 14 quarters. And Covid-19 has further hammered prospects. The last quarter saw a year-on-year dip in retail sales of 27 per cent, the worst-ever in past six years.


  The entire restructuring cost for the year 2020 is now pegged at $169 million as the top management of the company looks at tightened supplies and production cuts. Overall, the product portfolio is expected to be trimmed by 30 per cent and renewed focus only reserved for the North American, European and select Asia-Pacific markets.

"What we've seen in our research is that the dogs will find (the disease) five days before they (patients) get any clinical symptoms," Anna Hielm-Bjorkman, who is Adjunct Professor at the University of Helsinki and spesialised in clinical research for companion animals, told Reuters."They are very good (at it). We come close to 100-percent sensitivity," she said, referring to the dogs's ability to detect cases of the virus.REUTERSTrainer Susanna Paavilainen with sniffer dog . In the canine test, a passenger swipes their neck with a gauze, places it in a can which is then handed over to another room for a dog to sniff and to deliver an immediate result.A few months ago, authorities in the United Arab Emirates embarked on similar canine testing at Dubai International Airport using police dogs."In the future, it's also possible... that these dogs go around passengers in a similar way to customs dogs," Vantaa deputy mayor Timo Aronkyto, said.

Your neighbour wants to build a large extension to the back of their home which could block the sunlight coming into your house. A housing developer wants to turn the playground your kids go to after school into a new estate. The council plans to build a new recycling centre just down the road from your home. Thankfully, none of these examples are real but they serve to illustrate just how important planning issues are to our daily lives. Any change in our local environment can have profound consequences for us, both good and bad, depending on your viewpoint. Some of us might welcome a new recycling centre down the road as it will be more convenient. Others may see the additional traffic as an unwelcome nuisance. But, whatever your view, the important principle in our current system is that you are made aware of the proposed changes before they get the green light. That way, the pros and cons can be debated openly, and everyone is given the opportunity to have their say. This commitment to transparency is underpinned by a longstanding obligation on councils to publish planning notices in local newspapers. In addition to using local papers, councils are free to publicise the notices through their own channels and on social media if they wish to do so. And, crucially, local authorities can work with local papers to use the reach of local newspapers' own digital channels. If you combine print and digital reach, local news brands now enjoy huge audiences - 40.6 million a month, according to JICREG. And that powerful reach and unique connection with local communities is at the disposal of councils when they need to communicate with the public. As an industry, we are very open to finding new and innovative ways for councils to communicate with the public. But we firmly believe that the obligation to publish public notices in printed local papers is critical to ensuring that councils and local papers work effectively together in this way. When it launched the 'Planning for the Future' consultation, the Government unveiled the most significant shake-up to the UK's planning system since the 1940s. A key part of this, according to the White Paper, will be to enhance democracy and transparency in the planning system; laudable objectives which we wholeheartedly support. But at least one measure in the consultation would do the exact opposite; the removal of the statutory requirement for councils to publicise planning notices in local newspapers. If this were to go ahead, we fear that the public access to important information would be severely impaired. Instead of being published in trusted local newspapers and across their digital channels, planning notices would be cast into the void of misinformation and fake news that is social media. Or they would placed in a little-visited part of a council website. And, what's more, those of you who prefer to get your news through a printed newspaper would never see the notices at all. As your local paper, we firmly believe in your right to know and we fight hard for it on your behalf every day of the week. In the digital era, we want to work with councils to find innovative new ways to help people find planning notices But removing the obligation to publish in print will damage that collaboration and lead to the notices being hidden from public view. If you believe in the public right to know, then please contact your MP and ask them to make representations to Government about this on your behalf. Your local newspaper stands for transparency and fights for your right to know every day. Now, you can help us defend these vital principles which underpin our democratic way of life. Yours sincerely, Anne Suslak, editor, the Herts Advertiser Write to your MP Daisy Cooper at daisy.cooper.mp@parliament.uk, or at Daisy Cooper, House of Commons, London, SW1A 0AA. Or for Harpenden write to Bim Afolami at bim.afolami.mp@parliament.uk, or at the House of Commons.

(AP) - A Massachusetts construction worker’s love of black licorice wound up costing him his life. Eating a bag and a half every day for a few weeks threw his nutrients out of whack and caused the 54-year-old man’s heart to stop, doctors reported Wednesday.“Even a small amount of licorice you eat can increase your blood pressure a little bit,” said Dr. Neel Butala, a cardiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital who described the case in the New England Journal of Medicine.The problem is glycyrrhizic acid, found in black licorice and in many other foods and dietary supplements containing licorice root extract. It can cause dangerously low potassium and imbalances in other minerals called electrolytes.Eating as little as 2 ounces of black licorice a day for two weeks could cause a heart rhythm problem, especially for folks over 40, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warns.“It’s more than licorice sticks. It could be jelly beans, licorice teas, a lot of things over the counter. Even some beers, like Belgian beers, have this compound in it,” as do some chewing tobaccos, said Dr. Robert Eckel, a University of Colorado cardiologist and former American Heart Association president. He had no role in the Massachusetts man’s care.The death was clearly an extreme case. The man had switched from red, fruit-flavored twists to the black licorice version of the candy a few weeks before his death last year. He collapsed while having lunch at a fast-food restaurant. Doctors found he had dangerously low potassium, which led to heart rhythm and other problems. Emergency responders did CPR and he revived but died the next day. The FDA permits up to 3.1% of a food’s content to have glycyrrhizic acid, but many candies and other licorice products don’t reveal how much of it is contained per ounce, Butala said. Doctors have reported the case to the FDA in hope of raising attention to the risk.Jeff Beckman, a spokesman for the Hershey Company, which makes the popular Twizzlers licorice twists, said in an email that “all of our products are safe to eat and formulated in full compliance with FDA regulations,” and that all foods, including candy, “should be enjoyed in moderation.” ___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

BEIJING (AP) — TikTok’s owner said Thursday it has applied for a Chinese technology export license as it tries to complete a deal with Oracle and Walmart to keep the popular video app operating in the United States.Beijing tightened control over technology exports last month in an effort to gain leverage over Washington’s attempt to force an outright sale of TikTok to U.S. owners. The White House says the video service is a security risk because the personal information of its millions of U.S. users could be handed over to Chinese authorities.President Donald Trump said this week he would approve a proposed deal in which Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc. could initially own a combined 20% of a new U.S. entity, TikTok Global. Trump said Oracle must have “total control.” ByteDance said it applied to the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce for an export license and was awaiting a reply. The one-sentence statement gave no other details.Chinese authorities have not indicated whether they will agree to a transfer of technology. But official newspapers criticized the proposed deal this week as bullying and extortion. “China has no reason to give the green light to such a deal, which is dirty and unfair,” said the newspaper China Daily on Wednesday. On Thursday, the foreign ministry said China will “take necessary measures” to safeguard its companies but gave no indication what steps it can take to affect TikTok’s fate in the United States. A ministry spokesman, Wang Wenbin, called on Washington to “respect the principles of market economy and fair competition” and “provide an open, fair, just and non-discriminatory business environment” for foreign companies.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

 “We like to be in well-established retail traffic patterns right next to our competitors because we outperform them,” he said. “The only worse thing than being next door to your competitor is not being next door to your competitor.”
 The vacant building was only on the market for a few days when he made the offer and closed on the building.
 “We’re a 100% real estate-owned company, so we own our stores,” Nicholson said.
 The total investment is $2.75 million for the new store, including $2.4 million for the building and another $350,000 for renovations, he said. The satellite store will open in late 2020 or early 2021.
 “The building is in really good shape … there won’t be a lot of modifications to it,” Nicholson said. “We’ll go in and redo the concrete, open it up, take everything out, paint it, make it pretty, clean, make sure everything is functional and pack it full of appliances.”
 Nicholson started East Coast Appliance in 1988 as a small appliance retail sales and service operation with less than 3,500 square feet in Virginia Beach. It expanded in a warehouse format to six locations, including two in Virginia Beach, one each in Chesapeake, Fredericksburg, Newport News, and Norfolk.
 Store showrooms display several hundred appliances at any given time, with roughly 40% new merchandise and 60% ready-to-go and new scratched and dented machines.

On Friday, it will be a year since the flash floods struck the city on September 25, but the victims who are still picking up pieces of life have not been able to stabilise themselves. The flash floods of 2019 claimed 26 lives in Pune. For residents of Tangewala colony in Sahakarnagar, the flash floods were a nightmare as seven people from the colony lost their lives.Fears of flooding were back among residents with the city witnessing heavy rainfall over the past few days. With the rising water levels in the area, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) sent a notice on September 13 to all the 85 houses of the colony to evacuate the premises.So far the Pune district has received 154.9 mm of rain, 56.2 mm more than the normal average (98.7mm).However, the residents say since the flash floods, nothing has improved in the area. "We are living under constant fear over the last two weeks as the water level has climbed up high and at night we had to run out of our houses. As we don't have any other option, we have to stay here. The government and PMC had promised us that they will give us new houses and also build a safety retaining wall near Ambil Odha, but nothing has happened over the past year and we are staring at floods again," said Sunil Shinde, a resident of Tangewala colony. Tangewala colony is located behind Gangatirtha society in Sahakarnagar. There is a canal located behind the society and it has 125 slums in close proximity to each other. Rahul Raut/HT PHOTOThe Ambil Odha (stream) saw a rise in water level after heavy rainfall in the city over the weekend. The PMC sent a notice on September 13 to all 85 houses of the colony to evacuate.Last year the flash floods occurred right before the state assembly elections and all political parties tried to take advantage of the situation by dolling out lofty promises to the residents of the area, including giving them compensation, repairing and restoring the Ambil Odha, among others. However, on ground, things remain the same. The Pune Municipal Corporation and district collectorate helped the flood victims by giving them compensation. The PMC also allotted Rs 300 crore for the repair of the Ambil Odha, which is yet to be completed. Another resident Nanda Kailash Shinde, whose entire house collapsed in the flash floods, said, "Our entire house was damaged in the floods and we had to rebuilt it. It cost us Rs 2.5 lakh. Also, all our important documents were damaged due to the water and we have not been able to get any help from the PMC or the state government. We are worried about the future of our children and so, PMC should at least give us proper homes for safety." PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar, said, "We are taking all the necessary measures for the safety of citizens who had been affected due to flash floods last year. I have personally visited the areas over the past week. We are currently working on their rehabilitation project."Revisiting the horrorOne hundred mm of rain in two hours in September 2019 set the Ambil Odha up to burst its banks and overflow. 2.5 lakh- People affected by floods and 800 animals killed, including cattle in local dairies. Also, 2,700- Vehicles on the roads and parking lots were found submerged in the waterlogged areas of south Pune in localities such as Katraj, Bibvewadi, Padmavati and Sahakarnagar.What was promised- On ground situationA private firm surveyed the stream and identified 77 illegal structures along the stream which aggravated the floods- Illegal structures still stand. Spend Rs 300 crore on building retaining wall along Ambil odha and repair sections where the bank and barriers had collapsed- Work on the retaining wall hasn't begun

The Topix index of all TSE first-section issues closed down 17.81 points, or 1.08 percent, at 1,626.44, after a 2.17-point drop the previous day.
 Disheartened by falls in all three major U.S. stock price gauges Wednesday, investors moved to sell stocks from the opening bell of Thursday's trading on the TSE.
 The U.S. market tumble came as hopes for a recovery in the U.S. economy receded due to the lower-than-expected U.S. service sector purchasing managers index for September, released by British financial data provider IHS Markit, brokers said.
 They also cited U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell expressing concern over economic uncertainties amid the novel coronavirus crisis, and pointing to the need for a new stimulus package.
 The Nikkei showed some resilience after sinking nearly 250 points shortly after the opening, but fell deeper into negative territory in the afternoon to temporarily shed over 300 points.
 The dive came on the heels of falls in the Chinese stock market, as well as U.S. Dow Jones industrial average futures in off-hours trading, market sources said.
 "Investor sentiment was hurt by stalled talks in the United States over a fresh coronavirus relief package," Yutaka Miura, senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities Co., noted.
 Meanwhile, the Tokyo market's resilience in early trading came on the back of expectations for purchases of exchange-traded funds by the Bank of Japan, he said.
 On the TSE first section, falling issues overwhelmed rising ones 1,685 to 419, while 72 issues were unchanged.
 First-section volume decreased to 1.25 billion shares from Wednesday's 1.52 billion.
 Automaker Toyota, electronic device maker Nidec and other export-oriented issues succumbed to heavy selling, reflecting uncertainties over the world economy amid growing novel coronavirus cases in Europe and the stalemated virus stimulus talks in the United States.
 Job information provider Recruit Holdings and medical information company M3 were also out of favor.
 On the other hand, clothing retailer Shimamura jumped 5.25 percent, thanks to its rosy preliminary sales data for September.
 Among other major winners were food producer Meiji Holdings and parcel delivery firm Yamato Holdings.
 In index futures trading on the Osaka Exchange, the key December contract on the Nikkei fell 270 points to 22,920.

Torino will not give up their chase of Arsenal midfielder, Lucas Torreira despite strong interest from Atletico Madrid, this is what Sport Italia and Calciomercato via Mail Online is reporting.
 The Uruguayan midfielder will be allowed to leave Arsenal this summer after falling down the pecking order at the Emirates.
 He appeared to be set for a return to the Italian Serie A this season, but Atletico Madrid has now entered the race for his signature.
 Torino had beaten competition from Fiorentina to close in on a season-long loan deal for the former Sampdoria man.
 But the interest in him from Atletico changes things, yet the Italians won’t give up.
 The report claims that Torino is still confident that he will join them this summer and that the Italians have even sent a contingent to London to broker a deal with Arsenal.
 He is expected to join them on-loan with an obligation to buy at the end of the season.
 It remains unclear if Torreira will prefer a reunion with his former manager, Marco Giampaolo to turning out for Atletico in the Champions League.
 A reunion was all that was in his mind, but now that he has the chance to play Champions League football, that might change his preference.

 RPA refers to the use of software to automate repeated manual tasks like payroll processing, onboarding of employees and processing orders.
 According to a study by Forrester Consulting, commissioned by RPA player UiPath, companies are likely to increase their RPA spend by 5 percent in the next 12 months. Market research firm IDC in a report said that the pandemic has put RPA in the spotlight as companies are realizing the role of RPA in business continuity as they move into the economic recovery phase.

Here are 5 things to know about Saturday night's game between N.C. State (1-0, 1-0) and Virginia Tech (0-0, 0-0) in Blacksburg, Va.
   
 Hokie Who's Who
   
 Due to COVID-19 issues, Virginia Tech's rivalry game against Virginia being postponed Sept. 12, it's uncertain just which players will be able to suit up for the Hokies against N.C. State.
   
 Virginia Tech coach Justin Fuentes said Monday "We will not have a full roster,'' against the Wolfpack. The Hokies were already short-handed in the defensive secondary with All American cornerback Caleb Farley opting not to play this season due to the COVID-19 threat and starting safety Devon Hunter suspended while facing a felony charge over a dispute with a family member.
   
 The uncertainty about who will be in Virginia Tech's lineup is just another challenge the Wolfpack must overcome.
   
 "We know their personnel,'' N.C. State coach Dave Doeren said. "We just don't know who's going to play with what they've been dealing with. We're just going to have to feel that out once we get into the game.''
   
 Running with the Pack
   
 N.C. State literally shot out of the gate in the opener against Wake Forest with runs of 33 and 30 yards in its first five plays from scrimmage with the latter being a touchdown jaunt by Zonovan Knight. The Wolfpack would rack up 270 yards on 49 rushes in the game and score four times in a dramatic display of improvement over last year's ground attack (151.2 average, 14 touchdowns on the year).
   
 Ricky Person (97 yards on 14 rushes), Knight (11-97) and Jordan Houston (12-54) combined for eight runs of 10 or more yards, and seven of those went for 20 or better.
   
 Of course, the challenge will be greater for N.C. State's run game Saturday against a Virginia Tech defense returning eight starters from a unit that was fifth-best against the run a year ago (139.3).
   
 Virginia Tech's N.C. presence
   
 The Hokies feature 15 players who attended North Carolina high schools on their 2020 roster and eight of those are included on the depth chart for the N.C. State game.
   
 Quarterback Hendon Hooker (Greensboro Dudley), wide receiver Tre Turner (Northwest Guilford), center Brock Hoffman (Statesville), linebacker Dax Hollifield (Shelby) and free safety Divine Deablo (Mount Tabor) are projected as starters, while defensive end Zion DeBose (North Rowan), linebacker Alan Tisdale (Greensboro Page) and nickel back J.R. Walker (Clayton) are top backups.
   
 Local knowledge
   
 Although N.C. State hasn't had the benefit of reviewing game film from this season of Virginia Tech, the Wolfpack does have some inside knowledge of the Hokes' personnel.
   
 Defensive line coach Charley Wiles and cornerback coach Brian Mitchell both were previously members of the staff at Virginia Tech under current coach Justin Fuentes. Wiles spent the past 24 seasons at Tech under both Fuentes and Hall of Fame coach Frank Beamer, while Mitchell worked there under Fuentes from 2016-19.
   
 Mitchell and Wiley could provide some much needed scouting on the Hokies, whom N.C. State hasn't faced since 2015.
   
 "With Charlie and Brian coming from there, you know things about their players,'' N.C. State head coach Dave Doeren said. "The tough part is we don't know which personnel will be out there.''
   
 Unlucky in Lane
   
 The Wolfpack hasn't enjoyed much success in games played at Virginia Tech's Lane Stadium. The Hokies own a 9-2-2 advantage against N.C. State on their home field. The Wolfpack's last victory in Lane occurred during the 2004 season, when sparked by a defense that produced 10 quarterback sacks, won a 17-16 decision. Tech kicker Brandon Pace missed a 43-yard field goal on the game's final play in a dramatic finish.

India’s biggest oil refiner is betting on plastics as it seeks to diversify from an increasingly challenging fuels business.
 Indian Oil Corporation plans to add petrochemical plants to all of its future refinery expansions and boost existing output at its current facilities, Chairman Shrikant Madhav Vaidya said. Overall, less than 10 per cent of the crude processed by the refiner is used to make petrochemicals — the building blocks for everything from food packaging to car parts — but the business contributes almost a quarter of the company’s profits, he added.
 While there is consumer and government pressure across the world to reduce the use of plastics, processors in Asia are building or planning petrochemical plants, with demand for transport fuels set to ease in the years ahead. Indian Oil this week finalised a $2.4-billion expansion at its Gujarat refinery to include a polypropylene unit, which can make products for packaging and textiles.
 “We realised that the volatility of the fuel market can be easily controlled by having a good footprint in the petrochemicals sector,” Vaidya said in an interview. “Petroleum fuels continue to be my main business as far as turnover is concerned, but profitability I intend to get from petrochemicals.”
 Indian Oil, which operates nine refineries, saw its profit tumble more than 90 per cent in the year ended March 31 as volatility in oil and product prices led to narrow or negative margins. Overall, the company plans to double the amount of crude processed at its refineries to make petrochemicals. At major plants Panipat, Paradip and Gujarat, the proportion of oil processed to produce petrochemicals is expected to climb to 25 per cent, from 15-20 per cent currently, Vaidya said.
 Vaidya, however, is optimistic about India’s demand growth outlook for petroleum fuels and future investments in the sector. In the short term, he sees consumption reaching pre-virus levels as early as year-end, allowing the refiner to boost processing rates to 90-100 per cent, from about 75 per cent now. Fuel stockpiles have also eased closer to a more typical level that’s sufficient enough to meet two weeks of demand, he said.
 Indian Oil, which controls 40 per cent of the nation’s petroleum fuels market, also plans to expand into natural gas and renewable energy. “We have every intention of becoming an energy company, not just restricted to fossil fuels,” Vaidya said.

DIVÍN. Divínčanka Petra Šuleková sa stala majsterkou Slovenska. Čoskoro osemnásťročná atlétka, behajúca vo farbách ŠK ŠOG Nitra, sa blysla na národnom šampionáte do 23 rokov v Bratislave. Zlato a titul si uchmatla v disciplíne 3 km cez prekážky.
 „Na dráhe sme boli len štyri. Pod nižší počet sa podpísala aj koronakríza, no 3 km cez prekážky nepatria k ľahkým disciplínam, takže svoju úlohu zohrala aj náročnosť. Konkurencia však bola silná. Súperila som aj s atlétkou, ktorá súťažila na osemstovke na majstrovstvách Európy,“ zhrnula odchovankyňa lučeneckého MAC Redox, ktorá bola s výkonom, časom aj nastavenou taktikou spokojná.

A boundary exists between the lower, creeping part of the fault, and the upper portion that may stand locked for centuries at a stretch. For decades, scientists have puzzled over what controls this boundary, its movements and its relationship with big earthquakes. Chief among the unknowns is how fluid and pressure migrate along faults, and how that causes faults to slip.

"First off on Mullens, one thing he does an extremely good job of is you can spread the field out with him," Judge said. "He gets the ball out of his hand extremely fast. He’s a guy who turns two, as we say. The ball hits his hand, ball is coming out and he’s getting it to the receiver. He has very good anticipation, he does a good job pre-snap really reading the defense, knowing where his receivers are going to be. He’s a tough, gritty dude."

In the canine test, a passenger swipes their neck with a gauze, places it in a can which is then handed over to another room for a dog to sniff and to deliver an immediate result.
 A few months ago, authorities in the United Arab Emirates embarked on similar canine testing at Dubai International Airport using police dogs.
 "In the future, it's also possible... that these dogs go around passengers in a similar way to customs dogs," Vantaa deputy mayor Timo Aronkyto, said. (Reporting by Anne Kauranen and Attila Cser Editing by Alexandra Hudson)

The global energy market is on the brink of a major transition to cleaner sources of energy. To adjust and transform, the world’s largest oil and gas firms are revising their long-term oil price and demand outlook, and need to streamline their portfolios significantly to improve cash flow, cost efficiency and competitiveness. As a result, several billions of dollars in assets are about to change hands.
 A Rystad Energy study of the geographical spread of ExxonMobil, BP, Shell, Total, Eni, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Equinor – which we call “Majors+” – reveals that to adjust to the energy transition, the eight companies may need to divest combined resources of up to 68 billion barrels of oil equivalent, with an estimated value of $111 billion and spending commitments in 2021 totaling $20 billion.
 Our key criteria for determining whether a Major+ would benefit from staying in a country are the company’s cash flow over the next five years, the potential growth in its current portfolio, and its presence in key E&P growth countries towards 2030. Based on this we see that the Majors+ may seek to exit 203 country positions and as a result reduce their number of country positions from 293 to 90.
 “Companies will look to expand in the prioritized countries through exploration, acquisitions or asset swaps with other Major+ players. However, to stay in a country that our criteria exclude, a company may instead seek to grow its local business more aggressively to make sure the portfolio will have a positive and more significant impact on overall performance,“ says Rystad Energy’s Senior Vice President Tore Guldbrandsoy.
 Based on our criteria, we see that the Majors+ altogether need to exit 203 country positions in 60 countries. The remaining countries after the screening vary from six to 16 countries per company.
 Rystad Energy’s study shows that all the Majors+ companies are likely to keep a presence in the US, and most of them may also remain in Australia and Canada. On the other end of the scale we see quite a few countries with only one oil major present, including Argentina (BP), Ghana (Eni), Thailand (Chevron) and Guyana (ExxonMobil). In some of these countries it could be tempting for others to stay or increase their presence as the competition may be more limited. At the same time, these countries could also be growth targets for other companies than the Majors+.
 The results of the study, which are not fully disclosed in this press release, indicate a number of potential deals among Major+ players buying portfolios from each other to boost their position in a key country.
