Burns faces a surprise challenge from reinvented opener Will Pucovski who was unbeaten on 255 when Victoria declared on 3-564 against South Australia at Glenelg Oval. With 256 runs at 32 last summer, Burns failed to cement his spot in a Test side that swept the Pakistan and New Zealand series 5-0. He batted through a tough first session on Friday but wasted the start to fall for 29. Going on past experience, the selectors don’t need much of an excuse to drop Burns, as he was overlooked for the 2019 Ashes after making 180 against Sri Lanka in Canberra. With Marcus Harris also pressing, Burns needs a score in the final round of the opening block of Shield games next week. Fortunately for him, Queensland is playing the listless Redbacks. Bar the reliable Chadd Sayers, the South Australian attack is a friendlier prospect than the NSW outfit that ran through Queensland’s top order on Sunday. Trent Copeland trundled out the most extraordinary spell of the Shield thus far this summer, bowling 66 consecutive dot balls in his 5-17 from 18 overs (12 maidens). Copeland found Burns’ outside edge on his way to 3-2 from 10 overs (nine maidens) before lunch. The Blues turned up the volume when first-innings hundred-maker Marnus Labuschagne strode out, with Nathan Lyon appearing to mark out a small, imaginary, circle on a good length as if to say `that’s where Trent’s going to bowl it’. Well Lyon was spot on, as Copeland hit the perfect length to get Labuschagne lbw for a duck, triggering a rowdy send-off for the Australian No 3. When Bryce Street feathered Copeland to keeper Peter Nevill the Bulls were in deep trouble at 3-30. Usman Khawaja (41) and Matt Renshaw (42) defied NSW for a time until Copeland returned to dismiss both Bulls left-handers. Kurtis Patterson clutched a one-handed screamer at second slip to end Renshaw’s 115-ball vigil. Copeland had 5-6 before his figures blew out to a profligate 5-17. “I was talking to the lads just before in the sheds and I can’t recall a time when things have gone better, or to a plan, as well as that today,” Copeland said after play. “Today was one of those days where I felt like I had the ball in my control and it was doing what I wanted it to do. “It was a wicket that offered that half bat width – it wasn’t doing so much that it was beating the bat. “It was my day today but the whole bowling unit was really good.” Lusty hitting – including two big sixes — by Mark Steketee (27 from 24) helped edge the Bulls total to 190, leaving NSW 206 to win. At stumps the Blues were 3-71, with Daniel Hughes on 24 and Daniel Solway 17. Fresh from taking 5-97 in the first innings, his best first-class return, leg-spinner Mitchell Swepson landed a heavy blow when he dismissed a sweeping Moises Henriques lbw late in the day.

Friedner said that as the number of homes on the market keep dropping, more people are turning to land to build on, including developments like Northern Lights on Big Mountain. Because there can be a lag between purchasing a property and beginning construction, it can be hard to gauge just how many people are starting from scratch this year, said Whitefish Planning and Building Director Dave Taylor. He added that he’s fielded multiple calls in recent months from out-of-state developers looking to build in Whitefish.
 Much of the fuel in the real estate market appears to be coming from out-of- staters interested in moving to Montana due to the pandemic. Friedner said she’s been dealing with many clients from Texas, California, Washington and Minnesota. Earlier this year, real estate agents reported out-of-state buyers making offers on homes after having seen the properties only via a virtual FaceTime tour.
 Data released this week by the Oregon Office of Economic Analysis shows that a similar story is unfolding across the West in so-called Zoom towns — smaller- population scenic areas where residents can telecommute to jobs in distant cities. Among them are places like Missoula, where home sales have increased nearly 10% over last year.
 Even in more remote areas, real estate is moving quickly this year. Tina Morkert, a broker in Thompson Falls, said there is little inventory available in Sanders County right now following a busier-than-normal summer. For years, no-stoplight towns like Thompson Falls (population 1,394 as of 2018) have remained essentially unchanged, Morkert said, even as Kalispell and Missoula have rapidly grown. But she said Thompson Falls felt busier than ever this summer.
 “If this continues we’re going to need a stoplight,” she said.

If you order food from your car, you might expect only a certain quality of taste and presentation. But the Chef Lamona food truck is trying to change that expectation by offering "fine dining in a truck," according to owner Lamona Scroggins.
   
 Not only does Scroggins love to cook, she hopes to express love through her cooking. She believes that is her way of blessing her friends and family, and she wants to bless the entire Topeka community through her new business, which serves her "gourmet comfort food," she said.
   
 After watching both her parents take great pride in their own cooking, Scroggins started developing her own style in the kitchen at age 18. She honed her skills as a personal chef, cooking gourmet meals for personal parties and events.
   
 "I've always loved the art of cooking," Scroggins said. "I never really wanted to own a truck or a restaurant. I just loved cooking for people. So it made sense being a personal chef. But that's a luxury that not everyone can afford."
   
 News of her cooking spread by word of mouth, which prompted interest in offering her food to the public. But Scroggins was hesitant to make the leap. Finally, persuaded by the prodding of her family and friends, Scroggins joined forces with business partner Nicole Malone, and "fine dining in a truck" became a reality on Sept. 26.
   
 Scroggins and Malone had no desire to cram common food into a paper bag. They were committed as much to the style and presentation of the food as they were the taste. That meant they would have to oversee every detail and cast their vision to every employee. For that reason, the food truck has opened on a limited scale at first. For the time being, it is only open for business on Wednesdays and Saturdays for lunch and dinner.
   
 "I want it to taste and look a certain way," Scroggins said. "I want it to have that same quality that I put into when I was a personal chef.
   
 "I've never done business like this. You need a lot of staff. So we picked our days strategically at first."
   
 Scroggins demands the same standard of quality every day, but don't expect the same items on the menu. She said she plans to change the offerings every couple of weeks to keep things fresh.
   
 That's just who I am," Scroggins said. "When I switch the menu up, no one complains. I think they like that. I'm just being me. I try to structure the menu as if you were eating in my home."
   
 Items you might find on the menu include gumbo and beignets, or ham and beans with corn bread, or oxtail soup, or any other of a countless number of offerings she dreams up.
   
 "I have already been getting requests to bring back things that we've taken off the menu," Scroggins said.
   
 The Chef Lamona food truck developed a drive-thru process that enables customers to order and pick up their food without exiting their vehicles. Scroggins said she hopes that feature will be increasingly popular in cold weather. She said the business will try various locations, but the primary spot will be the parking lot of Harbor Freight Tools, 230 S.E. 29th St., due to the ample space it provides.
   
 Scroggins said working in a truck requires that she economize the space. She doesn't rule out opening a traditional restaurant someday. But for now, she said, she and Malone are dedicated to the food truck venture.
   
 "The challenges of working out of a food truck are that you need certain things to make it work," Scroggins said. "I like the truck experience over having to keep up a building. You never know where this might lead eventually, but right now I just like the feel of what we're doing.
   
 "I'm doing this for the satisfaction of people enjoying the quality of my food, the love I put into my food. Money is nice, but I had a good job before this. I'm getting a different kind of satisfaction out of doing this."

FAYETTEVILLE -- Even in this age of passing prolific Spread offenses and defenses designed to stop them, effectively running the ball and stopping the run remains the tried and true football formula most in vogue.
   
 That formula indicates the Arkansas Razorbacks running into trouble against the nationally No. 8 Texas A&M; Aggies.
   
 Each coming off a bye week, first-year Head Coach Sam Pittman's Razorbacks, 2-2, and Coach Jimbo Fisher's Aggies, 3-1, clash in today night's 6:30 SEC West game televised by the SEC Network at A&M;'s Kyle Field in College Station, Texas.
   
 Only an egregious officiating error depriving Arkansas of a fumble recovery and running out the clock up 28-27 instead of Auburn kicking 30-28 game- winning field goal with seven seconds left prevents the Razorbacks from rolling 3-1 with a 3-game winning streak.
   
 Nevertheless their SEC surge under new Coach Pittman after consecutive 0-8 SEC campaigns during the 2018 and 2019 Chad Morris regimes is tempered by what they run into at Kyle Field.
   
 Other than Georgia, a 37-10 victor over Arkansas in the Sept. 26 season opener, no SEC team stops the run better than the Aggies allowing but 75 yards rushing per game.
   
 Other than forget the run Air Raid Mississippi State, no SEC team runs for less than Arkansas' 102 yards per game.
   
 Conversely, A&M; ranks second in the SEC averaging 172 rushing yards.
   
 Offensively, A&M; running back Isaiah Spiller in three games out of four has outrushed Arkansas' team average per game. Spiller peaked 174 and two touchdowns on 27 carries in the Fisher era's signature win, 41-38 over then No. 4 Florida on Oct. 10. Spiller followed netting 114 and two touchdowns on 18 carries beating Mississippi State, 28-14.
   
 "Isaiah Spiller is really good and playing exceptional," Pittman said.
   
 Arkansas senior middle linebacker Grant Morgan of Greenwood calls Spiller, "probably the best back we've faced all year. He runs super hard. He hits the gaps. He has the best vision we've seen."
   
 A&M; sports perhaps the best offensive line these Hogs have seen.
   
 And most physical, Pittman said.
   
 As for A&M;'s quarterback, Pittman says it seems "Kellen Mond being there forever."
   
 Tell Arkansas about it. Since joining the SEC, the Aggies are 8-0 in their annual SEC West game with Arkansas. Senior dual threat quarterback Mond started winning the last three as a true freshman starter over Bret Bielema's 2017 Razorbacks.
   
 Back from old Arkansas vs. Texas A&M; Southwest Conference days the Aggies defensively inevitably fielded defenses big, fast and mean.
   
 These Aggies fit their mold.
   
 "Their D-line,"Pittman said. "Bobby Brown is a guy that sticks out and Buddy Johnson. Their secondary is very, very physical. Safeties that will come down and flat hit you. And they are very good at corner. Just a really solid football team that's ranked in the Top Ten and should be."
   
 Fisher, a former national champion coach at Florida State, praises Arkansas in all phases.
   
 Particularly if the Barry Odom coordinated Arkansas defense stops the run and forces Mond having to pass instead of choosing to pass.
   
 Arkansas' 10 interceptions lead the SEC. And the Hogs both run the ball and stop the run better than stats show, Fisher implied.
   
 "They're generating tons of turnovers on defense," Fisher said. "They've had goal-line stands on the 1-yard line twice I know in the Ole Miss game."
   
 Fisher said the Hogs have "run the ball solidly. They're not averaging tons of yards but they make you play the run."
   
 That opens up the passing game for Arkansas' been around the SEC forever quarterback. Graduate transfer Feleipe Franks is four games new to Arkansas but started at Florida from 2017 through his third game of the season-ending injury in 2019.
   
 "Feleipe's a big, (6-6, 228) strong guy who's playing really good football," Fisher said. "Eight touchdowns, 3 picks, high percentage of completions, can get the ball to any part of the field at any time."
   
 Fisher knows with Rakeem Boyd, an Aggie freshman in 2016 transferred to junior college and since 2018 Arkansas' leading rusher, is one back away from greatness.
   
 Boyd' rushed 1,133 yards last year. He's been injury hampered this year but has had two weeks to heal.
   
 "I mean Boyd is a big, strong guy, physical, runs hard, runs through people," Fisher said.
   
 Boyd popped 25 and 24 yard runs the last two years against A&M; on a combined 28 carries for 136 yards.
   
 A&M;'s 8-0 hold on Arkansas has not recently come easily. Even Morris' abysmal teams battled A&M; to the wire in 24-17 and 31-27 losses in 2018 and 2019 and in 2017 required two overtimes to outlast 50-43 Bielema's 2017 Razorbacks wallowed 1-7 in the SEC.
   
 Both teams exhibit major improvements since 2019.

On the first attempt, Iowa managed to cross midfield, but three straight Petras incompletions led to a turnover on downs. On the second, senior linebacker Blake Gallagher intercepted Petras with a minute remaining to ice the victory.

One of Topeka's newest food ventures is shrouded in secrecy.
   
 Ghost Peppers, a delivery-only food service that begins its operations Nov. 2, won't only bring unique flavor combinations to Topeka but will be the city's first ghost kitchen.
   
 Ordering food from Ghost Peppers is available by visiting ghostpepperstopeka.com.
   
 According to Pedro Concepcion, founder of Kit Solutions Group and creator of Ghost Peppers, the ghost restaurant will serve fajitas, but not in a traditional sense.
   
 "It's kind of a combination of Hispanic with American," Concepcion said. "When you see regular fajitas in a Mexican restaurant, it's a bunch of peppers with meat. We are kind of doing it the same way, but our meats are smoked and then you can have a combination of brisket, burnt ends, pulled pork."
   
 Customers will also have the option to add peppers, corn and homemade sauces.
   
 While this will be Topeka's first ghost kitchen, the concept isn't new. In fact, it is a model that has been growing in popularity in recent years, with such chain restaurants as Chili's jumping on board with its "It's Just Wings" ghost restaurant.
   
 But what kicked the concept into high gear was the COVID-19 pandemic. Restaurants throughout the country closed their dining rooms, making it difficult for them to remain open, and subsequently, many restaurants closed their doors permanently.
   
 Because a ghost kitchen is delivery-only, restaurants that adapt to the model can remain open and bring in a steady stream of revenue.
   
 While the economic struggles brought on by the global pandemic won't last forever, there is a good chance ghost kitchens will.
   
 According to restaurantbusinessonline.com and Technomic, "sales via ghost restaurants from 300 facilities in the United States will rise by a projected 25% each year for the next 5 years -- an estimated $300 million in yearly sales. For this reason, operators would likely benefit by investing in the ghost kitchen model long-term."
   
 Not only do ghost kitchens operate as a delivery-only service, the kitchen where they prepare their food typically remains a mystery to the customer.
   
 Only those privy to Ghost Peppers' creation, such as Pedro and Javier Concepcion, know the location of where the menu items will be created.
   
 But rest assured, Concepcion says, it is coming from a reputable kitchen in Topeka.
   
 "It's already established, it's already licensed, so there's no worry that it's coming out of my garage," Concepcion said.
   
 One of the reasons the location of ghost kitchens remains a secret is to allow restaurants to experiment with new concepts without tarnishing their identity.
   
 The idea behind a ghost kitchen is to not only bring a new restaurant model to a city, but also to assist restaurants that might be struggling to bring in revenue.
   
 "Right now, restaurants are not seeing the volume they were seeing before, so it kind of has a trickle effect," Concepcion said. "When a restaurant doesn't have sales, it cuts its staff. So some restaurants right now are trying to figure out how to keep their staff still working."
   
 A ghost kitchen allows a restaurant to create a second, delivery-only menu within their kitchen. In order for a ghost kitchen to be successful, using products and resources they already have is vital.
   
 For example, Concepcion said, he wouldn't recommend that a vegetarian restaurant open a pizza ghost kitchen.
   
 "To make it logistically sound, I would recommend to look at their own resources and what they have," Concepcion said. "The way we are building them is you have to use your resources for them so it doesn't cost them so much money. A lot of people will tell you, 'Another menu, more money, more items you have to carry' -- not necessarily. Not if you look at your pantry and your walk-in and say, 'I can grab this, grab that,' and create a completely different concept that looks so different than what you have right now."
   
 And if a restaurant's ghost kitchen concept fails, it isn't a huge loss, Concepcion said.
   
 "All they have to do is turn off the website, turn off the Facebook," Concepcion said. "All their product is still there, all the labor they use they were already using so it doesn't really hurt them. It's just to give more options and honestly, find a way for them to stay afloat."
   
 If the concept ends up being successful in Topeka, Concepcion said, he hopes to incorporate several more ghost kitchens in established restaurants.
   
 While no other concepts have been set in stone, Concepcion is throwing around the idea of a ramen ghost kitchen.
   
 Concepcion said he hopes Ghost Peppers allows Topekans to experience quality food delivered to their door.
   
 "There's this notion that your delivery food is going to suck," Concepcion said. "For the most part, most of these restaurants weren't built for delivery. If you have a burger place, it's kind of hard almost because by the time your fries get home, they are kind of soggy, the bun is kind of greasy and it is what it is. Same thing if you were doing tacos. It has to make sense. We are trying to do it right. We are trying to think of the delivery aspect of it to the food presentation to how it tastes."

Man-made snow is coming back to the Sunset Hills cross country ski trails in Bozeman.
 The open space between Bozeman Health Deaconess Hospital, the softball fields, and the cemetery has long been a popular cross country skiing location. With the early season snow last weekend, skiers could be seen gliding over the hills this week.
 But even if this winter is a low-snow year, Bridger Ski Foundation expects skiing to be available from late fall to early spring with the installation of a snow-making system.

But this seems unlikely for the time being, considering the only party openly advocating the liberalization of LGBT rights (Progressive Slovakia) is not even represented at the political level. A more likely development is the politicization of the issue during the current legislature - be it at the initiative of a ruling or opposition party - which would not necessarily lead to an improvement of LGBT rights, quite the contrary.

In a recent board meeting, I was asked by a Trustee, “Is there any item that has been discussed today that can’t be delivered due to technology?” After some thought, my answer was an emphatic, “No!” Of course, I qualified my answer with, “We can develop all of these ideas and increase the ‘Wow’ of each of these projects exponentially. However, none of the delivery mechanisms (technology) will mean anything without content!”
 I’ve seen a number projects utilizing incredible technology delivery methods fall flat - they do not meet the expectations of the creators. More often than not, it’s not actually the technology that has failed. It’s the fact that an immense amount of effort was put into the technology without an at least equal amount of effort being put into developing the content to be delivered by the technology that constitutes a failure.
 What makes a website successful? What makes a good exhibit? What makes electronic signage effective? The content. If users of a website don’t find the content they are looking for, the bells and whistles will not be enough to keep them on your site and, more importantly, keep them coming back. The learning experience of the exhibit is why the majority of visitors show up to see your exhibit - not the delivery mechanism. People stop to read electronic signage to receive your message (aka get information) not because it has flashy lights. Sure, the sizzle and pop of these delivery mechanisms grab their attention and get them to stop, but what keeps them there? What makes it worth their while to stop? The content!
 When working with clients (internal or external), I stress this - “Content is King!” If a client is asking for a particular technology, I immediately ask, “What results are you hoping to get? What do you want your viewers/customers to walk away with?” Make sure the content is well thought out.
 Just as important, make sure there is a Content Development Plan in place. A lot of projects come out of the gate with awesome content but lose steam as time passes. A consistent and deliverable content plan is a must. This plan should have a timeline, a responsibility matrix, a budget, etc. Developing content is not easy - it takes a plan, dedication and resources.
 The combination of solid content and good implementation of technology can do wonders for any type of business or project. One without the other will likely fail and not give your clients the results they are expecting. Technology is often blamed for the failure of projects (sometimes justifiably so), but don’t let your technology take the rap for a lack of content.
 Technology is only the knight in the fight for our visitors. Content is King.

TUSCALOOSA, Ala. — It was Halloween inside Bryant-Denny Stadium on Saturday night. Alabama's defense came as its old self.
 The No. 2 Crimson Tide recorded its first shutout since 2018, easing past Mississippi State 41-0.
 Led by Mike Leach’s Air Raid offense, the Bulldogs came into Tuscaloosa ranked No. 5 in the nation averaging 357.5 yards per game through the air. Alabama allowed less than half of that, holding Mississippi State to a season-low 163 passing yards while limiting the Bulldogs to just 3.2 yards per play.
 That’s quite the change from when Alabama allowed 7.5 yards per play while giving up an embarrassing 647 yards in a 63-48 victory over Ole Miss earlier this month.
 “I think that kind of made them mad,” Alabama receiver DeVonta Smith said of his defense. “Everybody outside was criticizing them. They kind of was feeding off of that. They was like ‘OK, if y’all are going to talk we’re going to show y’all.' I feel like everybody talking down about them made them hungry… I knew that everybody saying the things they said would make them mad, just wake up the monster.”
 Alabama’s defense set the tone early, forcing three-and-outs on each of Mississippi State’s first three possessions. The Bulldogs didn’t record a first down until 9:34 left in the second quarter and moved the chains just once in the first half, entering the break with just 38 yards of total offense. Mississippi State ended the night with 200 yards to its name, punting 10 times while going 2 of 15 on third down.
 Since the second half of its 41-24 victory over Georgia, Alabama’s defense has allowed just 17 points over 10 quarters of play, a stark contrast to the average of 30.33 points allowed over its first three games. While defensive coordinator Pete Golding might not have completely earned back the trust of the Tide faithful just yet, his defense is finally performing to the level of a championship contender.
 “This gives us a lot of a lot of confidence going into the weeks ahead,” cornerback Patrick Surtain II said. “We planned on doing what we needed to do to stop their Air Raid attack, and we went into the whole week knowing this is what we needed to do to control that. I feel like carrying this momentum into the weeks ahead will give us a slight advantage.”
 Surtain recorded Alabama’ third non-offensive touchdown of the season when he returned an interception 25 yards for a score in the fourth quarter. The play marked Alabama’s second defensive touchdown in as many weeks as freshman Malachi Moore found the end zone on a 28-yard strip-and-score against Tennessee.
 “I disguised because I knew they ran that concept before earlier in the game, so I recognized the play before it happened,” Surtain said of his interception return. “I jumped it and caught the ball. I knew it was a house call.”
 Alabama came well-prepared to stop the Air Raid, focusing on getting to the ball and tackling in open space. Mississippi State ran the ball just 15 times for 37 yards, opting instead to spray out passes to its receivers. Following the game, Nick Saban said his team researched Leach’s offenses at Wahington State last year piecing together how to best defend the unique attack.
 “I think it’s a positive sign that the players were able to do the things that were a little different and go out there and execute them well enough against a pretty prolific passing team,” Saban said. “I don’t think they expected us to play the way we played, so that probably was a positive for us. … But the way we played the game today is you’re begging them to run the ball, basically. I don’t think you can play that way against most teams, but I think the confidence that the players gained from going out there and getting the shutout in this day and age is a real positive thing for the defense.”
 Alabama has an open date on its schedule next week before traveling to Baton Rouge, La., to take on defending national champions LSU on Nov. 14.
 Despite Saturday’s success, the Tide still has some things to fix. Alabama committed 10 penalties for 71 yards and allowed the occasional big play against the Bulldogs, things that better opponents down the road might exploit more.
 “I feel like we have a lot more work to do,” said linebacker Dylan Moses, who recorded an interception in the end zone to stop a score in the third quarter. "We’re taking the right steps in the right direction in getting to where we want to be. There’s always room for improvement, so it isn’t something we just want to be content with.”
 Still, Alabama’s monsters were reawoken. That should send some Halloween chills up the spines of future SEC offenses.
