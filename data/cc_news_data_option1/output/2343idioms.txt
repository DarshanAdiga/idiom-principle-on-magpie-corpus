You might assume that I would tell you to make first contact with the person at the very top of the list. But I won’t. Instead, start with number 10 or so. You will be nervous, tight, even shy at the beginning, and you will make mistakes. So gain confidence with a few lower-stakes conversations, and then start contacting your most promising targets. Make sure to rapidly cover the top 30 or so, ideally within a period of no more than a week or two. (If you’re lucky enough to find more than one possibility, it would be ideal to consider all of them at once.)

The Recovery trial - which stands for Randomised Evaluation of COVid-19 thERapY - was co-ordinated by scientists from the University of Oxford.
 Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the university's Nuffield Department of Medicine, and one of the chief investigators for the trial, described it as "an extremely welcome result".
 "This is the only drug that has so far shown to reduce mortality, and it reduces it significantly. It is a major breakthrough, I think," he said.
 "Dexamethasone is inexpensive, on the shelf, and can be used immediately to save lives worldwide."
 Martin Landray, professor of medicine and epidemiology at the Nuffield Department of Population Health, and another chief investigator, said: "Covid-19 is a global disease - it is fantastic that the first treatment demonstrated to reduce mortality is one that is instantly available and affordable worldwide.
 "It's been around for probably 60 years.
 "It costs in the order of £5… for a complete course of treatment in the NHS, and substantially less - probably less than one dollar - in other parts of the world, for example in India."
 The research team is working to publish the full results of the study as quickly as possible.

_"We live in an increasingly complex society and you should press the reset button every once in a while." — Unknown_
 As COVID-19 turned into the monster I’m not sure any of us thought it would be, my first thought was fear. Fear for family and friends with compromised immune systems. Fear for those on the front line and in the supply chain, my husband being one of them. Fear about earning a living as the gym closed and I was no longer able to teach my fitness classes. Fear of things never returning to normal. But along the way, that changed.
 Before COVID-19, I was extremely wrapped up in my daily to-do list. Talking to others I have found many were and some still are dealing with the same tunnel vision I had. Not taking time to be with and do the things most important to us. Simply not taking time to live our lives.

WASHINGTON (AP) — As businesses reopen across the U.S. after coronavirus shutdowns, many are requiring customers and workers to sign forms saying they won’t sue if they catch COVID-19.Businesses fear they could be the target of litigation even if they adhere to safety precautions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state health officials. But workers' rights groups say the forms force employees to sign away their rights should they get sick.The liability waivers, similar to what President Donald Trump's campaign is requiring for people to attend a Saturday rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, would protect businesses in states that don't have liability limits or immunity from coronavirus-related lawsuits.So far, at least five states — Utah, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Alabama — have such limits through legislation or executive orders, and others are considering them. Business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are lobbying for national immunity legislation.The novel coronavirus has sickened more than 2 million people in the U.S. and killed more than 115,000, according to Johns Hopkins University.At Salon Medusa in West Hartford, Connecticut, hair stylist Lena Whelan says they're using only two of six styling stations since reopening June 1. Customers have to wait outside, they have to wear masks, and all stations and tools are disinfected between clients.Despite all those safety measures, customers must sign a form saying they won't sue if they get infected with the novel coronavirus. The form, which also asks patrons if they or any family members have virus symptoms, gives the salon extra legal protection, Whelan said.Critics argue that liability waivers open the door for corporations to skirt protocols like erecting Plexiglas barriers, providing face masks and other protective equipment, and keeping people the proper distance apart without suffering any repercussions.The waivers are particularly onerous for workers who may feel compelled to sign them in order to keep their jobs, unlike customers who at least have a choice to walk away."It's a terrible choice for an employee," said Hugh Baran, an attorney with the National Employment Law Project, a worker advocacy group. "Do you sign this and potentially give up your legal recourse or do you refuse and feel like you are going to lose your job?"Worse yet, in many states, if workers refuse to sign the waivers and return to work, they risk losing unemployment benefits, Baran said. Also, immunity legislation and liability waivers disproportionately affect black and Latino workers, many of whom have jobs that can't be done remotely, he said.Warnings about the devastating effects of a second wave of coronavirus cases continue.Lawyers say many business clients are asking about the waivers. Whether they can be enforced varies by state and is open to debate. Owners are wise to take a "better safe than sorry" approach, said John Wolohan, a sports law professor at Syracuse University."It's hard for me to believe people don't understand the danger of going out in public and interacting. But when somebody gets sick, I'm sure they're going to claim the business didn't protect them the way they should have. By having a waiver, the business will better withstand the lawsuit," Wolohan said.In 45 states and the District of Columbia, courts will generally enforce voluntary waivers, according to "Law for Recreation and Sport Managers," a book Wolohan co-wrote with Doyice Cotten. Connecticut, Hawaii, Louisiana, Virginia and Wisconsin offer consumers the best chance to challenge liability waivers.But Baran says a lot depends on how state contract laws have been interpreted by the courts. Many states, he said, have laws on the books saying that businesses have a general duty to maintain healthy and safe working conditions. In some instances, however, courts have determined that employees can sign away those rights, he said."This is a new situation," Baran said of the liability forms related to the coronavirus. "It's hard to know how state courts would view such waivers."Data on just how many businesses require liability waivers of employees or customers is difficult to find. Lawyers say the forms are showing up at small businesses such as hair salons and gyms where it's hard to maintain social distancing. But it's also showing up at the New York Stock Exchange, where Jonathan Corpina, senior managing partner with Meridian Equity Partners Inc., said Monday he was required to sign a waiver in order to enter the trading floor.Cheryl Falvey, a partner at the Crowell and Moring law firm in Washington, D.C., and a former top lawyer at the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission, said she does not think most employers would try to get their workforce to sign them.Falvey also noted there are circumstances that waivers would not cover, including if someone who signs a waiver gets infected and then spreads the disease to family members or neighbors."I don't think these waivers would cover that," Falvey said. The wife of someone infected might argue, "I didn't sign that waiver. You let him in and you didn't protect him," she said.Harold Kim, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Institute for Legal Reform, said federal immunity legislation would be better for businesses rather than a patchwork of conflicting state laws. The legislation sought by the chamber would be temporary and grant immunity only if businesses followed CDC and state guidelines on the virus, he said."You don't get those protections if you don't follow that guidance," he said.Employees who get sick on the job might not be able to sue their employers, but would have access to workers' compensation to cover lost wages and medical care, legal experts said. Proposed federal legislation wouldn't affect workers' compensation programs, which most states have, Kim said.Through Monday, there were 2,741 lawsuits filed in the U.S. over COVID-19 infections, according to a complaint tracker maintained by the Hunton Andrews Kurth law firm. Many of the cases were over government shutdown orders and which businesses were deemed essential. Only seven came from consumers and 49 were filed by employees over exposure to the virus or other related injuries. Kim said federal legislation would prevent a big surge in litigation.____Business Writer Alex Veiga contributed from Los Angeles. Krisher reported from Detroit.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

Building materials stores enjoyed a monthly gain of 10.9% last month and annualized growth of 16.4%. Grocers have posed a 14.4% annual sales increase, reflecting fewer people eating out at restaurants because of the pandemic.
 Other sectors in retail posted spectacular growth in May yet still face an uncertain future given the blows they absorbed in March and April. Clothiers achieved a stunning 188% monthly gain but still remain down 63% over the past 12 months. Furniture store sales surged 90% last month, but they're still down more than 21% on the year. This same pattern holds for restaurants, electronics stores, department stores and auto dealers.
 Retail sales account for roughly half of all consumer spending, which fuels about 70% of total economic activity. The rest of consumer spending includes services, from cellphone and internet contracts to gym memberships and child care.
 Nearly 80% of small retailers and restaurants tracked by the scheduling tool Homebase that were closed in mid-April have since reopened. Yet these smaller businesses remain under pressure. Their stresses in part reflect changes emerging as social distancing has become essential and shopping habits evolve.
 One such retailer, CPW, a women’s clothing store, has been in business for 30 years on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. A three-month shutdown resulting from the virus meant the store retained only 20% to 30% of its sales as the owner, Linda Wolff, packed and delivered orders to customer homes. Though CPW reopened for curbside pickup a week ago, Wolff said she hasn’t rung up a single such sale.

"So, given this lack of information … we have decided that it is a safer option to close this project for the time being,” Moller told The Associated Press.
 MSF had been working at the clinic in the predominantly Hazara neighborhood in collaboration with the Afghan Ministry of Public Health since 2014, providing free-of-charge maternity and neonatal care. The group started working in Afghanistan in 1980 and continues to run medical programs in the provinces of Helmand, Herat, Kandahar, Khost, and Kunduz. Other projects would continue, MSF said.
 “It is going to affect a lot of people, not just our team, but also the wider community at large, in particular the community that we were serving in Dasht- e-Barchi," Moller said .
 The work that the organization did at the clinic affected some 1.5 million people of the area, he added. Last year, 16,000 babies were delivered at the hospital, a statistic that MSF was proud of. Now, around 130 hospital staff members funded by MSF would lose their pay.
 “It is a huge impact, not just for our organization, but for the community at large,” Moller added.
 The May attack in Kabul was not the worst involving MSF. In October 2015, a U.S. Air Force AC-130 gunship repeatedly struck a well-marked Doctors Without Borders hospital, killing 30 people in the northern Afghan city of Kunduz.
 At the time, U.S. and Afghan forces were locked in a ground battle to retake the city of 300,000 from the Taliban. There were 105 patients, 140 Afghan staffers and nine international staff inside, along with dozens of visitors who were caring for friends and relatives as is a custom in Afghanistan.

 Pleading through tears on Monday, Brooks' relatives demanded changes in the criminal justice system and called on protesters to refrain from violence as tensions remain high across the U.S. three weeks after George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis.
 An autopsy found that Brooks, 27, was shot twice in the back. Two white officers had responded to calls about a man who was asleep at the wheel in a Wendy's drive-thru lane. Police video showed him cooperating until a breath test determined his blood-alcohol level was over the legal limit and one of the officers moved to handcuff him. The officers took him to the ground. Brooks broke free and took off with a stun gun; a white officer shot him as he tried to run away.
 “When does it stop? We’re not only pleading for justice. We’re pleading for change,” said Chassidy Evans, Brooks’ niece.
 Relatives described Brooks as a loving father of three daughters and a stepson who had a bright smile and a big heart and loved to dance. Evans said there was no reason for him “to be shot and killed like trash in the street for falling asleep in a drive-thru.”
 Floyd’s death on May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer pressed his knee into the black man’s neck touched off demonstrations and scattered violence across the U.S., and Brooks’ killing rekindled those protests in Atlanta. The Wendy’s restaurant where Brooks was shot was burned down over the weekend.
