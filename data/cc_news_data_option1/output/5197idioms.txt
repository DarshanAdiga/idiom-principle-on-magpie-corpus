Alas, as Christians we are ambassadors of a kingdom that's not of this world, but our King has been given all power, which means all power, in this world. Ambassadors exist to serve their nation's interests. Ambassador's of Christ should actively be seeking to make the world more Christlike, not because of our eschatology or because the gospel needs maintenance, rather because faith without works is dead. We have a Great Commission to serve for a Kingdom not of this world. One might call that Christian Nationalism. Now if this Christian Nationalism manifests itself in the form of supporting a movement to reform America to a time when it was greater than the decay I've seen in my lifetime, because such a time America was more committed to Christian principles, then that is advancing the cause of the Kingdom. After all, the alternative to this manifestation is globalism which at present speed will take us straight to the Tower of Babel. Many Christians believe that supporting Trump's brand of nationalism is the best means available to head off the sequel to the Tower of Babel, and who can blame them for wanting that.

Mainstream culture continues to marginalize and vilify men to a fatiguing degree. Young men, in particular, are increasingly at a loss. The prohibition of masculinity is stunting men and ostracizing them to the fringes of society. As a consequence, men are losing the ability to rise to the occasion when faced with hardships and obstacles. Instead – out of increased dejection and despair – they’re choosing to succumb and, finally, give up.

From the 1980s through the early 2000s, ATF classified the core components of handguns and rifles—frames and receivers—as “firearms” subject to federal regulation if the components could be quickly and easily converted into functioning guns. In 2015, however, the agency reversed course without explanation and issued an interpretive rule stating that these rifle receivers and handgun frames were not considered firearms under the Gun Control Act. The about-face has spawned an unlicensed and unregulated online industry in which these ghost guns, so-called because they have no serial numbers and leave no identifying marks on bullet casings, can be sold to any consumer without a background check.

 Prosecutors said Harris, Schaeffer and Keishira Robinson were riding in a vehicle owned by Anthony Robinson when its driver, Roderick Hickman, steered it into a tractor trailer on Oct. 13, 2015, at Alvar Street and France Road.

  Jeremy Gorner, Chicago Tribune


  December 17, 2020, 10:36 PM


  CHICAGO — John Catanzara, president of the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 7, is facing possible dismissal from the Chicago Police Department for offensive posts on social media, it was disclosed Thursday night at the monthly meeting of the city’s police disciplinary panel.


  The case could be decided by the full Chicago Police Board in the coming months.


  Chicago police Superintendent David Brown on Thursday night was overruled by a member of the panel in deciding a punishment for Catanzara, leader of the largest union of Chicago police officers.


  According to information from the Police Board, Catanzara in 2016 posted offensive messages on Facebook. One message read, “Wtf its seriously time to kill these (expletives),” without mentioning exactly who Catanzara was writing about.


  In another post in 2017, according to the board, Catanzara made a statement on Facebook that was disparaging to Muslims, reading, “Savages they all deserve a bullet.” Catanzara did not become FOP president until May.


  Sydney Roberts, chief administrator of the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, recommended earlier this year that Catanzara be fired in the case while Brown disagreed, calling for a one-year suspension.


  But after Police Board member Andrea Zopp was randomly chosen to review the case, per city ordinance, she announced at the board’s monthly meeting Thursday night that Brown was not persuasive enough to overcome COPA’s recommendation.


  “After considering this matter, it is my opinion that the superintendent did not meet the burden of overcoming the chief administrator’s recommendation for discipline,” said Zopp, a former deputy mayor under Mayor Rahm Emanuel who is president and CEO of World Business Chicago. “Based on the facts and circumstances of this matter, an evidentiary hearing before the Police Board is necessary to determine whether Officer Catanzara violated any of the Police Department’s rules of conduct.”


  Zopp’s decision does not mean that COPA’s findings in the case were correct and that Brown’s rationale was wrong. But it sets the stage for a historic disciplinary hearing that could determine whether Catanzara should lose his job as a Chicago cop.


  Story continues


  Catanzara could not immediately be reached for comment.


  A spokesman for Brown also was not immediately available to comment on the Catanzara decision.


  That case was an especially unusual one for Brown, who, as Chicago’s top cop, has tried to work with Catanzara in his capacity as FOP president to not alienate the Police Department’s thousands of rank-and-file officers, including those who supported Catanzara in the last union election. But Catanzara has had an extremely contentious relationship with Brown’s boss, Mayor Lori Lightfoot, whose administration is in the middle of tense contract negotiations with the police union.


  COPA records show the case stems from a complaint filed by Catanzara’s commander in 2017, who accused him of expressing “bigoted views on social media,” including making “hostile remarks against Muslims, sexist remarks about women and liberals, and remarks about (former first lady) Michelle Obama.” The commander also alleged Catanzara used social media to call for “the murder of college students” and made “defamatory statements against those participating in social programs, and stated that officers should not attempt to chase offenders.”


  Catanzara was also accused in the complaint of sending “inappropriate emails to Hubbard High School staff, in that the accused officer accuses (Chicago Public Schools) staff of racist tactics, questions their recruitment process, and identifies himself as a Chicago Police Officer while doing so.” That part of the allegations was not specifically referenced Thursday.


  On the same day the commander filed the complaint, Catanzara posted a photo of himself on Facebook in an apparent protest of NFL players who knelt during the national anthem at the start of football games. The photo showed him in uniform holding an American flag as he stood in front of a marked Chicago police SUV.


  The Police Department issued Catanzara a reprimand — among the lightest punishments a Chicago cop can face — for violating rules that prohibit officers from participating in any partisan political campaign or activity while on duty.


  Overall, he has a lengthy history of complaints filed against him since becoming a Chicago cop in 1995. Records obtained by the Chicago Tribune show by the end of mid-2017, he had amassed at least 35 complaints, many for personnel violations. He’s also been suspended several times in his career, and past police superintendents have tried twice to fire him.


  In August 2008, then-Superintendent Jody Weis sought Catanzara’s firing on allegations that he did not follow orders to complete a psychological exam, according to police board records. But in February 2009, the board cleared Catanzara in a 5-3 decision.


  Three years later, then-Superintendent Garry McCarthy tried to fire him for working a side job as a security guard for a restaurant when he was supposed to be on medical leave for a back injury. The police board found him guilty in that case of several Police Department violations, board records show. But instead of firing him, the board voted 7-2 to suspend Catanzara for 20 days.


  In May, Catanzara won a runoff election to become the next FOP president, defeating then-incumbent Kevin Graham. Catanzara received close to 55% of the vote, garnering 4,709 votes to Graham’s 3,872, according to the union.


  At the time, Catanzara was relieved of his police powers and under investigation by the Police Department on allegations related to a 2018 police report he filed against then-police Superintendent Eddie Johnson. Catanzara accused him of breaking the law by allowing marchers onto the Dan Ryan Expressway to protest city violence.


  That complaint remains under investigation by the Police Department’s internal affairs bureau.


  Thursday night’s decision also marked the third time in two months that a police board member overruled Brown in officer misconduct cases in which he sought more lenient punishments for cops who COPA investigators felt should be fired. In October, police board members determined Brown did not meet “his burden of overcoming” COPA’s recommendations that three officers in two 2018 shootings be fired. Those two cases will be presented to the rest of the board members in the coming months.

N.C. State scheduled a game with St. Louis just two days ago and it turned out to be the Wolfpack's toughest test yet.
 The Wolfpack, playing for the first time since Dec. 3, hit the road and took on the Billikens, with just nine players available due to COVID-19 issues within their program. After jumping out to a comfortable lead and controlling the first half, N.C. State's lack of depth, and games, showed late. SLU (6-0) outscored the Wolfpack 51-34 in the second half to remain undefeated with a 80-69 win.
 Demarius Jenkins hit a three from the right wing to put the Billikens up by five with 6:32 remaining and it felt like the biggest shot of the game. It gave SLU its biggest lead of the second half and it only lasted one possession. After the Billikens got the ball back, Hasahn French scored in front of the Wolfpack's Manny Bates, a redshirt sophomore forward to push the lead to seven.
 The heavy legs caught up with the Wolfpack as the combination of Yuri Collins, French and Jacobs gave the N.C. State (3-1) its first loss of the season. The Billikens' late 11-2 run ruined what could have been an impressive road win for N.C. State, which has had five games canceled this season due to COVID-19.
 The Wolfpack is scheduled to host Campbell Saturday. Head coach Kevin Keatts wanted to get a game in before facing the Camels and St. Louis and head coach Travis Ford became available. Keatts said he wanted his team to be tested before their game against Campbell. The Wolfpack passed in the first half.

 Apuntó que están a la espera de poder capacitar a la gente de este sector, con platicas de como cuidar el campo, para beneficio propio y de la comunidad.
 Reconoció que, a pesar de las limitantes para el acceso a los recursos para el campo, el municipio también estará buscando esquemas para seguir respaldando a todas las familias que dependen de esta actividad.
 Comentó que derivado de las pláticas, los campesinos han externado su preocupación por el abandono al sector, por lo que dijo que será permanente el acercamiento a través de las diferentes áreas del gobierno municipal.
 “El sector solicita más apoyos y la reapertura a los programas federales que ya existían y que los programas que ya existen que no sean complicados en el tema de su tramitología”, mencionó.
 Por último, Germain Garfias, señaló que de acuerdo a la información de los propios productores del campo, este año cerrarán de manera crítica, ya que por una parte la pandemia los afectó y por otro la temporada de lluvias no los favoreció.
 “El sector serrará un año complicado no solo por la pandemia, sino por la sequía, debido a que las presas no han tendido mucha captación de agua y los diferentes tipos de cambio que se han presentado en la entidad han hecho complicada la travesía de este año para el sector”, puntualizó.

"In the bigger picture, this study was motivated by the very practical question of what happens to rainwater when falling on solar farms with thousands and thousands of solar panels in the desert - but to answer questions like that, sometimes you have to dig deep and answer more fundamental questions first."
