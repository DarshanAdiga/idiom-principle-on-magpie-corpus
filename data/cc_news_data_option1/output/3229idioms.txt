NAPERVILLE - Wayne S. Stuart, age 69, a resident of Naperville, IL since 1974, formerly of Elmhurst, IL, passed away peacefully at his home on August 6, 2020, following a courageous battle with aggressive cancer. Wayne was born on January 15, 1951 in Chicago, IL to his loving parents, the late Zigmund and Stephanie. The family moved to Elmhurst, IL where Wayne attended grade school through high school. He was a 1969 graduate of York Community High School and a 1973 graduate of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where he received a Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration. Wayne worked as a director of business development in the construction industry. Wayne enjoyed history, lively political discussions, traveling, nature and sports, especially cheering on the Fighting Illini, the Chicago Bears and the Chicago Cubs. Most of all, Wayne loved his family, attending every activity his children participated in and spending time with his grandchildren. Wayne is survived by his loving wife of 47 years, Barb (nee Griese), beloved children, David (Amy) Stuart, Kristen (Jeremy) Didier, Katie (Ted) Nichols, cherished grandchildren, Jaxon, Felicity, Holly, Charlie, Sophia and Oliver, fond brother-in-law, Fred Griese, and dear cousin, Jim (Tim) Patterson.

The Carolina Connection, the pipeline that head coach Sean McDermott began establishing in 2017 between his former team, the Carolina Panthers, and his new team, the Buffalo Bills, remains as fruitful as ever.


  Since the former Panthers defensive coordinator was hired by the Bills, there have been 21 players with ties to Carolina who have been brought to Buffalo and they have delivered varying degrees of productivity, or lack thereof.


  McDermott and his personnel partner, general manager Brandon Beane, who had previously served as the assistant GM in Carolina, were familiar with every one of those players from their days with the Panthers.


  "Yeah, I think that does help," Beane said of the pre-existing relationships. "And that's part of it in planning. These were some guys that we did target."


  The reliance McDermott and Beane have had on their days in Carolina regarding some of their personnel moves is not new in the NFL as many other coaches and GM do the same thing.


  Free agency can sometimes be a crap shoot if the shopping list is populated with players you've never had a connection with. You watch film, talk to people who know the player, but firsthand knowledge is such an added bonus.


  "When we got to Philadelphia," McDermott said, recalling his time coaching under Andy Reid with the Eagles, "Andy signed a couple players from Green Bay that he knew from his time in Green Bay and, and it's always nice. Number one, that we're able to get those players here, but also it's humbling on the other end that they will want to come and play for me and Brandon again because there's 31 other teams that they could choose from."


  Fans sometimes chuckle - "Here comes another guy from Carolina" - but in all the decisions they have made on ex-Panthers, McDermott and Beane knew what they were getting, and they had a vision for how each could fit into the program they were constructing in Buffalo.


  Some of the transactions didn't work out - the trade for wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin in 2017 serving as the shining example - but in several cases the players have made viable contributions either on the field with their performance, helping their teammates understand McDermott's defensive system, or in simply helping to set the tone and culture in the locker room.


  This past offseason could prove to be the most fertile ex-Panthers recruitment class yet because the Bills have big plans for defensive linemen Mario Addison and Vernon Butler, cornerback Josh Norman and linebacker A.J. Klein.


  Start with Norman, who played his best football when he was in McDermott's Carolina defense and now is coming back to play in that system after four somewhat mediocre seasons in Washington.


  "There's been a lot of talk of how he played and how his chapter in Washington maybe didn't unfold the way that a lot of people had hoped," McDermott said. "With our culture, and the same system, really, he'll be able to regain his form and I know he's working extremely hard at it."


  Levi Wallace isn't going to just cede his starting role to the veteran, so that is shaping up to be the best positional battle in training camp.


  Like Norman, Klein wasn't a direct import from Carolina because he left there after the 2016 season as a free agent and spent the previous three years starting at outside linebacker for New Orleans.


  With Lorenzo Alexander retiring, there was a positional need and Klein fit the bill, the only difference being that he plays more as an off-ball linebacker compared to Alexander, who did that but also rushed the passer from the edge. Having upgraded at edge rusher, the Bills probably won't ask Klein to replicate Alexander's role.


  "I know he was a tremendous player, a tremendous man, but still, I don't feel any pressure to fill any kind of hole or void or anything because I know who I am as a player and as a person," Klein said. "And I hope I just fit in with the group with how I fit in. I'm not trying to fill his shoes, per se."


  Klein jumped at the chance to reunite with McDermott. "Familiarity, knowing coach McDermott, and obviously some of the guys that I've played with over the years are starting to come here as well," he said. "And this is a young team that's here to win and on the cusp of something great. I see the potential for a championship and I definitely want to cap off my career with the championship before I retire."


  Addison figures to start opposite Jerry Hughes on the edge as the replacement for departed Shaq Lawson. Over the last three seasons he recorded 29.5 sacks, double Lawson's total in that stretch.


  Addison is one of Beane's favorite players because when he was serving as the Panthers' interim GM back in 2012, after Marty Hurney had been fired, he brought Addison to Carolina from Washington, and during his 7½ years with the Panthers Addison totaled 55 sacks.


  "Mario was a guy that I stole off the Redskins practice squad," Beane recalled. "He had bounced around that year through several teams. Mario is just a real pro, and I know where his age is (33 on Sept. 6), but you watch the film and he's still getting it done."


  Butler was signed to be part of a rotation at defensive tackle, but his role will now be increased after another ex-Panther, Star Lotulelei, decided to opt out of the 2020 season because of COVID-19 concerns. Butler may very well end up being the starter next to Ed Oliver, with Harrison Phillips, Quinton Jefferson and Vincent Taylor vying to join the mix.


  "The light seemed to come on a little bit for Vernon last year," said Beane of the player who was Carolina's first-round pick in 2016, Beane's last year in Carolina's front office. "His first few years probably weren't up to where we saw his talent level when we drafted him, but I think he had (six) sacks last season and just felt like the light was starting to come on."


  Here again, having that connection and knowing where a player has been in his career and the arc it has taken is important. Beane said he thinks Butler can become a version of Jordan Phillips who the Bills grabbed off the waiver wire in 2018 when he had a falling out in Miami and resurrected his career in Buffalo, leading to a free agent deal with the Cardinals.


  "Maybe a guy who, not everything has played out perfectly yet, you know," Beane said of Butler. "Jordan was a second-round pick (by Miami), and we just feel like our system fits Vernon the way it did Jordan and hopefully he can get to the level that Jordan did before Jordan left for Arizona."

But flawless? Not quite. Mac and Me was flawed beyond repair, as the dance scene in McDonald's was something that you might have trouble getting out of your head after a while. But E.T. still has plenty of other flaws that a lot of people might not want to see pointed out since to be certain, a lot of folks happen to love this movie in a big way and it helped define many a childhood since the magic of E.T. is that it's one of the many movies that made it okay to suspend belief for a while and just go with it. Sometimes that's the trick to enjoying a movie though, put your belief elsewhere for the time being and just enjoy what's there. If not for that then E.T. would be subject to just as many questions as any other movie since flawless isn't the word to describe this movie despite the fact that the effects, for that time period, were pretty good and it was an impressive movie. But like many others it was fun and it was engaging, but it was also something geared towards kids, and unfortunately, there's still an idea that kids' movies can't always contend with other movies, even if it's been proven wrong before.

This one really put a big smile on my face.   Like a tall tumbler of iced Southern Comfort on a hot, humid day the album is both refreshing and more than a little intoxicating.      Loisiana’s LeRoux have been around since the mid Seventies, originally as a backing band for Clarence ‘Gatemouth’ Brown and Clifton Chenier )as the Levee Band) and then in their own right as The Jeff Pollard Band and eventually their most famous title.      The music is hot and steamy New Orleans flavoured Southern Blues rock with a huge feel for funk and groove and a wicked sense of humour. Really, what’s not to like.      The current line-up is Tony Haselden – vocals, guitars, Rod Roddy – vocals, keyboards, synthesizers, Jim Odom – guitars, Nelson Blanchard – keyboards, vocals, Mark Duthu – percussion, Randy Carpenter – drums, Jeff McCarty – vocals, Joey Decker – bass, backing vocals with only Haselden & Roddy from the original band line-up.      As an album there really isn’t a single track that doesn’t work but I do have some slight issue in that every track sounds as though a different band were playing it – sometime a Little Feat style groover, sometimes they are in Allman Brothers Band territory or they might stray into a Doobie Brothers tight jam sound – that having been said though, every track has some charms.      There are some real standout numbers: the title track is a fast Blues-rocker with great percussion and some gorgeous guitar while ‘Lucy Anna’ has a wonderful and infectious honky tonk piano line and really complex rhythms.      Well worth a punt, it really does catch the ear.

Tiffany Foxworth won a seat on the 19th Judicial District Court by only 27 votes in Baton Rouge's Saturday election. Johnell Matthews was also elected a city court judge by a much wider margin.


  There were 18,417 votes cast in the 19th JDC election, according to complete but unofficial election results. The results must still be certified by election officials.


  Foxworth will fill the remainder of a term in Division M that expires Dec. 31. She will face a rematch with Alexander for a full six-year term on Nov. 3; the two are the only candidates who qualified last month for the fall election.


  Foxworth had won 37% of the vote in the July 11 primary to Alexander's 34%, putting them in the runoff. Two other candidates split the remaining vote in the primary.


  The Division M seat opened up when state District Judge Beau Higginbotham, who held the seat, was elected to the 19th JDC's Division C seat nearer to his home last fall. That seat was vacated by retired Judge Lou Daniel.


  Foxworth, a registered nurse and U.S. Army veteran, has been a lawyer since 2005 and said she possessed the temperament, leadership skills and legal expertise to sit on the state court bench. She said her criminal court experience distinguished her.


  Alexander, who practiced law for 16 years before being elected to City Court in 1995, said during the campaign that her 25 years on the bench is what set her apart.


  Division M is a district in north Baton Rouge that includes Baker, Zachary and Central and goes down into Sherwood Forest.


  Johnell Matthews, who at 70 is older than the state's mandatory retirement age for judges, defeated fellow lawyer Whitney Higginbotham Greene in Saturday's coronavirus-delayed runoff for a seat on Baton Rouge City Court.


  Matthews won by 63% of the vote compared to Greene's 37%, according to complete but unofficial election results.


  Matthews was 69 when she qualified in January to run in what was to have been an April 4 primary election with a possible May runoff, but the pandemic twice pushed that date back.


  Matthews, a Democrat, turned 70 a month before the July 11 primary, in which she placed a close second to Greene, 49, a Republican, forcing a runoff.


  A state district judge, state appeals court and the Louisiana Supreme Court all allowed Matthews to remain on the runoff ballot after her candidacy was challenged Aug. 3. Greene was not involved in that litigation.


  The Louisiana Constitution sets a mandatory retirement age of 70 for judges but allows them to serve out the remainder of their terms if they reach that age while in office.


  Matthews, who has 18 years of legal experience in Louisiana and Mississippi, insisted during the campaign that she shouldn't be penalized for a pandemic pushing the election date beyond her 70th birthday.


  Greene, who took a leave of absence as an assistant state attorney general during the campaign, argued Matthews would not be able to serve, because of restrictions based on her age, if Matthews won.


  In his ruling Tuesday, District Judge William Morvant agreed with Matthews and cited a recent coronavirus-related state Supreme Court ruling involving one of Morvant's 19th Judicial District Court colleagues, Judge Richard "Chip" Moore.


  Moore has been hospitalized with the virus since early July and was unable to personally sign his qualifying papers by the July 24 deadline, but the Supreme Court ruled that the extraordinary pandemic should not knock Moore out of his reelection bid.


  The high court allowed Moore's campaign chairman to sign the judge's papers so Moore could appear on the Nov. 3 ballot. The justices said Moore only had to sign them by Nov. 2, which he already has done. Moore has since been reelected after his two challengers dropped out.


  The City Court Division C seat on Saturday's ballot was vacated last fall when City Court Judge Tarvald Smith won the 19th JDC Division A seat that was left open when Judge Todd Hernandez retired last year. The City Court term expires at the end of 2024.


  Greene is the daughter of state 1st Circuit Court of Appeal Judge Toni Higginbotham and retired Judge Leo Higginbotham, and sister of 19th Judicial District Court Judge Beau Higginbotham.


  Matthews is the wife of former East Baton Rouge Parish Metro Councilman Johnnie Matthews.


  The state Supreme Court last month upheld Louisiana's mandatory retirement age for judges, a decision that caused Toni Higginbotham to withdraw her candidacy for another 1st Circuit term because she is 74.


  The high court's ruling came in the consolidated cases of 19th Judicial District Court Judge Janice Clark, 73, and New Orleans Magistrate Judge Harry Cantrell, 72, who were hoping to run again despite their ages. The justices said they couldn't seek another term.

The Rodeo plant is well suited for conversion because of its dock and rail access for receiving the tallows, vegetable oils and used cooking oils that will feed into plant, Nik Weinberg-Lynn, manager of renewable energy projects at Phillips 66, said by phone. The facility has two hydrocrackers that are important to the conversion process as well a plentiful supply of hydrogen.


  “The California market for the renewable diesel product is certainly the largest in the world,” he said.


  Phillips 66 plans to invest $700 million to $800 million in the conversion including constructing pre-treatment facilities, Weinberg-Lynn said. The Rodeo plant could start operating as early as 2024, producing 680 million gallons a year of about 70% renewable diesel, 10% gasoline, and 20% jet fuel, the company said.


  The San Francisco refinery has an additional project under way that is expected to start up in the second quarter of 2021 and will produce 120 million gallons a year of renewable diesel. Phillips 66 also announced it would be closing its 45,000 barrel-a-day plant in Santa Maria in 2023. The shutdown comes after years of declining retail gasoline sales in the state, according to Energy Information Administration data.


  Last week, Marathon said it will convert its 166,000 barrel-a-day Martinez, California, refinery into a terminal facility and that may include a 48,000 barrel-a-day renewable diesel plant as soon as 2022. The company is turning its 19,000 barrel-a-day North Dakota plant into a renewable diesel plant by the end of this year. Earlier this week, Exxon Mobil Corp. signed an agreement with Global Clean Energy Holdings Inc. to buy 2.5 million barrels a year of renewable diesel for five years from a converted Bakersfield refinery.


  The surge of new entrants into the California renewable diesel market is creating its own problems, Van der Wal said. So many projects are being proposed that there may not be sufficient diesel demand in California to absorb the additional fuel. Also, existing renewable diesel suppliers to California, including Neste SA and Valero Energy Corp., have locked up much of the feedstock, leaving less tallow and cooking oil for the newcomers.


  Phillips 66 hasn’t yet secured all the necessary feedstock for the plant but is confident it can, Weinberg-Lynn said.


  “We do firmly believe, while it will be a challenge, that there is enough,” he said.

In the months since the killing of George Floyd unleashed a nationwide reckoning over policing and systemic racism, communities have been having hard conversations about the vast differences in the experiences citizens of different races have with their police. There is even a push to rethink policing on a grand scale -- this conversation has run the gamut from body cameras to sensitivity training to defunding the police. And, there's another conversation that's gaining traction nationwide: Do police department personnel reflect the racial diversity of the communities they serve? How would a more diverse police force impact community relations? And, what are police chiefs and city leaders doing to increase diversity among officers?

“The latest chaos is the inevitable consequence of this Government’s shambolic approach to exams, which saw solutions dreamt up on the back of a cigarette packet and announced barely a day before young people received their results.”


  The latest setback comes as ministers were braced for a fresh backlash when GCSE results for England are announced on Thursday.


  Like the A-level results, they will initially be based on teacher assessments and then “moderated” by the Ofqual algorithm to bring them in line with previous years’ results.


  Mr Williamson has said the process was necessary to prevent “grade inflation” which would render the results worthless after actual exams had to be abandoned due to the coronavirus outbreak.


  However critics have complained it has led to thousands of individual injustices, disproportionately penalising students from schools serving disadvantaged communities.

But South Korea is now dealing with a virus resurgence in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan region, home to half of the country’s 51 million people. It forced U.S. Forces Korea to designate the capital and surrounding areas off-limits to personnel who don’t live there. The 279 new cases South Korea reported on Sunday are the highest daily jump since early March.


  There have been around 150 COVID-19 infections among U.S. troops stationed in South Korea since February, which prompted Gyeonggi Province near Seoul last month to openly call for the cancellation of the August drills. Gyeonggi includes the city of Pyeongtaek, the site of U.S. military headquarters.


  The allies have downsized much of their combined training activity after Trump unilaterally suspended large-scale field training with South Korea after his first summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June 2018. Trump then seemed to adopt North Korea’s traditional view of such drills, criticizing them as a “provocative” drain of money.


  Nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang have faltered since the collapse of Trump’s second meeting with Kim in February last year in Vietnam, where the Americans rejected North Korea’s demand for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities.


  The North reacted to last year’s summertime drills by ramping up its short- range missile tests and unleashing verbal vitriol toward South Korea, which had lobbied hard to revive nuclear talks between Washington and Pyongyang.

NewsUSA) Owning a home is a huge investment and once they've owned long enough to build up equity, many homeowners opt to leverage the equity for other uses. But if you're on the fence about taking on another monthly loan payment, an option that may be right for you is co-investing.


  With a home equity loan, you borrow against the equity in your home and receive a lump sum of money that you have to pay back each month over a specified term — commonly 15 years.


  The interest rate is usually fixed, but is typically higher than your primary mortgage.


  Co-investing offers an alternative to traditional home equity loans. In a nutshell, the co-investing company pays the homeowner an upfront amount, with no repayments for a set number of years or until the home is sold, whichever comes first. There may also be an option to buy the company out, after a minimum restriction period passes. This option can be ideal for a homeowner who wants access to cash without the added financial burden of monthly loan payments, who has lived in a home long enough to build up some equity and plans to stay at least another five years.

With the entire world in the worst crisis faced since World War II, many engage in magical thinking.


  Soon, as if waking up from a bad dream, everything will suddenly be back to normal. It won’t be. This will be a long slog that will change some “institutions,” as economists use the term, permanently. What we can do to fix this is limited, but not zero. The question is how we can best minimize damage to our economy and our society.


  At the end of the week, the House, Senate and Trump administration remained mired over a second COVID-19 relief bill. It isn’t even a “deadlock” over one or two key points of contention despite agreement on almost everything else. It is, at its core, a key fundamental debate. The GOP majority in the Senate is all over the map and will not or cannot work with the Republican administration for a coherent plan to contrast that of the House Democrats. So discussions of an economic package needs be very generic, especially with regard to total money appropriated.
