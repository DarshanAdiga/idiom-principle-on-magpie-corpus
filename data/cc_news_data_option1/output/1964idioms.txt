Whitmer declared a state of emergency for Midland County and urged residents threatened by the flooding to find a place to stay with friends or relatives or to seek out one of several shelters that opened across the county. She encouraged people to do their best to take precautions to prevent the spread of coronavirus, such as wearing a face covering and observing social distancing “to the best of your ability.”
 “This is unlike anything we’ve seen in Midland County,” she said. ”If you have a family member or loved one who lives in another part of the state, go there now."
 Emergency responders went door-to-door early Tuesday morning warning residents living near the Edenville Dam of the rising water. Some residents were able to return home, only to be told to leave again following the dam's breach several hours later. The evacuations include the towns of Edenville, Sanford and parts of Midland, according to Selina Tisdale, spokeswoman for Midland County.
 “We were back at home and starting to feel comfortable that things were calming down,” said Catherine Sias, who lives about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) from the Edenville Dam and first left home early Tuesday morning. “All of a sudden we heard the fire truck sirens going north toward the dam.”
 Sias, 45, said emergency alerts then began coming on her cellphone and people started calling to make sure she was safe.
 “While packing, there were tons of police and fire trucks going up and down the roads,” she added. “As far as I know, all of our neighbors got out.”

In an interview, Loverro declined to discuss the exact details of why he resigned.
 "It had nothing to do with commercial crew," he said. "It had to do with moving fast on Artemis, and I don't want to characterize it in any more detail than that." Artemis is NASA's program to return people to the moon.
 Last month, NASA awarded three contracts, worth nearly $1 billion combined, to a team led by Blue Origin, a team led by Dynetics and to SpaceX. (Blue Origin is owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post.)
 Loverro said there were "no sour grapes" and that he holds "NASA in great respect. I hope they can continue on everything they started and will follow through on their plans."
 On May 27, SpaceX is scheduled to launch two NASA astronauts on a test flight of the Dragon Spacecraft to the space station. In a statement Tuesday, NASA indicated the launch would proceed without delay.
 "Next week will mark the beginning of a new era in human spaceflight with the launch of NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the International Space Station," the agency said. "This test flight will be a historic and momentous occasion that will see the return of human spaceflight to our country, and the incredible dedication by the men and women of NASA is what has made this mission possible."

Le fabricant de moteurs d'avion britannique Rolls-Royce va supprimer au moins 9.000 postes pour faire face à une crise "sans précédent" à cause de l'effondrement du trafic aérien provoquée par la pandémie de coronavirus.
 Les suppressions envisagées représentent 17% d'une main d'oeuvre totale de 52.000 personnes. Elle toucheront essentiellement les activités d'aviation civile, un peu de fonctions administratives, mais pas la branche défense.
 Il "faudra plusieurs années pour que le marché de l'aéronautique commercial retrouve ses niveaux d'il y a quelques mois", justifie le groupe.
 "Nos clients dans l'aviation et l'aéronautique doivent s'adapter et nous aussi", affirme Warren East, le directeur général, cité dans le communiqué.
 Selon lui, "les gouvernements font ce qu'ils peuvent pour soutenir les entreprises à court terme mais (...) ils ne peuvent remplacer de façon durable la demande de clients qui n'existe" plus.
 Rolls-Royce précise que sa restructuration "majeure" accompagnée de réductions de coûts "dans les usines et les actifs, les capitaux et les (frais) indirects" devrait au total permettre d'économiser 1,3 milliard de livres (1,45 milliard d'euros), dont 700 millions viendront des licenciements. Le groupe avait notamment déjà annulé le versement d'un dividende.
 Depuis 2018, le motoriste avait déjà réduit sa main-d'oeuvre de 4.600 personnes, essentiellement dans l'administratif.
 Rolls-Royce avait réduit sa perte nette en 2019 grâce à de meilleures performances commerciales, malgré les coûteux problèmes sur ses moteurs d'avion Trent 1000 qui plombaient ses comptes depuis plusieurs années, mais la crise sanitaire lui porte un nouveau coup frontal.
 Le secteur de l'aérien est l'un des plus touchés par les retombées de la pandémie de coronavirus et des mesures de confinement et restrictions des déplacements mises en place pour freiner sa propagation.
 Au Royaume-Uni et en Irlande, les compagnies aériennes British Airways, Virgin Atlantic et Ryanair entre autres ont déjà annoncé des milliers de suppressions d'emplois.
 Par ailleurs, le ministre britannique des Transports Grant Shapps a indiqué au Parlement lundi que 43.500 personnes avaient été mises au chômage technique dans l'aviation au Royaume-Uni à cause de la crise du coronavirus, et 2.600 dans les aéroports.
 \- "Opportunisme honteux" -
 "Supprimer autant de postes sera en soi un gros effort, coûtera des centaines de millions de livres et pourrait s'accompagner de perturbations politiques vu que les activités aérospatiales sont essentiellement basées au Royaume-Uni", remarque Russ Mould, directeur des investissements chez AJ Bell.
 En outre, si le secteur de l'aviation se reprend, devoir recruter et former beaucoup de gens d'un coup pourrait freiner le groupe, ajoute-t-il.
 Mais "pour le moment Rolls-Royce n'a pas le luxe de pouvoir regarder bien loin, il doit rester en vol en pleine tempête", conclut M. Mould.
 Les syndicats ont vivement réagi à l'annonce du plan social à venir: Unite a fustigé "un opportunisme honteux".
 "Nous allons rencontrer la direction dans les jours à venir pour les convaincre d'adopter une approche différente et allons faire pression sur le gouvernement pour qu'il intervienne et protège la base industrielle" du pays, ajoute le syndicat dans un communiqué.
 "Il faut envoyer un signal clair selon lequel il est possible de repositionner le Royaume-Uni" sur le marché industriel mondial.
 "Sans un tel plan beaucoup d'entreprises vont mettre à la porte beaucoup d'autres gens et le chômage de masse, des familles brisées et des communautés dévastées deviendront la sombre réalité", avertit Unite.
 L'association sectorielle ADS a pour sa part appelé le gouvernement à "être à la pointe de la réouverture internationale de l'aviation, mettre en place des aides publiques supplémentaires pour le développement de nouvelles technologies à faibles émissions de carbone, lancer des programmes majeurs de défense et d'aérospatiale", entre autres.
 Début mars, le motoriste américain General Electric avait déjà annoncé qu'il allait supprimer 10.000 emplois dans sa division d'aviation à cause des ravages provoqués par le coronavirus sur le trafic aérien.

WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s treatment of a longtime aide from Kansas who worked for him at the Central Intelligence Agency and then the State Department was under scrutiny by an inspector general recently fired by President Donald Trump, government sources familiar with the matter told McClatchy.
 The State Department inspector general, Steve Linick, was looking into the role of Toni Porter, Pompeo’s senior adviser, and whether she as a political appointee was conducting Pompeo’s personal business on government time, two sources said.
 Porter did not register a complaint herself to the inspector general. Rather, the investigation into her role was triggered by multiple complaints on the IG hotline, one of the sources said.
 Porter has been in Pompeo’s circle since his first campaign for Congress in 2010 and has a reputation as a fiercely loyal aide who is close with the secretary’s family and whose job duties run the gamut.
 Porter did not return phone calls seeking comment Monday or Tuesday.
 One Kansas political source described Porter’s role as “some combination of chief of staff and executive assistant.”

She lived her entire life with a man who became universally revered, but to millions across the globe, Annie Glenn was her own kind of hero.
 The wife of John Glenn, the former astronaut and U.S. senator, died early Tuesday morning at a nursing home near family in St. Paul, Minnesota. She was 100.
 Mr. Glenn died in 2016 at age 95 and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery.
 Annie, as everyone knew her, lived in the shadow of fame, but emerged in mid- life to become an inspiration for people with disabilities around the world by overcoming the chronic stuttering that afflicted and limited her during the years her husband was becoming a household name.
 She was born Anna Margaret Castor in Columbus on Feb. 17, 1920, and her father, a dentist, moved the family to New Concord when she was 3. Her parents joined a monthly card club called "Twice 5 Club," which included John Glenn's parents. She and John, who was 17 months younger, shared a playpen from whence a quintessential love story would take root.
 Despite her speech impediment — she stuttered 85% of the time — Annie was a top student and readily was accepted in the close-knit college town 70 miles east of Columbus in rural Muskingum County. In the sixth grade, however, she experienced her first hint of the humiliation that would haunt her through much of her life when one of the students laughed at her as she recited a poem before the class.

"Don't be long," she whispered, and from that day on she kept a gum wrapper in her purse.
 As John's prowess as a pilot culminated in his historic orbital flight on Feb. 20, 1962, the spotlight shone ever more intensely on the Glenn family, which by then included a son, David, and a daughter, Lyn. After becoming the first American to orbit the earth, John and his wife were cheered in a ticker-tape parade in New York City. Celebrity pursued them relentlessly and each brush with the media and famous people painfully revealed Annie's stuttering.
 With reporters in tow after the flight, then-Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson was intent on visiting the Glenns at their Arlington, Va., home, but John angered Johnson by refusing to receive him, proffering the excuse that Annie was in bed with a migraine to spare her from the attention. Even so, the Glenns became good friends with Johnson and his wife, Lady Bird.
 They also became close to former Attorney General Bobby Kennedy and his wife, Ethel. Annie was especially fond of Bobby because of the warmth and patience he showed when they conversed. During Kennedy's presidential run in 1968, the Glenns were with him the night he was murdered in Los Angeles, and Ethel asked John and Annie to fly with their children back to Virginia.
 Annie remembered being afraid to use the telephone and worried that she wouldn't be able to summon help if her children were hurt, and she said that "microphones paralyzed me." Yet when her husband was unable to campaign for the U.S. Senate in 1964 after a near-fatal head-banging fall in his Columbus bathroom, Annie bravely hit the campaign trail on his behalf, taking along Rene Carpenter, a close friend and wife of astronaut Scott Carpenter, to be her voice.
 Through the years, Annie tried different treatment programs, but none worked until she and John, watching the Today Show one morning in 1973, heard Dr. Ronald Webster, a psychologist and director of the Communications Research Institute at Hollins College in Roanoke, Va., describe a new treatment he had developed for stutterers. After three weeks away from John, Annie called him from Hollins. For the first time in 53 years, she did something she had never done before: She spoke a complete sentence without stuttering. Her husband wept.
 By 1984, Annie was delivering speeches across the country on behalf of her husband's short-lived presidential candidacy, and she devoted herself to helping other stutterers and people with disabilities. In 1983, she received the first national award of the American Speech and Hearing Association for "providing an inspiring model for people with communicative disorders." In 1987, the National Association for Hearing and Speech Action honored her by asking her to present the first annual Annie Glenn Award for achieving distinction despite a communicative disorder.
 Roughly a decade ago, Annie, in her 80s, was invited to lecture a speech-and- hearing class at Ohio State University. Facing the students, she finally had realized her dream of being a teacher. "The tears were rolling down my cheeks," she later told The Dispatch.
 A memorial service is being planned in Columbus.

Business leaders should regard this as a serious problem. Unaddressed mental health conditions cost U.S. companies nearly $17 billion per year in productivity loss. In terms of hiring and retention, younger employees in particular are demanding change: 50% of millennials and 75% of Gen Z employees have left a prior role for mental health reasons — compared to 34% overall. These are numbers we expect rise in light of Covid-19. In a recent survey of 1,200 U.S. employees, almost 70% of workers said that the pandemic has been the most stressful time of their careers, and in study of 2,700 global employees, more than 40% said their mental health has declined since the outbreak.

A top South Korean football club accused of using sex dolls to fill empty seats in its stands will face disciplinary proceedings this week, K-league officials said.
 With fans banned from matches because of the coronavirus, FC Seoul came under fire for deploying dozens of silicone spectators wearing T-shirts or holding placards with the logo of a sex-toy seller.
 The K-league said its disciplinary committee will review whether the use of the mannequins violated the league's rules on promoting obscene materials.
 Officials will also discuss whether the incident damaged the league's image and integrity.
 Violating those rules can result in five league points being deducted, or a fine of more than five million won ($4 066).
 FC Seoul - who beat Gwangju FC 1-0 in the match - apologised earlier this week for causing "deep concern" to fans, but has insisted the mannequins had no connection to sex toys.
 Reports say the mannequin distributor approached the K-league offering to provide its products to fill empty stands for free, and was introduced to FC Seoul.
 The club is considering legal action against the mannequin provider, according to Korean news reports, but regardless of the motive the stunt has made headlines around the world.
 The K-league's new season kicked off behind closed doors on 8 May after being postponed for more than two months because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 Clubs have used cardboard cut-outs, placards and banners to fill up the stands.
