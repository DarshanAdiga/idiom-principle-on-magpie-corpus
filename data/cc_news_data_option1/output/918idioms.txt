The nationwide action she supports was published in 2017 by Reagan-era cabinet members James Baker and George Shultz and six other authors, and proposes a carbon tax of $40 per ton that would gradually go up in order to drive down fossil fuel demand and spur clean energy innovation. To help cover the higher costs of fuel, the tax would pay the average American family around $2,000 a year in dividend and slap a "border adjustment" on the cost of imported fossil fuel to urge other nations to fall in line.

The critical message to digest from the Microsoft deep dive into this threat is that not all ransomware is the same. The automated, bot-driven worm-like ransomware that spits out across the interwebs like a cyber-blunderbuss is damaging enough, for sure. However, the Microsoft threat protection intelligence team is warning about the type of hands-on, human-operated, highly targeted threat that is more commonly associated with the credential- stealing and data exfiltration antics of nation-state actors. Indeed, there is a similarity beyond the targeting; some of these ransomware attack methodologies have evolved to exfiltrate as well as encrypt data. DoppelPaymer, which recently hit the headlines when I reported how Lockheed Martin, SpaceX and Tesla had all been caught in the crossfire of one cyber- attack on a business in their supply chains, is an excellent example of the breed. More of that in a moment, though. First, let's look at the attack tactics and techniques Microsoft is alerting users to.

HECKER, Ill. -- The first fingernail tattoo started off as a joke by a man who lost the tips of two fingers in a construction accident in 2018.      But that shifted after Eric Catalano, an auto finance manager turned tattoo artist, finished with his needle.   "The mood changed in here," Catalano recalled as he stood in his Eternal Ink Tattoo Studio. "Everything turned from funny to wow."      When Catalano posted a photo of the inked fingernails online last January, he thought maybe 300 people would like the realistic tattoo. He had no idea the image would be viewed by millions of people around the world. Even "Ripley's Believe It or Not!" tracked him down to feature the viral tattoo: a pair of fingernails that looked so real no one could believe their eyes.      The viral photo pushed Catalano, 39, further into the world of paramedical tattooing. Now people with life-altering scars come from as far as Ireland to visit Catalano's tattoo shop in this rural village about 30 miles outside St. Louis. They enter Eternal Ink looking for the healing touch they saw online. With flesh-toned ink and a needle, Catalano makes his clients feel whole again with an art form and industry that picks up where doctors leave off.      Catalano is known for his talent with intricate fingernails and filling in the blanks left empty by accidents or surgeries, but other paramedical tattoo artists also are trying out flesh-toned pigments to camouflage imperfections, scars and discolorations for all skin colors.      Using tattoos to blend in rather than stand out is a relatively new field. A school started outside Atlanta about four years ago has trained more than 100 aspiring paramedical tattoo artists.      Because the work is considered cosmetic, though, it typically isn't covered by medical insurance. Still, the mostly unregulated industry continues to grow even as health care professionals debate the safety of tattoo ink. Many people are willing to pay out-of-pocket for that final piece of healing.      Leslie Pollan, 32, a stay-at-home mom and dog breeder in Oxford, Mississippi, feels this service is priceless. She was bitten on the face by a puppy in 2014. She underwent countless surgeries to correct a scar on her lip.      "I went to plastic surgeons that were supposed to be the best in Memphis," Pollan said. "They gave me no hope, so I started looking for other options."      She ultimately traveled six hours for a paramedical tattoo session with Catalano. He used ink and his tattoo needle to camouflage Pollan's lip scar, giving her back a piece of her confidence.      "You don't understand until you've been through it," Pollan said. "It really made me have a different outlook on life."      A Booming Business   More than 500 miles from Catalano's shop, industry expert and paramedical tattoo trainer Feleshia Sams, 41, shows artists and health professionals how to cover stretch marks, surgery scars and discolored skin with flesh-toned pigment in the course she launched at the Academy of Advanced Cosmetics in Alpharetta, Georgia.      While a tattoo license is required for such work, separate paramedical tattoo training is not.      Catalano is self-taught. He uses the techniques he picked up years ago while helping breast cancer survivors who wanted tattoos of areolas -- the dark area around nipples -- after having mastectomies. Those tattoos are among the most common paramedical requests.      His grandmother had breast cancer. Her battle with the disease is one reason Catalano is so dedicated to helping those with the diagnosis.      "Cancer took away a part of my body I can never get back," said Sarah Penberthy, a breast cancer survivor who came from Festus, Missouri, for areola tattoos. "I felt like I wasn't even human."      Penberthy, 39, said she was grateful for her life but still felt incomplete until Catalano stepped in. He tattooed nipples and a creative design of a ship's anchor on her chest that says "I REFUSE TO SINK."      Catalano now does up to eight reconstructive tattoos each "Wellness Wednesday," drawing in nail beds on finger amputees and mocking up belly buttons after tummy tucks.      Catalano doesn't charge for paramedical tattoos. A GoFundMe page established last year brought in more than $12,000, allowing Catalano to donate his skills for the time being.

Still, the makers of The Burnt Orange Heresy, directed by Giuseppe Capotondi from a script that Scott B. Smith adapted from the 1971 novel by crime writer Charles Willeford, have provided a plot that needlessly spoils most of the indecent fun. Switching locations from Florida to Italy is not the problem. It's the growing heaviness of the narrative. That's when Cassidy hatches a plan to have Figueras snatch a painting from Jerome Debney (Donald Sutherland at his buoyant best), a recluse who hasn't practiced his art in years. A fire destroyed his previous lifetime output — but he may be creating new work at a studio that's coincidentally tucked away on Cassidy's estate. Debney takes quite a shine to Hollis, paving the way for light-fingered critic/con artist to get close and the script to swerve in directions that don't exactly re- invent the film-noir playbook. Bang and Debicki go through the motions as the story that gets lost in the familiar corners of arson, forgery, betrayal and murder.

The Microsoft researchers found that these ransomware campaigns do not bother too much with a stealthy approach; if they can get into your networks, then they operate without worrying about covering their tracks. Perhaps even more surprising to many, will be that the attacks themselves start in an unsophisticated manner, employing commodity malware and using vectors that routinely trigger detection alerts in business systems. They don't care because the warnings are low level, with security teams determining them to be of little importance and so get left uninvestigated in a timely fashion, if at all. This opens the attack window for long enough to enable the attacker to jump right through it. Even if a common payload gets intercepted by the security solution in place, the attack will simply try others until one sneaks through the defenses. They will even, having got admin status on a system, disable antivirus protection to enable relatively unfettered payload action.

Hana Elion and JJ Mitchell of Overcoats have always made songs with a decidedly sororal harmony; theirs is music of empowerment through thick and thin. But where the folksy electro of 2017’s _YOUNG_ proved to be deft art- pop, _The Fight_ looks to be the moment where the New York born and bred duo unfurls into a full-blown pop sensation. With the help of producers Justin Raisen (Angel Olsen, Kim Gordon) and Yves Rothman (Miya Folick, Freya Ridings), Overcoats have crafted singles like the layered, decadent and choral “The Fool” and the absolutely explosive, guitar-heavy “Keep The Faith.” “We realized the thing to do is not to wait for life to get easier, but to start fighting harder,” the pair said in a release, and I’ll be damned if this maxim isn’t bursting through all of Overcoats’ new material. _—Adrian Spinelli_

Today, most autonomous vehicles rely on multiple sensors to perceive the world. Most systems use a combination of cameras, radar sensors and LiDAR (light detection and ranging) sensors. On board, computers fuse this data to create a comprehensive view of what's happening around the car. Without this data, autonomous vehicles would have no hope of safely navigating the world. Cars that use multiple sensor systems both work better and are safer - each system can serve as a check on the others - but no system is immune from attack.

And we were all riveted by headlines about the college admissions scandal, which was quickly turned into a Lifetime movie, and fake heiress Anna Delvey, whose story is being developed into TV shows by HBO and Netflix. These tales offered a juicy distraction from the quote-unquote real news but also tapped into “eat the rich” rage.
 “These kinds of stories of extreme hubris inspire a lot of schadenfreude,” says Victoria Thompson, co-writer and co-producer of “The Dropout,” a podcast about Holmes which is being adapted developed into a TV show for Hulu, “and it’s kind of a satisfying ending when they see this perfect veneer cracked.”
 But if the alleged schemes that grabbed our attention throughout 2019 are aspirational and distinctly millennial in flavor, concerned with the manipulative powers of social media and the fake-it-til-you-make-it culture of Silicon Valley, our scam obsession is now entering a normcore phase. Gone are the college dropouts promising to revolutionize healthcare, the phony socialites swindling free rides on private jets, the sitcom actresses buying their kids into top universities in order to “build their brand.”
 They’ve been replaced by working stiffs with piles of debt who, quite understandably, just want to make a quick buck.
 While “Quiz” is a fact-based dramatization boasting a prestigious pedigree (Frears is a two-time Oscar nominee, Graham a Tony-nominated playwright) and “McMillions” a documentary made by previously unknown directors, the similarities between the stories — and the ways in which they are told — are illuminating.
 Both are set in the period around 9/11, with pivotal events unfolding on the literal eve of the attacks — an event that would immediately, if not permanently, pry our attention away from the trivial and the tawdry. Charles Ingram taped the winning episode of “Millionaire” on Sept. 10, 2001, while halfway around the world, the FBI was making arrests in the Monopoly fraud case. (The FBI’s investigation was known internally by a code name, Operation Final Answer, inspired by — you guessed it — “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?”)

Still, the makers of _The Burnt Orange Heresy,_ directed by Giuseppe Capotondi from a script that Scott B. Smith adapted from the 1971 novel by crime writer Charles Willeford, have provided a plot that needlessly spoils most of the indecent fun. Switching locations from Florida to Italy is not the problem. It's the growing heaviness of the narrative. That's when Cassidy hatches a plan to have Figueras snatch a painting from Jerome Debney (Donald Sutherland at his buoyant best), a recluse who hasn't practiced his art in years. A fire destroyed his previous lifetime output -- but he may be creating new work at a studio that's coincidentally tucked away on Cassidy's estate. Debney takes quite a shine to Hollis, paving the way for light-fingered critic/con artist to get close and the script to swerve in directions that don't exactly re- invent the film-noir playbook. Bang and Debicki go through the motions as the story that gets lost in the familiar corners of arson, forgery, betrayal and murder.
