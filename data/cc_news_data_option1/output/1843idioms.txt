Screen Space Reflections (SSR) have been the go-to for quite some time now and are still heavily used despite moving into the ability to render real-time reflections, but SSR is far from perfect. FidelityFX Stochastic Screen Space Reflections (SSSR) takes aim to improve the quality of SSR by leaps and bounds by being able to add in varying roughness to reflective surfaces, think ripples in water, or dimples in metallic surfaces.

Besides targeting an attorney general, the smear campaign demonstrates that there is something rotten in the State of Israel.
 Although Blue and White leader Benny Gantz has now reneged on his pledge not to sit in the same government as an indicted prime minister, in the interests of national unity during the coronavirus pandemic, we urge him to take a firm stand against the campaign to smear the attorney general and his good offices.
 With members of the new government due to take their oaths of office this week, we also appeal to them - and especially the new justice minister, Avi Nissenkorn - to fully back Mandelblit and appoint a new state attorney who will uphold the rule of law.
 The rule of law is a fundamental principle of a democratic state such as Israel. If Netanyahu is innocent, as he proclaims repeatedly, let him prove this before the Jerusalem District Court. Turning the attorney general into a scapegoat ahead of his trial sets a dangerous precedent and is a preview of what is likely to come once the trial officially begins.
 Before it gets out of hand, Netanyahu should put an immediate halt to the campaign by members of his government and his political party assailing the country's judicial authorities and their personnel. On the contrary, they should be showing respect to a fair legal system that is a source of pride for all Israelis. After all, it is this same legal system that cleared Netanyahu last week to form the new government even though he is facing severe corruption charges.
 As the ruling party, the Likud should remember its late leader Menachem Begin's famous line, "There are judges in Jerusalem." There is room for criticism, but launching attacks like the one against Mandelblit has the potential to erode the rule of law in Israel and lead the country to a state of anarchy. That cannot be allowed to happen.

Contact tracing allows public health officials to figure out where someone who has COVID-19 has been and who they have been in contact with, making it a crucial piece of information in determining where health officials should look when trying to limit the spread of the disease.
 Although the application is in its pilot stage at this point, the process of doing contact tracing is not new, according to Arona.
 “The whole contact tracing (concept) is the same thing as what public health has done all along,” she said. “(The application is) just a tool that aids us in doing that. We used to have to call every single person, every single day to monitor their progress, and this app is good tool to use where it’s more interactive with the public.”
