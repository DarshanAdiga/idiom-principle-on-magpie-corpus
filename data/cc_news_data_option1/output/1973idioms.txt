Trump has promised to build 450 miles of wall along the border with Mexico by the end of the year. So far, the government has awarded millions of dollars in contracts for construction of 30-foot-tall barriers, along with new lighting, technology and infrastructure. The Trump administration says it has already built 187 miles of wall. Some of it is new, but most is replacing old, much shorter barriers that officials say were not sufficient.

Paul Dunlop Fairleigh passed away Monday, May 11th after a valiant battle with colon cancer. His last hours were spent holding hands with his wife Stephanie and daughter Lily. Paul was born December 29, 1961 in Houston, Texas to James Fairleigh and Ishbel Dunlop Fairleigh. His family moved to Friendswood, Texas where he graduated from Friendswood HS. Paul earned a B.S. in Advertising from the University of Texas at Austin and his M.B.A. from the University of Houston-Clear Lake. After graduating, Paul and Stephanie moved to New York City in 1989 where he began his career at Ogilvy and Mather Direct Advertising. Subsequently he worked at FCB Direct then focused on credit card and related product marketing at Chemical Bank (later Chase Manhattan). Paul spent 13 years as an executive with MasterCard in Purchase. His last position was in business development at Charter Communications in Stamford. Paul and Stephanie were married in 1996 and moved to Darien in 1999, and their daughter Lily was born in 2001. Paul's greatest joy was watching Lily dance in Nutcracker performances and recitals, play viola in the DHS chamber orchestra and compete for the Blue Wave and Darien YMCA house gymnastics teams. Paul also coached Lily's Darien Little League softball teams for many years. He was extremely proud of her accomplishments as an artist and excited for her future as she began studying animation at SVA in NYC. Paul was a member of the Advisory Board for the New Covenant Center, a volunteer at Stamford Hospital and a recovered alcoholic who found great strength through his friends and sponsors in AA. The family belonged to the Stamford Yacht Club for many years where he enjoyed sailing, paddle tennis and skeet shooting. He was a member of the Descendants of San Jacinto, the Sons of the Republic of Texas and the Texas Exes as an ardent fan of the Texas Longhorns. In addition to his wife and daughter, Paul is survived by his father, James Franklin Fairleigh of Friendswood, Texas; his sisters Margaret Lucia of Alvin, Texas and Martha Runco of San Rafael, California, and his many beloved nieces and nephews. A celebration of Paul's life will be held at a future date. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests a gift in his honor to the New Covenant Center, www.newcovenantcenter.org, or to the Darien YMCA house gymnastics team through www.darien-ymca.org.

Kinderhook, NY - Joseph Anthony Cutro Sr., Esq. was born in Manhattan, NYC, on the 5th of January, 1926 to Italian-American parents, Vincenzo (James) Cutro and Flora Mulinio Cutro, both children of Sicilian immigrants through Ellis Island. After his parents divorced in 1933, his time was spent primarily with his father, paternal aunts (Agnes and Mildred) and grandfather (Joseph) in Brooklyn while frequently visiting his mother and her family upstate in Troy, NY. He was close to his grandfather in early childhood, playing cards and helping to crush grapes for wine in his bathtub. His father remarried and his brother James Jr. was born in 1938.   He attended PS163 Elementary in Brooklyn and was later the only student in his class to pass the entrance exam for Stuyvesant High School (Manhattan) where, among other aspects of an accelerated curriculum, he learned to speak German, a skill he sometimes jokingly referred to as "hedging his bets" in the war against Hitler's Germany. His German language skills would later prove useful in his military service. An avid fan of baseball and the Brooklyn Dodgers, he threw a mean knuckleball and was an outstanding pitcher for his high school team, as well as for the Kodiaks, a Brooklyn league team. His brother Jim fondly recalls, "He taught me everything I know about sports and competing." He was also a huge fan of jazz and swing and played the tenor sax in the Stuyvesant band. He loved to recount his notorious jaunts to shows at the celebrated Paramount Theater in Manhattan while his father thought he was in school.   He graduated high school in June 1944 and enlisted in the US Army in July. Driven by his passion to serve, he intentionally hid his missing left kidney during his induction physical. In November 1944 after basic training, he was deployed to LaHarve, France with the 394th Regiment of the 99th Division. His active combat service would include surviving the freezing conditions at Elsenborn Ridge, arriving at the Battle of the Bulge on January 10, 1945, where his unit was strategic in blocking Nazi access to Belgium in the Ardennes Forest. He served in a machine gun unit and as a password runner. In March 1945, he crossed the Ludendorf Bridge at Remagen between timed sequences of German artillery, which signaled the beginning of the end of World War II and the start of the Allied occupation of Germany. Once inside Germany, while still a teenager, he experienced the horror and pain of witnessing Nazi Death Camps and liberating their remaining survivors. This experience, more than any other from the war, would haunt him for the rest of his life. For the remainder of his tour of duty, his high school German came in handy in connecting with the locals until he was shipped home. He was honorably discharged from the US Army on July 8, 1946, receiving the Bronze Star, American Campaign, WWII Victory, Army of Occupation and African Middle Eastern Campaign medals for his service.   Upon returning home, utilizing the G.I. Bill, he attended Brooklyn College and St. John's Law School. His law career included over 20 years of civil service as a NY State Assistant Attorney General under Louis J. Lefkowitz; private sector service for the law firm of Max E. Greenberg in Lower Manhattan; a return to civil service as President of the NYS Environmental Facilities Corp., and Town Justice for the Town of Kinderhook, NY and then private practice from his home in Kinderhook until retirement. His private law career included a multimillion dollar wrongful death judgment for the families of multiple homicide victims, rendered uncollectable by the imprisonment of the responsible party.   Joe was a talented storyteller and had a laugh (and a sneeze) you could hear down the street. His sense of humor and passion for history and politics would always make for compelling conversation and learning. Having grown up in Brooklyn, he would tell colorful stories of childhood classmates who started with mischief and progressed to infamous careers in organized crime. His war experiences sparked an interest in German automobiles and their design. His first project was the restoration of a 1956 VW followed by a 1959 Mercedes 219 sedan which he owned until his passing. He and his beloved wife Angela (d. 2017) spent much of their spare time restoring, renovating and enjoying their farmhouse in Kinderhook along with entertaining friends, dear neighbors, devoted caregivers and beloved family. He was a great dancer and Angie often said she could dance just fine, but only when he was her lead. As Town Justice he married many couples, often in his own home with Angie delighted to set the stage for the happy couple. He was always willing to lend a hand to anyone in need and was never afraid to answer the door in the middle of the night.   In adult life, Joe resided in the Albia area of Troy, NY until 1972 when he moved to Scotch Plains, NJ and then back upstate to Kinderhook in 1977 where he resided until 2015. He then moved to a skilled nursing unit at the VA Hospital in Bedford, MA, where he continued to enjoy outings with family, baseball games at Fenway, live jazz clubs, and dinner dates and movies with Angie until her passing in 2017. Thereafter, he continued to be a cherished and welcome presence in his family's lives, at family gatherings, sharing holidays at home with his young grandsons and daughter in Somerville, MA, and passing on his stories, love of baseball and jazz to the newest generation. He passed away from complications of Covid-19 at Lahey Hospital and Medical Center in Burlington, MA. on April 28, 2020.   He was a loving husband, father, brother, grandfather, war hero, and a piece of living history. We, his family, are grateful for his long, loving, and honorable life of service, and we will miss him every day.   He is survived by his 3 loving children, John M. Cutro (m. Anne Liske), Albany, NY, Janet A. Cutro, Somerville, MA, and Joseph A. Cutro Jr., Issaquah, WA, brother James Cutro Jr. (m. Linda Cutro), Westfield, NJ, 5 grandchildren; Nina Cutro-Kelly, Moriah Cutro-Kelly, Galen Cutro-Kelly, Pietro (Pete) Cutro and Steve Cutro, several nieces, nephews and loving friends and colleagues.   Because of the pandemic, the family was unable to hold visitation hours or funeral services. He is buried with his wife, Angela, the love of his life, at Gerald B.H. Solomon Saratoga National Cemetery. Military honors will be rescheduled at a later time and will be announced to the public. To sign the guest book or light a candle, visit www.brycefh.com.

“Coronavirus has piled more misery on the region where the people, under a new lockdown, have had restrictions tightened further. India is behaving like a Mafia Cartel in Kashmir. It decides the fate of eight million people with a stroke of a pen. This is nothing but a broad daylight robbery,” said a top businessman in main Srinagar city who declined to be identified, citing reprisals. India-occupied Kashmir is considered to be the most militarised place in the world, with New Delhi deploying more than 500,000 troops and paramilitaries, a further 100,000 Indian police and about 30,000 SPOs (special police officers) have been added to add to the woes of Kashmiris. Pro-freedom groups and rights activists say the ruling Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) plans to implement a “demographic change” by settling army officers, bureaucrats, migrant labourers and even nomadic slum dwellers in the region.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s longtime personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen will be released from federal prison Thursday and is expected to serve the remainder of his sentence at home, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press.Cohen has been serving a federal prison sentence at FCI Otisville in New York after pleading guilty to numerous charges, including campaign finance fraud and lying to Congress.He will be released on furlough with the expectation that he will transition to home confinement to serve the remainder of his sentence at home, the person said. Cohen, 53, began serving his sentence last May and was scheduled to be released from prison in November 2021.The person could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.Prison advocates and congressional leaders have been pressing the Justice Department for weeks to release at-risk inmates ahead of a potential outbreak, arguing that the public health guidance to stay 6 feet (1.8 meters) away from other people is nearly impossible behind bars.Attorney General William Barr ordered the Bureau of Prisons in March and April to increase the use of home confinement and expedite the release of eligible high-risk inmates, beginning at three prisons identified as coronavirus hot spots. Otisville is not one of those facilities.Cohen was told last month he would be released to serve the rest of his three-year sentence at home in response to concerns about coronavirus. He had told associates he was expecting to be released earlier this month.The Bureau of Prisons has placed him on furlough as it continues to process a move to home confinement, the person familiar with the matter said. The agency has the authority to release inmates on furlough for up to 30 days and has been doing so to make sure suitable inmates, who are expected to transition to home confinement, can be moved out of correctional facilities sooner, the person said.A federal judge had denied Cohen’s attempt for an early release to home confinement after serving 10 months in prison and said in a ruling earlier this month that it “appears to be just another effort to inject himself into the news cycle.” But the Bureau of Prisons can take action to move him to home confinement without a judicial order.The Bureau of Prisons said last week that more than 2,400 inmates had been moved to home confinement since Barr first issued his memo on home confinement in late March, and 1,200 others had been approved and were expected to be released in the coming weeks.Other high-profile inmates have also been released as the number of coronavirus cases soars in the federal prison system. Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was released on home confinement last week. Michael Avenatti, the attorney who rose to fame representing porn star Stormy Daniels in lawsuits against Trump, was temporarily freed from a federal jail in New York City and is staying at a friend’s house in Los Angeles.Former New York state Senate leader Dean Skelos, 72, who was also serving a sentence at Otisville, was released on home confinement after testing positive for the coronavirus.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Idaho election officials botched the mail-in primary process, a Republican candidate seeking to represent the state in Congress says, and has filed a federal lawsuit seeking to extend the deadline for requesting a ballot until next week. Nicholas Jones in the lawsuit filed Tuesday said the secretary of state’s website became overwhelmed and failed to meet the demand for ballot requests as the 8 p.m. Tuesday deadline loomed, denying some people their only opportunity to prepare to vote. Jones in the lawsuit filed against Idaho Secretary of State Lawerence Denney asks for the deadline to be extended until 8 p.m. Tuesday. Jones, who owns several board game shops and burger eateries, is challenging first-term Republican U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher. Idaho shifted to its first-ever entirely mail-in primary this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Elections officials said they couldn't secure in-person voting venues or enough volunteers. Denney’s office said Wednesday that election officials had not yet reviewed Jones' lawsuit and had no immediate comment. Deputy Secretary of State Chad Houck said in an interview last week that participation in the primary was strong, “looking like equal or better than the presidential primary” in March. Jones' lawsuit said if the extension for requesting ballots is not granted, “qualified electors will be deprived of a meaningful opportunity to exercise their right to vote.” A U.S. Senate seat, another U.S. House of Representatives seat and all 70 seats in the Idaho House and 35 in the Idaho Senate are on the ballot this year. Many of the races are uncontested. ___ This story, headline and summary have been corrected to say Jones is a Republican, not a Democrat.

The Daily News verifies and reviews all letters to the editor we receive. The letters represent the views of the letter writers, not those of the Daily News.
 Right now residents of Massachusetts (and some other states) have been under lockdown for two months enforced by decrees issued by the governor, mayors and other public officials. While the decrees have some authority behind them, most are probably unconstitutional and the longer the lockdown continues, the more time those adversely affected (which is most of us) have time to go to federal courts and have them nullified.
 The wording on some of them is nebulous. Wear a mask out in public. What is public? What occupations are essential? Social distancing? How about fines for going about unmasked? How about public meetings where the public is not allowed to attend?
 What was probably advice has been turned into law. Most of us are not stupid and know the risks involved when there is possible danger. If we have a major snowstorm, most people do not have to be told to stay home for the day. Most of us knew how to avoid people who coughed, sneezed and wheezed at work. In fact most of the coughers, wheezers and sneezers stayed home.
 Even generations long past knew risks if a quarantine flag was flying. Most avoided the place.
 Humanity has endured and survived far deadlier diseases than the coronavirus, some of them even in American cities. Europe survived several bouts of bubonic plague and even the United States withstood outbreaks of smallpox, cholera and yellow fever. Some people died, some got it and recovered and others were not affected.
 We have been told the lockdown was to save lives. This pronouncement of course is from the political establishment that while shedding crocodile tears for the coronavirus deaths, has been trying to enact a bill legalizing assisted suicide - death by appointment if you are terminally ill, which some of the COVID-19 cases are - and already has legalized the killing of about-to be-born babies.
 On the note of essential: apparently Boston's Mayor Walsh, state Sen. Karen Spilka, Govs. Whitmer (Michigan), Newsom (California) and Murphy (New Jersey) have all found essential stylists or barbers to keep well coiffed and U. S. House Speaker Pelosi has likewise and also found an essential Botoxer. End the lockdown.

“They run an offense around what they have to do and what I like to do,” Pigrome told the Daily News in a phone interview Wednesday. “Just make me the best me. I can run and throw. People don’t know that I want to sit in the pocket. I’m just going to show what I can do.”
 WKU announced the addition of Pigrome over the weekend, bringing much-needed experience to a quarterback room that lacks it. The Hilltoppers are down two quarterbacks from the 2019 roster with the graduation of Ty Storey, who was also a grad transfer, and Steven Duncan, who transferred to Tarleton State. Both were the only quarterbacks to play last fall, which leaves the future of the offense in the hands of the unproven.
 Pigrome completed 58 percent of his passes last season for the Terrapins against Big Ten defenses. WKU’s offense last season under head coach Tyson Helton and offensive coordinator Bryan Ellis allowed Storey to lead Conference USA with a 70 percent completion rate with easy routes and a veteran offensive line.
 “I’m comfortable,” Pigrome said. “We’ll be able to show that as the season starts, I’ll be able to do whatever they need me to do. That’s the best situation I could be in. I have better opportunities.”
 Pigrome said his time at Maryland was filled with ups and downs which ultimately led to his decision to transfer upon graduation. Ellis remembered recruiting Pigrome out of Birmingham, Ala., to WKU before his profile took off out Clay-Chalkville High School. He won a pair of state titles and was the 2015 Gatorade Alabama Player of the Year and played with current WKU wide receiver Xavier Lane in the Alabama/Mississippi All-Star Game. Pigrome actually took a visit to WKU during that time when Ellis was previously an assistant to former coach Jeff Brohm.
 Four years at Maryland came with seven total starts and 34 appearances where he accumulated 2,407 total yards. As the Terps' starter for the 2017 season at Texas, Pigrome suffered a season-ending leg injury after throwing for two touchdowns and rushing for 64 yards and a score.

He likened it to the case of Mary Mallon, aka Typhoid Mary, a New York City cook who was asymptomatic for typhoid but allegedly gave it to 53 people between 1900 and 1915. Mallon was quarantined twice, the first time between 1907 and 1910. After she was released she changed her name and went back to being a cook. Of the 53 people who caught typhoid from her, at least three died. She was caught again in 1915 and remained in quarantine for the rest of her life, dying in 1938.
 "There are many 'Typhoid Marys' among us," Polis said. A person could be contagious for a week or three weeks.
 He said there's no substitute for social distancing efforts, such as wearing a mask, because there's always a danger from someone who doesn't know they're infected with COVID-19.
 Dr. Samuel Dominguez of Children's Hospital said COVID-19 doesn't impact children as severely as adults, and that the emergence of MISC is quite rare. But it does a lot of damage; most cases show up about four weeks after a child has been exposed to the virus.
 It appears to be an inflammatory response to the virus rather than part of ongoing damage from the virus itself. Children with MISC have very high fevers for multiple days, gastrointestinal complaints, severe abdominal pain and diarrhea, as well as inflammation of the heart muscle.
 A second inflammatory disease, Kawasaki disease, which is also tied to COVID-19, affects younger children, while MISC appears to impact children ages five to 15, Dominguez said.
 With Memorial Day just days away, Polis cautioned people to take it easy for the upcoming holiday. "It's not a vacation, it's a global pandemic and treat it as such," he said.

The way Prime Minister Imran Khan has exposed the RSS inspired Hindutva mindset of BJP government and highlighted the lingering Kashmir dispute before the world has really baffled the Indians. In a series of tweets on Sunday, the Prime Minister once again drew attention towards the Indian atrocities in occupied Jammu and Kashmir and warned that India is busy in getting prepared for false flag operation to divert world attention from the situation in occupied territory. Indeed the situation in the occupied territory is very serious since the people there who are under lockdown since August last year has no access to medical supplies and treatment. Nobody exactly knows how far the contagion has affected the population there due to lack of testing facilities. Ever since coming to power, Modi has proved one thing very crystal clear that he harbours no good for Pakistan and the Muslim population either it lives in occupied Jammu and Kashmir or India. He has used every occasion to malign Pakistan at the international forums but miserably failed to isolate the neighbouring country. It was out of desperation that he staged a drama in February last year of attacking a terrorist facility inside Pakistan and whole world saw the place hit by the Indian fighter jets destroyed nothing but a few trees. Then how our Shaheens responded to the Indian aggression and shot down their two aircraft will always remain part of history. India will make a big mistake if it once again opted for aggression against Pakistan. Despite engaged with anti-Corona activities, our armed forces backed by the entire nation are fully prepared to once again force the enemy bite the dust. The world needs to rise from the slumber and take serious notice of Indian atrocities in the IoK as well as demonization and massacre of Muslims in India who are being targeted under one pretext or another.

He appeared in 11 games each of the last two years, starting three of them last fall. One of his highlights came against Brohm-coached Purdue with 218 passing yards and 107 rushing yards.
 Ellis said he recently heard from Nick Holt, Purdue’s defensive coordinator at the time and also former defensive coordinator at WKU who worked with Ellis. Holt raved about the 5-foot-10 quarterback’s talent and ability to scramble. Ellis said his passing ability gets overshadowed by his running skills.
 “I really think he’s an underrated passer as well,” Ellis said. “He’s a 58 percent completion guy in the Big Ten. That’s not terrible. You’d like to be a little higher than that, but that’s far from bad. We will do everything we can offensively, assuming he wins the job like we do all our QBs, we’ll tailor it to fit his skill set. We’re really excited to have him on board, that’s for sure.”
 Pigrome said Ellis, Helton and new quarterbacks coach Ryan Aplin were aggressive in recruiting him once he hit the transfer portal in February. That and Ellis’ and Helton’s strong recruiting connections with relationships formed in the Birmingham area helped get Pigrome to sign with WKU last week.
 “Other schools, they weren’t as consistent as Western Kentucky,” Pigrome said. “They were loyal. Other staff from other schools, they had maybe one or two (coaches). WKU was about four or five coaches. You could see they cared about the team. It was about loyalty. They’re big on family and that’s the good thing on that.”
 Pigrome automatically brings the most experience to WKU’s quarterback room that includes redshirt junior Davis Shanley, redshirt sophomore Kevaris Thomas and incoming freshmen Darius Ocean and Grady Robison. Of those four, only Shanley has legitimate quarterback playing time in his sporadic starts and appearances during the 2018 season.
 “I’m not too worried about him picking up the offense,” Ellis said of Pigrome. “If he’s the QB and he ends up winning the job, we’ll do what he does and do what he does well. I think sometimes that learning the offense is a little overrated. What he does pick up and what he does learn, when that starts back, he’ll be fine.”
 Pigrome is still living in Maryland and will join the team once certain restrictions are lifted in response to the coronavirus pandemic. As of now, the season is scheduled to start Sept. 5 at home against UT-Chattanooga. WKU is set to visit Pigrome’s hometown of Birmingham to play UAB on Oct. 17.
 “I’ve just been working to keep throwing, making sure my body is in shape,” Pigrome said. “Now I just have to get to the playbook. Coach Ellis just sent it out to me, so we’re starting that up. … I feel like (the team) is working and I’m working. When we get together, we’ll just have to do it together and build a team bond.”

Kinderhook, NY - Joseph Anthony Cutro Sr., Esq. was born in Manhattan, NYC, on the 5th of January, 1926 to Italian-American parents, Vincenzo (James) Cutro and Flora Mulinio Cutro, both children of Sicilian immigrants through Ellis Island. After his parents divorced in 1933, his time was spent primarily with his father, paternal aunts (Agnes and Mildred) and grandfather (Joseph) in Brooklyn while frequently visiting his mother and her family upstate in Troy, NY. He was close to his grandfather in early childhood, playing cards and helping to crush grapes for wine in his bathtub. His father remarried and his brother James Jr. was born in 1938.He attended PS163 Elementary in Brooklyn and was later the only student in his class to pass the entrance exam for Stuyvesant High School (Manhattan) where, among other aspects of an accelerated curriculum, he learned to speak German, a skill he sometimes jokingly referred to as "hedging his bets" in the war against Hitler's Germany. His German language skills would later prove useful in his military service. An avid fan of baseball and the Brooklyn Dodgers, he threw a mean knuckleball and was an outstanding pitcher for his high school team, as well as for the Kodiaks, a Brooklyn league team. His brother Jim fondly recalls, "He taught me everything I know about sports and competing." He was also a huge fan of jazz and swing and played the tenor sax in the Stuyvesant band. He loved to recount his notorious jaunts to shows at the celebrated Paramount Theater in Manhattan while his father thought he was in school.He graduated high school in June 1944 and enlisted in the US Army in July. Driven by his passion to serve, he intentionally hid his missing left kidney during his induction physical. In November 1944 after basic training, he was deployed to LaHarve, France with the 394th Regiment of the 99th Division. His active combat service would include surviving the freezing conditions at Elsenborn Ridge, arriving at the Battle of the Bulge on January 10, 1945, where his unit was strategic in blocking Nazi access to Belgium in the Ardennes Forest. He served in a machine gun unit and as a password runner. In March 1945, he crossed the Ludendorf Bridge at Remagen between timed sequences of German artillery, which signaled the beginning of the end of World War II and the start of the Allied occupation of Germany. Once inside Germany, while still a teenager, he experienced the horror and pain of witnessing Nazi Death Camps and liberating their remaining survivors. This experience, more than any other from the war, would haunt him for the rest of his life. For the remainder of his tour of duty, his high school German came in handy in connecting with the locals until he was shipped home. He was honorably discharged from the US Army on July 8, 1946, receiving the Bronze Star, American Campaign, WWII Victory, Army of Occupation and African Middle Eastern Campaign medals for his service.Upon returning home, utilizing the G.I. Bill, he attended Brooklyn College and St. John's Law School. His law career included over 20 years of civil service as a NY State Assistant Attorney General under Louis J. Lefkowitz; private sector service for the law firm of Max E. Greenberg in Lower Manhattan; a return to civil service as President of the NYS Environmental Facilities Corp., and Town Justice for the Town of Kinderhook, NY and then private practice from his home in Kinderhook until retirement. His private law career included a multimillion dollar wrongful death judgment for the families of multiple homicide victims, rendered uncollectable by the imprisonment of the responsible party.Joe was a talented storyteller and had a laugh (and a sneeze) you could hear down the street. His sense of humor and passion for history and politics would always make for compelling conversation and learning. Having grown up in Brooklyn, he would tell colorful stories of childhood classmates who started with mischief and progressed to infamous careers in organized crime. His war experiences sparked an interest in German automobiles and their design. His first project was the restoration of a 1956 VW followed by a 1959 Mercedes 219 sedan which he owned until his passing. He and his beloved wife Angela (d. 2017) spent much of their spare time restoring, renovating and enjoying their farmhouse in Kinderhook along with entertaining friends, dear neighbors, devoted caregivers and beloved family. He was a great dancer and Angie often said she could dance just fine, but only when he was her lead. As Town Justice he married many couples, often in his own home with Angie delighted to set the stage for the happy couple. He was always willing to lend a hand to anyone in need and was never afraid to answer the door in the middle of the night.In adult life, Joe resided in the Albia area of Troy, NY until 1972 when he moved to Scotch Plains, NJ and then back upstate to Kinderhook in 1977 where he resided until 2015. He then moved to a skilled nursing unit at the VA Hospital in Bedford, MA, where he continued to enjoy outings with family, baseball games at Fenway, live jazz clubs, and dinner dates and movies with Angie until her passing in 2017. Thereafter, he continued to be a cherished and welcome presence in his family's lives, at family gatherings, sharing holidays at home with his young grandsons and daughter in Somerville, MA, and passing on his stories, love of baseball and jazz to the newest generation. He passed away from complications of Covid-19 at Lahey Hospital and Medical Center in Burlington, MA. on April 28, 2020.He was a loving husband, father, brother, grandfather, war hero, and a piece of living history. We, his family, are grateful for his long, loving, and honorable life of service, and we will miss him every day.He is survived by his 3 loving children, John M. Cutro (m. Anne Liske), Albany, NY, Janet A. Cutro, Somerville, MA, and Joseph A. Cutro Jr., Issaquah, WA, brother James Cutro Jr. (m. Linda Cutro), Westfield, NJ, 5 grandchildren; Nina Cutro-Kelly, Moriah Cutro-Kelly, Galen Cutro-Kelly, Pietro (Pete) Cutro and Steve Cutro, several nieces, nephews and loving friends and colleagues.Because of the pandemic, the family was unable to hold visitation hours or funeral services. He is buried with his wife, Angela, the love of his life, at Gerald B.H. Solomon Saratoga National Cemetery. Military honors will be rescheduled at a later time and will be announced to the public.

Spring means strawberries.
 I spent Mother’s Day with dinner at the Pearigens and enjoyed a lengthy phone visit with the Andersons.
 Tina and Paul planned a relaxed day and an afternoon ride in rural Oregon. Wendy, Robert and the kids treated me to hamburgers with all the trimmings. Cheese, lettuce, chilies, pickles, onions, tomatoes and the secret sauce. Dinner included green salad and gourmet broccoli mac-and-cheese. Delicious.
 So good in fact there was no room for dessert and that’s where strawberries come in. We all passed on dessert, exclaiming “too full.”
 That brings me to this week’s recipe. Can you guess? Shortcake, of course, my grandmother’s traditional, old-fashioned take on this family favorite.
 First off, we never use store-bought, spongy disks, which are basically unadorned Twinkies. I’ve known people who will decry the Twinkie and swear by their counterparts for dessert.

 The overall goal, as Hancock sees it, is to breathe new life into the complex, making it a “global destination for agricultural heritage and innovation.”
 In the coming months, he said, the city will be exploring other opportunities for revenues to support the project, including tapping into potential federal infrastructure funds.
 “We look forward to pursuing completion of the campus under more favorable economic conditions,” he wrote, “as well as making adjustments to ensure equitable participation in our community engagement process in light of COVID-19.”
