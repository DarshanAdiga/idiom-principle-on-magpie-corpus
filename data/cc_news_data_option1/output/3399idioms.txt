Any pandemic, in any historical period, would benefit from a Bill & Tedmovie. “Bill & Ted Face the Music” makes that clear enough. It opens in theaters and online this weekend. While it’s adequate at best in its screen comedy technique, its heart is supremely generous. And its unfashionably persistent belief in the value of “being excellent to each other” goes down especially well in 2020, when so many have forgotten that one.
 First things first: Keanu Reeves. He and his less-starry costar Alex Winter, as the San Dimas, Calif. friends for life, are now in their mid-50s. Now married (to their medieval princesses) with young adult daughters seriously into music, the duo isn’t a middle-aged extension of the duo introduced in “Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure” (1989) and “Bill & Ted’s Bogus Journey” (1991). They’re pretty much _exactly_ the same guys, although Reeves — with jet-black hair, chalky-white features and an air of karaoke reluctance — seems to have re-learned the character from a Kabuki theater master.
