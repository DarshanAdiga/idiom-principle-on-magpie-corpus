SIOUX CITY, Iowa (AP) — Hundreds of ducks and other migratory waterfowl have been hit and killed by cars in northwestern Iowa after they mistook wet pavement for wetlands, wildlife officials said.
 State conservation officer Steve Griebel, with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, said he began receiving phone calls and texts about ducks on roads and parking lots in Woodbury County starting around 9:30 p.m. Monday and into early Tuesday. He went to investigate after sunrise, taking Highway 20 east of Sioux City.
 “I counted over 200 dead ducks on the highway, and can only imagine how many dead ones were out of sight in the ditch,” Griebel said in a news release. “It was all different species — mostly bluebills, but there were mallards, buffleheads, teal. It must have been an epic migration.”
 The waterfowl were migrating south from colder climes in the Dakotas and Canada, according to the department.
 Migratory waterfowl tend to migrate at night, state waterfowl biologist Orrin Jones said. The birds likely left when the weather was clear before they met a strong weather front and freezing rain that forced them to set down in Woodbury County, he said.

Elmarzouky said her father started by printing and distributing invitations. Anyone wanting or needing a meal was welcome to present an invitation for the festive ham and turkey dinner at the restaurant on Lancaster Avenue, no questions asked.
 Last year, about 1,600 were guests of the Elmarzouky family and their restaurant.
 "People First is one of the most wonderful events in Berks County," said Jay Worrall, president of Helping Harvest.
 Before joining the staff of the food bank last year, Worrall helped coordinate volunteers for the event.
 Wanting to increase Helping Harvest’s role in the dinner giveaway, Worrall met with Sabrina Elmarzouky and others. The team agreed to continued the tradition this year, but with some changes due to the coronavirus crisis.

“We may well be facing a hospital surge that’s starting now that could continue for weeks or months,” Spitters said. “I think we really have to accept that we could be in for a very long and difficult winter.”
 In a statewide news conference Tuesday afternoon, health officials pleaded with Washingtonians to take action against the spread of the virus.
 "We think the most serious consequences are yet to come," Secretary of Health John Wiesman said. "If we don't act swiftly the repercussions could be severe."
 The accelerated growth in the past two weeks — which is at record-high levels throughout the state — is the most concerning, State Health Officer Dr. Kathy Lofy said.
 “Immediate action is needed from all of us to avoid new restrictions and prevent our hospitals from becoming overwhelmed,” Lofy said. “This situation is extraordinarily urgent, and we’re running out of time to change direction. We need everyone in Washington state to take action now to stop the spread of COVID-19.”
 Spitters echoed those sentiments.
 “It’s time to commit to protecting our hospitals, shrinking down our social circles, hunkering down at home for the winter and signing up for delayed gratification to enjoy holidays with loved ones next winter,” he said. “Meanwhile, our hospitals, schools and businesses are counting on all of us to help them stay open and serve the people they’re there to serve. Think of others, and choose and act responsibly.”
 Currently, COVID-19 hospitalization rates in Snohomish County remain below the state’s goal of less than 10% but are climbing, according to state Department of Health data.
 “The hospital surge has arrived,” Spitters said. “It’s not been as high as it was before. Hopefully we can bend this curve and get things back down before it does exceed capacity.”
 Capacity isn’t the sole worry at area hospitals. Staffing is a major problem, Spitters said.
 “There’s a nursing shortage,” he said. “So sometimes even though hospitals have beds, they don’t have the people to put next to the bed to take care of the patient.”
 In the past two weeks, there have been 1,821 new confirmed cases in Snohomish County, including 74 in Stanwood, according to Snohomish Health District data updated Nov. 9.
 In the past two weeks, Island County has recorded 64 new cases, including 25 on Camano, according to the Island County Public Health data as of Nov. 6.
 Josephine Caring Community in Stanwood — which had been COVID-free since an outbreak in the spring that reached 33 people — recently had nine new cases between staff and residents in the skilled nursing part of the facility.
 The facility increased restrictions, including ceasing communal activities, non-essential visitation and new admissions, according to a statement on the organization’s website.
 “We recognize these restrictions are difficult for residents, staff and their families. It is our hope that cases can be contained and do not spread,” the statement read. “As a collective group, it is important that we have 14 consecutive days without any active cases at which point we will go back to less-restrictive operating procedures.”
 To combat the increasing cases regionwide, Spitters and other health officials continue to urge people to wear face coverings, stay home whenever possible and avoid even small gatherings.
 “Holding gatherings is a threat to all,” Spitters warned. “We should stop it for the time being. Plain and simple, just stop the gatherings. Reduce your social activity and other non-essential travel and activity.
 “If it’s not for work, school or medical purposes, I think the safest bet for us all is to just skip it,” he continued. “Don’t attend gatherings. Avoid businesses and people who don’t follow the guidance.”

Under the supply agreement with HB, Lucara's +10.8 carat production is being sold at prices based on the estimated polished outcome of each diamond, determined through state of the art scanning and planning technology, with a true up amount payable to Lucara on actual achieved polished sales in excess of the initial estimated polished price, less a fee and the cost of manufacturing. The +10.8ct diamonds of poorer quality (clivage low, rejection goods) are sold as rough parcels and do not enter the polishing pipeline at HB This unique pricing mechanism is expected to deliver regular cash flow at superior prices for this important segment of our production profile. The decision to enter into the supply agreement with HB for the remainder of 2020 followed a trial period during Q2 2020 where approximately 3,100 carats of +10.8 carat rough diamonds were placed into manufacturing ("Shipment 1"). Lucara will receive payment for the polished diamonds from Shipment 1 once those diamonds are sold by HB to an end customer, less a fee and the cost of manufacturing.

 “It is a big relief for all of us as our cinemas remained locked for over seven months,” said M. Rathnakumar of Virudhunagar, secretary of Theatre Owners’ Association.
 However, the lower turnout is said to be due lack of publicity and absence of new releases. “Besides, Tuesday has always been a day with the lowest patronage,” Mr. Rathnakumar said.
 In Madurai, two theatres screened movies on Tuesday.
 Kallanai theatre in Vandiyur here was one of them. “As a matter of sentiment, we released MGR-starrer ‘Ninaithathai Mudippavan’ just to reflect our thoughts to win over the present crisis,” said its owner M. Balaji Kannan (39).
 Though there were only two persons for the first show at 12 noon, the show went on as scheduled. In the other two shows, only a handful of fans had turned up.
 President of Theatre Owners’ Association R. Kannan of Madurai said the new releases would attract more fans. He said theatre owners would meet on Wednesday to discuss the opening of all theatres.
 However, Mr. Rathnakumar hoped that all theatres in the State would open with new movies are promised to be released on Deepavali day. But, he was quick to add saying that only films of big stars will help the cinema halls to break even.
 “No other platform will be able to give the feel and joy of movie watching like that of a theatre. It’s not only because of the big screens and better audio system, but also due to the sheer presence of huge number of fans,” he added.

TOPEKA—District Judge Robert Bednar of the 1st Judicial District will retire January 11 after 22 years of service.
 Bednar became a judge in 1998. He served in Leavenworth County until moving to Atchison County District Court in 2008. The 1st Judicial District is composed of those two counties.
 Bednar has overseen juvenile, civil, and criminal dockets.
 He said he found overseeing juvenile court both satisfying and discouraging.
 "It's sad and heartbreaking seeing the circumstances of some of our youth—the lack of family, parenting, and education. They have a huge mountain to climb," he said. "As a juvenile judge you always have to bear in mind the long-term effects of your decisions. I remember those who succeed with great fondness, but unfortunately there are far too few of them."
 He had been in private practice for 25 years when he sought appointment as a judge.
 "I wanted the opportunity to continue in the law but from a different vantage point," he explained. "As a lawyer you represent the interests of your client, but as a judge you need to see the entire picture so you can decide a case on its merits in a fair and impartial manner.
 "I think every judge hopes that when the parties leave the courtroom, whether they agree with your decision or not, they believe they have received fair shake," he added.
 His advice to a lawyer wanting to become a judge is to be well-rounded.
 "They should get as much experience in as many areas as they can. It never ceases to amaze me the broad spectrum of cases I hear and for which I must render a decision," he said.Bednar graduated from Washburn University in 1967 and Washburn University School of Law in 1973.
 Bednar and his wife, Susan, have been married 53 years. They have three children, Matthew, Jennifer and Erin, and nine grandchildren.
 "I would never have been able to succeed without the support of my wife, who has always been there for me," he said.
 District judges in the 1st Judicial District are appointed following a merit selection process. State statute requires a nominating commission to accept nominations, interview nominees, and forward the names of finalists to the governor, who appoints a replacement. After serving one year in office, the new judge must stand for a retention vote in the next general election to remain in the position. If retained, the incumbent will serve a four-year term.

THE FACTS: When Michigan’s Antrim County initially reported a landslide win for Joe Biden in the U.S. presidential election, social media users grew suspicious about the Dominion election management system used to tabulate the data.
 As it turned out, Dominion was not to blame, according to the Michigan Department of State. "There was no malice, no fraud here, just human error,” County Clerk Sheryl Guy told the AP.
 The issue was quickly corrected, and President Donald Trump won a majority of votes in that county. However, in the days since Biden won Michigan and the presidential election, Trump supporters have continually tried to undermine trust in Dominion, which is used in at least 30 states, including key battlegrounds like Georgia.
 Several widely shared social media posts this week exaggerated a one-time connection six years ago between Dominion and the Clinton Foundation in order to claim the election software should not be trusted.
 “Is it a coincidence that Dominion Voting is in bed with you guessed it… The Clinton Foundation?” read one tweet shared more than 7,000 times.
 Some posts shared a screenshot from the Clinton Foundation’s website. It shows that in 2014, at a meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative, Dominion made a philanthropic commitment to donate its election technology to emerging democracies outside the United States as part of a three-year project.

While I wasn’t around for the early days of Avalara, our CEO Scott McFarlane regularly evangelizes the mission our founders set out on more than 15 years ago. We all know that taxes have been around since the dawn of humanity and that the United States was founded on the basis of a tax dispute. Nearly every person and business in the world is impacted by indirect taxes and is burdened with managing their obligations. For as long as we can tell people have been managing tax manually using spreadsheets and personnel to stay compliant. Our founders knew that there was a better way to manage compliance through the use of technology. They also knew that they couldn’t accomplish their mission alone and that they would need partners to bring our products to customers. As a result, Avalara has worked to create the industry’s leading partner ecosystem of more than 700 invoicing, billing, and technology partners that enables Avalara to automate tax compliance virtually anywhere an invoice is created.

Both of these former world champions have seen better days but they put on an entertaining and competitive eight round fight. Ruenroeng boxed on the back foot raking the oncoming Pungluang with counters and then standing and exchange with both fighters landing heavy shots. This was no exhibition match and both fighters showed flashes of temper with the referee asking them to clean things up. Ruenroeng did all of the good work for the early rounds and then when he tired over the last three rounds tied Pungluang up inside and did enough to hold on to his lead. Scores 77-75 twice and 78-74 for Ruenroeng. He is a former IBF flyweight champion who learned to box whilst in jail and was released so he could follow a professional career. At 40 he is unlikely to fight for a title again but in August he gave Srisaket a hard time in losing a ten rounder. Pungluang, 31, a former WBNO bantamweight champion, is on the down slope and with this loss his recent record is 2-6.

To be honest I don’t know, I think I have to always be optimistic that things will improve but we also have a very long way to go. Sometimes the baby steps we take are hard to appreciate because we are fighting for so much and receive so little in return. I’m optimistic because previously I thought the Washington football team would never change their name for example, we’ve seen mass displays of acknowledgment that Black Lives Do Matter, and some police and criminal justice reform. However, what about the educational system, what about the low number of people of color who sit in positions of authority, can we talk about unequal hiring practices? How long before we have another Black President? Will we ever have a Latinx female President? Or Native American on the Supreme Court? When you start to see how far we have to go to promote inclusivity and equal representation it’s hard not to feel doubtful. Especially when you know everyone is not in agreement with you on making a change. Those getting to a place of equality means right now we need to focus on people of color and underrepresented groups that have been marginalized and oppressed. However, we have to keep fighting, I remember something my grandfather told me when I complained about racism when I was in undergrad-he responded with “oh you wanna tell me about racism and what’s difficult” and I realize that I stand on the shoulders of people that came before me and my job is not only to keep pushing forward but to bring others with me. That was my father told me and many others have told their children that you are going to work twice as hard and receive half as much but you have to keep pushing forward and working to make this world a better place and I’m hopeful that at least we will leave the country in a better place than the generation before.

She believes it’s possible to carve out at least a few minutes every day to move your body in a mindful way without interrupting other areas of your life. She suggests intensive exercises like jumping jacks, going on a walk for a change in environmental scenery, or a muscle relaxation practice like tensing up all of your muscles and then releasing them on an exhale.

The results of the 2020 election are not in doubt. Republicans made gains in the House, control of the Senate will come down to two runoff elections in Georgia, and Joe Biden won the presidency. It wasn't close. He is on track, at the moment, to win 306 Electoral Votes, the same number Donald Trump won in 2016. His leads across the key states that made the difference are likely to be larger--often much larger--than those that got Trump across the line last time. Oh, and Biden got millions and millions more citizens' votes, not that it matters, strictly speaking, in our boneheaded system.
 Yet the president and his allies refuse to accept the very clear outcome. His campaign is firing off spurious lawsuits left and right, screaming about fraud. (Trump telegraphed this play ahead of the election--it has no relationship to what actually happened. He was always going to do it.) His Senate apparatchiks are suggesting the results are in doubt, and the two Georgia senators up in that state's upcoming runoffs have been enlisted to attack Georgia's Republican secretary of state. More than all that, the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, could be found "joking" Tuesday that "there will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration." As we know now, people in this movement are _joking_ until they're not, and they're not really laughing when they are. They are leering as they do it, injecting something into the body politic with a wink and a nod to see if it might take root there. Oh, and his pet attorney general is busy adding a patina of legal clout to the whole scam.
 But all that may pale in comparison to the president's move to purge the Department of Defense this week--again, while simultaneously rejecting the results of the democratic election he lost. He fired the Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper, and passed over many candidates in the line of succession to haul Christopher Miller, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, into the big time. One wonders why he might have been chosen. So, too, with the new Pentagon chief of staff, Kash Patel, "a former Devin Nunes staffer who worked to discredit the Russia investigation," according to Jennifer Griffin of Fox News. Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Joseph Kernan is also reportedly out. Meanwhile, there's talk he'll get new people in at the CIA and the FBI.

Reilingen.Jetzt feiern die Laubbäume ihr farbenprächtiges Abschiedsfest. Sie beginnen mit dem Abbau von Chlorophyll und die Blätter färben sich gelb, orange und rot. Oft wird das herbstliche Spektakel auch als „Indian Summer“ bezeichnet. Ursprünglich meint dieser Begriff eine ungewöhnlich trockene, warme Wetterphase im Spätherbst in Nordamerika, die dort für eine besonders intensive Färbung der Laub- und Mischwälder sorgt. Doch auch in unseren Breitengraden „entflammen“ viele Gehölze im Herbst. In besonders schönen Blattfarben leuchten unsere Ahornbäume und die gerne mit ihnen verwechselten Amberbäume.

“The practical consequence of Trump’s call to vigilance to prevent fraud was increased scrutiny from both sides, and this increased scrutiny seems to have worked,” Jones said. “Election officials have been more careful, and election procedures have been followed more scrupulously than usual.”
 The federal agency charged with leading efforts to secure U.S. elections has said there were no significant problems aside from small, ordinary glitches.
 This year’s presidential election marked a significant step in the use of paper voting records, with more ballots being cast either on paper or with an electronic voting machine that generates a paper backup than in any previous election. The election was also the most transparent. Several election offices offered live webcams to show the ballot-review process and added the ability for voters to track their ballots through the process.
 “The system held up given the extraordinary circumstances that election officials faced,” said Amber McReynolds, who leads the National Vote at Home Institute. “Election officials managed to do their jobs even though, in most cases, they had one hand tied behind their back.”

FROSTBURG — This year marks the 13th season that the Frostburg Holiday Lamppost Committee will decorate the Mountain City for the holiday season.
 In 1996, the club purchased 16 metal hayrack baskets from a company in England to brighten up Main Street lampposts. Members, merchants and other volunteers plant and maintain what now totals 58 lamppost baskets on Main, Center and Broadway plus six baskets at The Depot.
 The baskets are rarely empty. Work sessions for the holiday decorat begin in September and by the weekend before Thanksgiving volunteers will fill the baskets with pine and lights. Team leaders add bows when the baskets are completed. The process of adding the wreaths to the top of the lampposts is accomplished through the support of city workers.
 Because there is a lot of work associated with the project, the committee is always looking for volunteers. The group works on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7 to 9 p.m. Contact Peggy Kealy at 301-689-3376 or Margie Nelson at 3901-697-0541 to lend a hand.

Developing mindfulness is like going to the gym. Realistically going to the gym and working out only once is not going to produce a dramatic physical change. Like ‘Arm Day,’ there are many types of mindfulness muscles that need time and effort to perfect, much like your dream body. It requires consistent ‘trips to the gym’ and practice. It is important not to be discouraged when one workout does not go as well, or you miss it; it happens, life happens, but just like a consistent exercise routine, the next day is a new day to get back on track. Whether it is sitting on the family room floor for five minutes before the kids come home from school, or spending an hour in a dedicated meditation room, closing your eyes and taking a few deep breaths could work wonders to reset and revamp your brain for the rest of your day.

I kept my word when I made “Seeking Valentina” and “The Carting Call.” Both short films have received nominations and awards. The success looks great on paper, but it wasn’t necessarily easy communicating with some of my cast and crew members about the clear vision I had for Seeking Valentina, which was portraying Iranian-Americans as everyday people. No matter how many visual references I was making to Alfred Hitchcock, Ingmar Bergman or Stephen King; there were no major movies out there that people can grasp on about the point of view of Iranian-immigrants and their American-born children living in America. Most of the major American movies that featured Iranian people, would always be linked to politics, or their ethnicity was the character, instead of having a character arc.

“He's ready for it. I don't think he's feeling any pressure," Turgeon said of Wiggins. “There will many nights when he's our leading scorer, and there will be nights when he's not our leading scorer and we'll still win."
 Last season, it was easy to identify the team's studs. Now, even after watching the team practice for months, Turgeon isn't sure.
 “I don't know who our best players are and all that stuff," he said. “The great thing for me as a coach is I can go in a lot of different directions. That's what I'm most excited about."
 EXPERIENCE COUNTS
 Wiggins, a 6-foot-6 junior, averaged 10.4 points last season, the only player besides Cowan and Smith to reach double figures.
 He will be joined by senior Darryl Morsell and junior Eric Ayala in a three- man backcourt. With Cowan no longer in the mix, Morsell has stepped up to become the voice of experience on and off the court.
 “Darryl Morsell has probably grown into a leader more than any player I've ever had," Turgeon said. “It's a natural thing for him. He's real good at making practice competitive and kind of being a real jerk about it, but everybody respects the way he goes about it. All the players know he really cares about them."

From an evolutionary and biopsychosocial standpoint, it’s no wonder why hospital administrators are so stressed – psychologically, it makes perfect sense. We shoulder great responsibility and with that we endure perpetual, longitudinal chronic stress, leading to stress reactive responses and the associated ill effects that stress causes. Many of the stressors we face are frankly out of our control. So, the key for administrators is to learn to focus on what is within our personal ability to control. This is often easier said than done. I remember when I was going through a particularly difficult time in my life, I went to a therapist to seek assistance. After explaining my situation over several sessions and looking forward to meaningful guidance, the well-meaning therapist told me that I have control over my schedule and can simply structure my calendar to work from 9 to 5, enabling me to balance my life better. She said the hours I kept were my choice. Really? Can any of you limit your schedule to 9 to 5 every day? I could not get the therapist to understand that I have a busy medical staff than can only meet with me at 7 am and then I have board meetings, medical executive committees, community meetings, individual physician meetings, chamber of commerce meetings, political meetings, and many others that can only take place in evenings. So much for having significant control over the schedule.

 # Bill Belichick: Resigning from New York Jets was 'one of the great moments of my career'
 Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz
 USA TODAY
 More than 20 years later, Bill Belichick still looks back fondly at the move that shaped his career.
 After his New England Patriots beat the New York Jets on Monday in a last- minute 30-27 comeback victory, Belichick was asked on WEEI on Tuesday about his decision in 2000 to step down from the Jets after just one day as the team's head coach. He famously broke the news by writing "I resign as HC of the NYJ" on a loose piece of paper.
 “One of the not only most defining, but one of the great moments of my career," Belichick said of his resignation. "That combined with Robert (Kraft) giving me the opportunity to come here, I couldn’t have asked for anything more. That wasn’t a good situation for me, and I didn’t want to be part of it, so I wasn’t."
 Belichick served as the Patriots' assistant head coach in 1996 for the team's Super Bowl run under longtime coaching mentor Bill Parcells, who brought him over to the Jets after the head coach was traded to New York following that season.
 In his press conference following his January 2000 resignation, Belichick cited "various uncertainties" related to the Jets' new ownership as the cause for his decision to step down. Looking back, Belichick on Tuesday again stressed how much he valued buy-in from the highest level of a franchise and pointed to his relationship with Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who gave up a first-round pick in a package to the Jets to secure the coach.
 "The other half of that was Robert giving me the opportunity to come here and trading — I mean, he gave up quite a bit to get me to come here. That was a big trade. So I’m very thankful that it worked out. I appreciate all the support from Robert, the Kraft family, the Patriots organization and all the New England fans. I’ll keep trying to do my best for this team and this organization, give them the very best that I can. But I’m very thankful for the opportunity to come here, and I just wasn’t going to stay there in that situation. So it worked out.”
 Since the move, the Patriots have endured just one losing season — in 2000, Belichick's first year — and have won six Super Bowl titles, along with a record 11 consecutive AFC East crowns.
 The Jets, meanwhile, have cycled through six head coaches since 2000. The team's nine-year playoff drought is the third-longest active streak in the NFL.

Notably missing from the clip was PC's usual counterpart: Mac, played by actor Justin Long.
 In the original commercials, Long played the young, hip "Mac," a representation of the Apple Macintosh, while Hodgman plays a fuddy-duddy "PC," a representation of the Microsoft personal computer. The ads helped Apple project a reputation for being cool and easy to use, with an emphasis on Mac's capabilities like creating home movies and working straight out of the box. Meanwhile, the commercials took swipes at other personal computers, claiming that they were glitchy and virus-prone.
 The commercials even inspired a response from Microsoft, which ran an "I'm a PC" campaign in 2008 to refute Apple's negative marketing.
 On Tuesday, Apple also said that the MacBook Pro would have quieter "active cooling systems," rather than fans, and that the Mac Mini has an "advance thermal design" to keep it "cool and quiet."

Having a set schedule and routine in the morning can set the tone for the rest of the day. Right now there are so many websites that state the exact number of things you should do every single morning without fail for success. I, however, do not subscribe to that philosophy. I think a morning routine should be what works for the person. Studies support certain techniques and practices that can help improve the trajectory of your day; these include but are not limited to daily affirmations, goal-setting, mindfulness, stretching, journaling, physical activity, fresh air and hydrotherapy. Apart from the inclusion of mindfulness, I think the rest of your routine comes down to personal preference. Some people have morning routines that are two minutes long and that is all they need, whereas there are others who prefer two hours or more.

This year’s Veterans Day observance in Windber will be a little different because of the COVID-19 virus. According to Bob Portante, a member of Windber’s VFW, the event will start at 11 a.m. Wednesday, rain or shine at Veterans Park.
 Only the veterans of the Windber VFW Post 4795 and Windber American Legion Post 137 will participate in this celebration.
 The master of ceremonies will be the Rev. George Gulash, who will also give the invocation and benediction. Portante said the observance will be a “modified, private version of our normal and public Veterans Day celebration. We will have an invocation, the presentation of our Veterans Wreath, the raising of the flag of the United States of America. The MC will then recognize the past veterans who are represented by the empty chairs of each American generation in the last 100 years.

 Veterans Day, once known as Armistice Day, is a federal holiday in the United States noted to honor military veterans, persons who served in the United States Armed Forces and were discharged under conditions other than dishonorable. Major hostilities of World War I were formally ended at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918, when the Armistice with Germany went into effect”, said Portante. “At the urging of the major U.S. veteran organizations, Armistice Day was renamed Veterans Day in 1954.”

LET the public flogging begin. Set up the stocks outside Leinster House. Bring the tomatoes to throw at Séamus Woulfe. The main opposition party has already decided where it stands.Sinn Féin wants him gone.The party&rsquo;s justice spokesperson Martin Kenny says it is &quot;not a desirable, or frankly tenable, situation for a Supreme Court judge to remain in office if he does not enjoy the confidence of the Chief Justice or his colleagues&quot;.Deputy Kenny has appointed himself as judge, jury and executioner.Except it&rsquo;s not that simple.Séamus Woulfe is a Supreme Court judge, yes. He is held to a higher level of standards, scrutiny and study, yes.He is also a citizen of this State and has the same rights as everyone else.In his case, as a judge in the highest court in the land, Justice Woulfe&rsquo;s position carries greater protections under the Constitution. Article 35.4 of Bunreacht na hÉireann is quite clear.&ldquo;A judge of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal, or the High Court shall not be removed from office except for stated misbehaviour or incapacity, and then only upon resolutions passed by Dáil Éireann and by Seanad Éireann calling for his removal.&rdquo;To be sacked from his job, the Oireachtas has to show he has misbehaved or is incapable of carrying out his role.His fellow judges have arbitrarily decided they cannot sit with him on the bench.Chief Justice Frank Clarke says it is his &ldquo;personal view&rdquo; the judge should go, given what he described as the &ldquo;irreparable damage&rdquo; caused by the controversy over Justice Woulfe&rsquo;s attendance at the infamous Oireachtas Golf Society dinner.Justice Clarke has given his verdict but he doesn&rsquo;t have the authority to adjudicate on the matter.Justice Woulfe not only has the Constitutional protection but also has the conclusion of a report by former chief justice Susan Denham, who was commissioned by her successor Justice Clarke to review the matter.&quot;In the reviewer's opinion, based on the evidence and submissions she has received, she is of the view that Mr Justice Woulfe did nothing involving impropriety such as would justify calls for his resignation from office. Such a step would be unjust and disproportionate,&quot; she concluded.Justice Woulfe claims he was exonerated by this report, which did not call for his resignation. However, the publication of the transcript of his interview with Ms Denham caused consternation as he criticised the Government and the media over the handling of the &lsquo;Golfgate&rsquo; affair.Within political and legal circles there is a view the opinions he expressed have tipped his case over the line for Justice Clarke.Ms Denham recommended the Chief Justice resolve the matter &quot;by way of informal resolution&quot;.The informal resolution has now become extremely formal and has now been passed over to the Government in the form of a constitutional crisis, conundrum and calamity.Attorney General Paul Gallagher advised the Cabinet of the &ldquo;serious constitutional issues that now arise&rdquo; and the Government agreed it will &ldquo;continue to reflect on these issues&rdquo;. In other words, they&rsquo;ll now try to find a way out.The Coalition is in an invidious position. The new Government appointed Justice Woulfe, the outgoing attorney general, to the Supreme Court in July, so the Cabinet was satisfied of his character, judgment and expertise at that point.The separation of powers and the sanctity of the independence of the judiciary must also be upheld. The Government cannot afford to create a precedent here of a judge being removed due to public outrage. That&rsquo;s a slippery slope and a factor Justice Woulfe has identified himself.Balancing the potential for damage to the judiciary with the implications for the independence of individual judges due to pressure from fellow judges, Justice Woulfe said he had thought very deeply and taken extensive advice from a number of people.&ldquo;I have come to the conclusion that I should not resign,&rdquo; he said.Justice Woulfe is digging in and has no place to go other than continuing with that strategy. He has little choice as the 58-year- old is being asked to give up a lucrative livelihood and pension for no other form of income. However, sources within the Coalition say they can&rsquo;t do nothing.&quot;It&rsquo;s truly unprecedented and if he does not resign there will be a resolution put down on impeachment. The Government can&rsquo;t go against the Chief Justice who has kicked this back into the political arena,&rdquo; a source said.Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Feargháil reminded TDs of their constitutional function, if the matter ends up in impeachment proceedings before the Dáil and Seanad. The Ceann Comhairle warned TDs about any comments that &ldquo;could give rise to a perception of bias&rdquo;.Sinn Féin TDs, in particular, should take note as Martin Kenny&rsquo;s utterances certainly indicate he does not come with an open mind.Going down the impeachment route will not be relished within Leinster House.&ldquo;The politicians don&rsquo;t want anything to do with this anyway,&rdquo; a veteran Fine Gael figure noted.What exactly Justice Woulfe&rsquo;s offence is here is quite the question. No law was broken. The evidence against him is flimsy to say the least.An impeachment would be quite a long drawn-out affair and would have to be handled extremely carefully by the Houses of the Oireachtas.When sound-biting politicians are involved, that&rsquo;s not so easy.Even if it reaches a vote in the Dáil and Seanad, a number of TDs and senators would likely have to recuse themselves from the vote, either due to a conflict of interest or perception of bias.Justice Woulfe is being asked to pay a far higher price for his attendance at the infamous golf dinner than those in the political space.Dara Calleary did resign as Agriculture Minister and six senators lost the whip in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, but none of them lost their jobs. Phil Hogan&rsquo;s resignation as European Commissioner followed controversy over his movements in the country.An apology is all that was offered by the captain of the Oireachtas Golf Society in whose constituency the event took place. Independent TD Noel Grealish, one of the chief organisers, says he realised his error of judgment and he sincerely apologises.That&rsquo;s alright so. Carry on.The Galway West TD will continue to vote with the Government in the Dáil with no reprimand from the Coalition or Oireachtas.The hope now within Government is Justice Woulfe decides to stand aside.He has shown no appetite for compromise thus far. After fending off the professional pressure of his colleagues, it&rsquo;s unclear political pressure will make much of a difference.The judiciary have already made a meal out of this affair so the politicians want to avoid ending up turning it into a complete dog&rsquo;s dinner.

Romanov bullies and batters a shot Liakhovich inside two rounds. Liakhovich was trying to keep Romanov out with a weak jab in the first and Romanov was able to connect with rights over the top of Liakhovich’s jab. Just before the bell he pinned Liakhovich to the ropes and blasted him to head and body. Romanov continued to put pressure on Liakhovich in the second sending him to the ropes and bombarding him with punches. Liakhovich fought his way off the ropes a couple of times but when he was forced back there again Romanov unloaded with some solid thumps and Liakhovich slumped to his knees and made no attempt to beat the count. Eleventh inside the distance win for the 35 year-old Romanov. He was a top line amateur and included a third round kayo of Deontay Wilder back in 2008 in his victories. He was European and World Junior champion and won the Russian title in 2009. He dropped boxing in 2010 and did not fight again until he turned pro in 2016.

Wamego had one of the most productive backfields in Class 3A last season with the trio of Isiah Childs, Taybor Vetter and Brad Sackrider racking up nearly 5,000 yards rushing along.
   
 With all three graduating, however, Wamego coach Weston Moody seemingly had some serious question marks as to where his Red Raider team would find its offense in 2020. But he also knew he had one pretty good answer, turning the team over to sophomore quarterback Hayden Oviatt.
   
 Never mind that Oviatt had never taken a single snap at the position. Not at the high school level. Not at the middle school or youth levels, either.
   
 "He was always a running back, but I didn't have any hesitation," Moody said. "Last year, I saw him throw the ball a little bit and I was like, 'Man, if he wasn't a freshman right now I might put him at starting quarterback.' Brad was good there, but he was probably our best receiver. It was a crazy idea, especially with three seniors back there that went on to play college ball.
   
 "But he's just an athlete. A kid that's tough and hard-nosed. He wanted that spot. He's done what we wanted him to and what we thought he could do."
   
 Oviatt has been a presence for sure. After missing the season-opener due to quarantine, Oviatt has been one of the most productive players in 4A. He's run for 1,399 yards and 11 touchdowns and thrown for another 1,085 yards and nine scores.
   
 Oviatt's emergence has helped Wamego to one of the best seasons in program history. He ran for 211 yards and three touchdowns in last Friday's 21-18 Class 4A playoff road win over El Dorado, helping the Red Raiders (6-4) make the state quarterfinals for just the third time in the last 20 years.
   
 The last time Wamego reached the quarterfinals came in 2015 in the Class 4A Division II playoffs. The Red Raiders haven't reached a state semifinal since 1975.
   
 After enduring a three-game losing streak late in the season, Wamego may not have seemed like a likely candidate to reach the quarterfinals. But considering two of the losses came to teams who were undefeated at the time -- Paola and Fort Scott -- and the other was to six-time reigning Class 4A state champion Miege, Wamego was battle tested to say the least.
   
 Moody has no doubt that heightened competition -- Miege a late addition after COVID scratched two opponents from Wamego's original 2020 schedule -- has proved big in the postseason.
   
 "I wanted that game with Miege as soon as we saw KC schools were going to cancel," Moody said. "The kids wanted it, we wanted it as a coaching staff because we want to play the best competition we can. Midseason is the perfect time to see where you're at and with Miege and Paola perfectly in the middle, that gave an idea of what we needed to work on, how physical we need to be.
   
 "We had three games that we learned a lot about our team. We're not too worried about wins and losses in the regular season, we want to be battle- tested and that really helped us Friday night."
   
 Wamego got off to a somewhat slow start, falling down 6-0 after the first quarter. But Oviatt had TD runs for 89 and 1 yards in the second quarter to give the Red Raiders a 14-12 halftime lead.
   
 After El Dorado went back up 18-14 in the third, Oviatt responded with a 6-yard TD run that proved to be the game-winner.
   
 Wamego will now take on Arkansas City, which upset Andover Central 33-28 last Friday. The Bulldogs are just 4-6 on the season, but Moody is plenty wary of a team that has reached the state quarterfinals each of the last three seasons, all three times with losing records.
   
 "People have been saying, 'You guys should be able to win this one, they're only 4-6,' " Moody said. "But most people don't know the teams they're playing. They're playing Goddard, they're playing Maize and those tough teams in the AVCTL. This won't be an easy game at all. They've done a nice job the past couple years of making a run in the playoffs.
   
 "Ark City is going to be a quality team. ... We have our hands full, but I don't think it's something that's unattainable. We're just going to keep doing what we do and it's all about limiting mistakes and playing your best football."

The Royal Family doesn't exactly take a back seat over the 10 episodes, perhaps because Colman and the rest of the core cast remain fabulous, including an episode where an intruder improbably finds his way into the palace. In the "Oh, to be a fly on the wall" department, Morgan fills in the gaps.
 The Queen even finds herself second-guessing her parenting skills, given how the now-grown children have turned out, a subplot that takes on a slightly different meaning in light of questions surrounding Prince Andrew's relationship with accused sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein.
 The new season starts out a bit slowly, but the action quickly picks up. All told, the show remains an utterly enjoyable binge, even if the latest season doesn't quite measure up to the previous ones -- a byproduct of the years and conflicts encompassed.
 While this material encompasses what's perhaps the most media-friendly period in terms of subject matter, the emphasis on Diana and Charles can't help but feel more People magazine-ish, and thus less revelatory. (By contrast, the earlier struggles of Princess Margaret, played by Helena Bonham Carter last season, were a highlight, and her role is diminished.)
 That quibble doesn't significantly detract from the show's status as one of Netflix's -- and indeed TV's -- best. Like everything else associated with the much-examined lives of the Royals, chalk it up as another high-class problem.

In light of the growing threat of climate change, it can be easy to feel resigned and to give up on the possibility of seeing the changes necessary to reverse the damage done to the environment. Policy changes are typically slow, and that can be discouraging. Likewise, there’s only so much a single person can do to change things. However, there is a growing contingent of people who are taking action to improve the world in small ways, and those numbers add up. By making certain changes to your lifestyle, you can reduce your negative impact on the environment, and the world benefits tremendously when more people embrace these methods.

December 20, 1926 - November 6, 2020
 Jefferson, WI - Ruth (Luebs) Frohmader, born December 20, 1926, died November 6, 2020 at St. Camillus Life Plan Community, Wauwatosa, WI. Born in Milwaukee, WI, Ruth was the daughter of Henry and Hilda (Tamms) Luebs. Ruth could always hold her own with her twin brother, Ray and two older brothers, Harold and Art. She grew up in Milwaukee's Tippecanoe neighborhood and attended Bayview High School. She played cello in the high school orchestra - and often said wearing a formal gown for performances was the highlight of her musical career.
 While in college at UW-Whitewater, she met her future husband, Paul Frohmader, on a blind date arranged by her sorority sisters. She graduated with a teaching degree in business education. She and Paul married in 1950 and enjoyed 68 years together.
 Ruth embraced life in Jefferson and as a parishioner of St. John's Evangelical Lutheran Church, where she was a member of Ladies Aid and other church and school organizations. Ruth worked in the Jefferson Middle School office and also served as a substitute teacher for many years.
 Ruth's family was the center of her life. She is survived by three children: Sheri (Dave) Farabaugh, Barb (Pat) Donoghue, and Doug (Rosemary Raiche) Frohmader; four grandchildren Bridget (Jake) Nelson, Andrew Frohmader, Timothy Donoghue and Michael Frohmader; two great-grandchildren, Madison and Ryan Nelson. She is further survived by her sisters-in-law Jeanette Luebs and Beth Preuss - and many nieces and nephews.
 Throughout Ruth's life, summer meant long weekends with family and friends at Wind Lake. She especially enjoyed the annual "work week" with her siblings - where actually, very little work was completed. Instead, many tall tales were told and many lasting memories made. Ruth enjoyed long pontoon rides, nightly bonfires - and chasing unwelcome swans away with an oar.
 "Auntie Ruth" had a feisty, fun-loving personality that endeared her to many nieces and nephews. She is well remembered for bounteous tables of food and no shortage of dessert.
 An avid card player, Ruth made weekly bridge club a priority for decades. In retirement years, she enjoyed traveling the world, visiting family and friends, and building memories with Paul.
 Family will gather to celebrate Ruth's life on Friday, November 13 at St. John's Evangelical Lutheran Church, in Jefferson, WI. There will be no public visitation, due to COVID guidelines. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to St. John's Evangelical Lutheran Church or a charity of your choice.
 The family would like to thank the staff at St. Camillus for their care during this challenging time.
 The Olsen-Gibson Funeral Home is caring for the family. To place an online condolence, please visit

We all have blind spots, and if a company, organization, or university wants to be inclusive you need to look around the room and see who is giving input. Is the staff racially diverse? Are there women in positions of power and authority? Also, you can’t have a token Black person or a single person of color because they can’t catch every micro aggression, or make sure every ad is racially sensitive. That is an unrealistic expectation, and the employee may not even want that responsibility. Rather you need multiple individuals who are knowledgeable about cultural sensitivity. Also, you need each person to have the position for their voice to be heard, respected, and implemented. Far too often people of color’s opinions and ideas fall on deaf ears. So, it’s not just that they are in the room, but they also have to have the power to make decisions or changes. From this then you can start to approach decisions from multiple perspectives. The power of diversity is that you want different viewpoints, ideas, or suggestions rather than relying on the same historical way that obviously is not always working or leads to racially insensitive messaging or the absence of people of color.

RICHMOND, Va. (WDBJ) - The commonwealth has announced bolstered efforts towards expanding its public health COVID-19 testing capacity.The Virginia Department of Health and the Virginia Department of General Services Division of Consolidated Laboratory Services have established the OneLab Network to create a coordinated coronavirus lab testing system.As a part of this program, contracts were awarded to Virginia Tech, University of Virginia Medical Center in Charlottesville, and Sentara Healthcare in Norfolk in an effort to invest in the future response to pandemics and other public health threats by establishing a structure for collaboration.The state is currently utilizing private vendors to add help with laboratory capacity.“We have said all along that it will take everyone working together to control the spread of COVID-19, and the OneLab Network does that by bringing together Virginia’s strong public health system with our clinical hospital and university lab partners to provide priority testing across the commonwealth,” added Governor Ralph Northam. “We have come a long way in increasing our COVID-19 testing capabilities over the past several months, and the new OneLab Network will help ensure public health has continued access to high-quality testing and prompt results.”The network has a goal of being able to perform 7,000 tests per day by the end of the year.“The OneLab Network laboratories selected are positioned geographically within the state to provide rapid test results in their regions,” explains the Virginia Department of Health.&nbsp;"Timely data is critical for prompt public health control measures, especially in high-risk congregate settings and communities across Virginia.Copyright 2020 WDBJ.

Kurbanov dismisses Mikhaylenko inside two rounds. Kurbanov bossed the first round tracking Mikhaylenko around the ropes and scoring with jabs and some clubbing rights to the head. When Mikhaylenko did come forward Kurbanov just brushed aside his attacks. Mikhaylenko was trying to weave his way inside in the second when a body punch had him turning away from the action and walking to a corner. The referee indicated the fight should continue and Kurbanov bombarded Mikhaylenko until Mikhaylenko managed to get out of the corner. Kurbanov attacked again and a wicked left to the body again saw Mikhaylenko retreat into a corner and although he stayed on his feet he was bent double and not able to continue. The 25-year-old Kurbanov “The Black Lion” is rated WBA 4/WBO 7/WBC 12 and has 12 wins by KO/TKO. He is a former World Junior champion. Right now it seems that 2021 might be a bit early but I can see him fighting for a world title in 2022. After winning his first 21 fights it has been a slippery slope for Mikhaylenko and he will probably continue to slide.

A Greater Sudbury-area man died Monday when the motorcycle he was driving collided with an SUV driver north of Toronto.
 The Nottawasaga Detachment of the OPP said officers were called just before 11:30 a.m. to a motor vehicle collision on Tottenham Road at the 8th Line, New Tecumseth, just west of Newmarket and north of Toronto.
 "A Nissan Pathfinder, which was travelling southbound on Tottenham Road, and two motorcycles were involved in a collision within the intersection at the 8th Line," police said in a release.
 "A group of three motorcycles was travelling together northbound when two of them became involved in the collision with the Nissan."
 The driver of one motorcycle, Gaetan Guilmette, 69, was pronounced dead at the scene of the collision, police said. He was the lone occupant of the motorcycle.
 An Ornge helicopter crew took the driver of the second motorcycle, a 53-year- old woman also from the Greater Sudbury area, to a Toronto-area hospital with serious injuries.
 She is still in hospital, police said.
 The driver of the third motorcycle was not involved in the collision.
 The driver of the Nissan, a 53 year-old woman, was transported to a local hospital with minor injuries.

I always say Obama is my favorite president, not because of any policy but because he won. His victory in 2008 showed anyone that was not a White man whether they were a woman or person of color that you can be the president. In addition, I would love to hear his thoughts, views, and some of his insight on creating social justice. In addition, I would love to meet Robert Townsend. Many of the stereotypical messages and the desire for African Americans to be viewed in non-minstrel roles, Robert Townsend addressed in his film. So, I would love to speak with him to hear about his inspiration and how also I could work on a research study that addresses some of these issues. Lastly, there are a few people in my profession I would love to meet such as Claude Steele, Nancy Boyd Frankiln, and Derald Wing Sue.

To this day, I still have that paper with me. It’s all crumbled now.

It was hard not having a support system and I felt alone at times. At the end of the day, I knew what I wanted to do with my life. If you have found your true calling in life, it doesn’t matter what people think. Even if it’s your childhood friends or members of your own family. They only know a part of you. The only person who knows the full you is yourself. Nothing in life is easy. Ignore the naysayers. They are afraid to fail and you should not be afraid because success comes from increasing your failure rate. Go for what you love and do it for yourself and yourself only.

Sanchez overpowers Howard with some impressive punching. Howard scored with a good right early in the first but Sanchez responded with a quick burst of punches and then kept Howard on the back foot with some strong jabs. Sanchez spun Howard around with two punches in the second. Howard connected with a an uppercut inside but Sanchez was finding the target with his jab and some body punches. In the third Sanchez had done most of the scoring before staggering Howard with a right hook inside. He landed two more punches as Howard stumbled back across the ring and down. He was up at four and the bell went after the eight count was completed. Sanchez sent Howard to the canvas with a left hook at the start of the fourth. Again Howard was up quickly but Sanchez leapt on him and put him down with two heavy head punches. Howard got up and took the fight to Sanchez but when he went down again from two rights the referee stopped the fight. The 28-year-old Cuban makes it twelve inside the distance wins. He is rated WBO 10/WBA 14 and has solid power and is rapidly becoming a factor in the heavyweight division. He is a former Cuban champion at 91kg. It is claimed he was 214-6 as an amateur despite having suffered at least eleven losses but he beat Erislandy Savon which not too many have and he is certainly a danger man. Howard, 40, got the high profile fight on the back of a 66 second blow out of Carlos Negron in August 2019 but he was not in the same class as Sanchez.

Pepper noticed some opportunities where DeChambeau's distance will serve him well. "I walked the golf course with Bryson in mind today. And I looked at different places somebody who could carry the ball that far would hit it and places that they would cut corners. There is a gap in 13 that he could take it up high and left and take it into an area that's beyond the trees and pushing the 14th fairway. It can be done. The same thing at eight. He's going to have to shoot that ball in there a little bit. And at five. If he misses left in the bunkers -- they're pretty much pitch-out bunkers. But if he can carry it up there, in these conditions, there are definitely advantages. We need to be reminded that it's still getting the ball in the hole. And while he did it at Winged Foot, I think this is a little bit different animal we're looking at here at Augusta National."

One might have to stretch their imagination pretty far to conjure up a scenario where South Carolina football coach Will Muschamp would need a player to take a bullet for him -- but should it ever arise, senior tight end Nick Muse is that devoted to his head coach.
 "Hopefully the chance never comes, but I would take a bullet for coach Muschamp," Muse told reporters Tuesday. "That's just how good of a person he is for me. That's how I see him, I see him as like a father figure. He's been nothing but respectful to me."
 Muse wasn't alone in his devotion to his coach. While the Gamecocks' head man has endured rampant speculation about his job security following one of the worst losses of his USC tenure, a 48-3 drubbing at home to Texas A&M, players expressed confidence in Muschamp.
 "We love Champ. He rides for us and we ride for him, and that's how it's always gonna be, as long as we're together," junior defensive lineman Kingsley Enegbare said.
 "There will always be outside noise. At the end of the day, that's my coach, I love him to death, and I'd do anything for him," redshirt sophomore running back Deshaun Fenwick added.

Though I am mindful we should be deliberate and specific in who is leading the charge. Furthermore, I state we have to be inclusive of everyone and meet them where they are at, part of what I am discussing is how we all hold biases and we all need to do social justice work not only for ourselves but also who do you fight for that does not look like you or identify the same as you? For example, let us talk about privilege. Topics such as privilege are met by White individuals with resistance or disbelief. Part of the reasoning behind this resistance is White fragility. In my opinion White fragility is a tiring and frustrating experience for people of color to discuss and help White individuals to work through because we are not afforded such privileges. Nonetheless, I must be mindful that I need White individuals who have power and privilege to help in this fight and speak to other White individuals about their privilege. Sometimes this requires more of me as a teacher than the person who has power. Sometimes, I have to be more caring, mindful, and patient with my White brothers and sisters than they ever were with me. The goal is not to promote cancelling culture per se as much as it is to hopefully bring these individuals along in the fight for social justice and hopefully have them understand how their past racist beliefs are incorrect and can be changed to create a more inclusive environment. The same is for people of color. Let me stop before I go any further and highlight what I am about to say is not reverse racism or people of color are just as racist as White individuals. With education about racism you will see that I am making a very different point. My point is that when we say Black Lives Matter, let’s make sure we are saying Black LGBTQ+ lives matter, Black Women’s lives matter. Those by promoting racial inclusivity for African Americans I also want to see progress for my Latinx brothers and sisters and other racial minority groups. I can be an ally for multiple cultural groups and understand that they are as well oppressed and sometimes even within their own cultural group in addition to the oppressive society. I talk about how this is part of the racist system where we fall into what is called the “Oppression Olympics” of who had it worse. The system unfortunately doesn’t allow for Black Lives Matter to also be a movement for other groups because unfortunately we are fighting for a tiny slice of the pie and the fear of losing our moment for another cause will cause division and not inclusivity. Also, we must be mindful that as people of color, we do not hold oppressive stereotypical views of other minorities that have been instilled upon us to maintain the status quo. For example, many people will believe that Jewish, Latinx, Asian Americans, sexual minorities, and others have not contributed to the advancement for African Americans and people of color through the civil rights and social justice movements. Whereas this could not be the furthest from the truth. The goal should be an inclusive and representative country and that requires not only for me to knowledgeable and proactive for the rights of people that are similar to me, but also just like for White individuals regarding race, as a Black Man I should be outraged and intentional about fighting anti-Semitism, for the rights of women, sexual minorities, undocumented immigrants, other racial minorities, and others.

Nearly 37,000 Bastrop County residents cast a ballot in the 2020 general election, marking a milestone for the county and shattering previous records for both voter participation and voter registration in an election.
   
 The elections office reported that 36,947 ballots were cast in Bastrop County for the general election, a 70.78% voter turnout from the 52,203 registered voters in the county.
   
 For comparison, in the 2016 presidential election 28,888 ballots were cast from 45,013 registered voters, marking a 64.18% turnout.
   
 This year's general election marked the first time in the county's history that more than 50,000 people were registered to vote in an election, as well as the first time more than 30,000 county residents voted in an election.
   
 Bastrop County's high voter turnout in the election can largely be attributed to early voting.
   
 Of the 36,947 ballots cast in Bastrop County, 31,378 came during early voting for the general election, a turnout of 60.1% out of all registered voters.
   
 This was the highest turnout percentage for early voting in a major Bastrop County election in recent history. In the 2004 presidential election, about 50% of all ballots were cast during early voting.
   
 This also set a new record for total votes cast during early voting, smashing the previous mark set during the 2016 presidential election by more than 10,000 votes.
   
 Bastrop County Elections Administrator Kristin Miles said compared to turnout during early voting, this year's Election Day voting turnout was slower.
   
 More than 20,000 voters could have cast a ballot on Election Day, but only about 5,500 did.
   
 She said that while the high turnout numbers didn't stay the course for Election Day, the overall turnout of 70.78% for the election was about 6% higher than recent presidential elections in the county.
   
 This voter turnout is the highest in Bastrop County since at least 1988, even besting the previous record set in the 1992 presidential election when 14,524 voters or 70.42% participated.
   
 "Early on, if we had maintained the same pace we had during early voting I would have projected a higher turnout," Miles said of the 2020 election.
   
 In October, Miles told the Advertiser that as part of early voting efforts, her office had mailed out over 5,000 ballots for the election.
   
 To help with this, Miles said the office had 14 people that worked on verifying signatures and preparing mail ballots for counting, an increase in manpower from past elections.
   
 "We did increase our ballot board size and the signature verification part of that," Miles said. "We also started early to allow additional time for those to be prepared for counting so that we could still release results shortly after the polls closed on Election Day. We had early voting results released at 7:30 p.m. on election night, so that wasn't significantly delayed even though we had a major increase in the number of people voting by mail."
   
 When those votes were tallied, it revealed a staunchly Republican bent from Bastrop County voters.
   
 In all contested federal and state races, the majority of Bastrop County voters selected Republican candidates, including incumbents Donald Trump and Mike Pence (55.81%) in the presidential race, John Cornyn (56.03%) in the U.S. Senate race, Michael McCaul in the U.S. House District 10 race, and John Cyrier (58.65%) in the race for Texas House District 17, which includes Bastrop County.
   
 Cornyn, McCaul and Cyrier won their reelection bids, while Trump is set for defeat after several days of uncertainty during which election officials sorted through and recorded mail-in votes in several battleground states across the country.
   
 When Bastrop County voters cast their ballots this year, they used either new electronic voting machines, which were used exclusively during the early voting period and also offered on Election Day, or a traditional paper ballot.
   
 Miles said her office received "quite a few compliments" from voters regarding the new electronic machines.
   
 "Many voters that were maybe originally hesitant about the new equipment actually really enjoyed voting on them," Miles said, adding that her office plans to continue to use the machines for early voting in future elections. "I think they were well received throughout the county."
   
 The Bastrop County Commissioners Court is expected to canvass the election results on Nov. 16, making them official.

Such a space, as it is envisioned by the committee, would include a theater space for plays, concerts and other types of performances, studio and rehearsal space for all types of art disciplines, a gallery for exhibits, and a gift shop. The concept is also to create what the committee describes as a “business incubator” to promote the arts and provide arts educational outreach to the community.
 Moreto has been involved in the arts for many years. She had a career in theater and television in New York where she said most of her work was “off- Broadway.” She was a member of the New York Ensemble Studio Theatre and the National Academy of Arts and Sciences. When her husband’s company downsized, and after “multiple snow storms” they decided to head south and have been in the Charleston area since 1994.
 She recently received the Town of Mount Pleasant’s Culture, Arts and Pride Commission’s 2020 National Arts and Humanities Award for her efforts to bring the arts to the area. The COVID-19 pandemic has unfortunately brought new challenges to her work.
 “We had planned to put on an opera for children during Piccolo (the Piccolo Spoleto Festival held each year in Charleston) last June,” she said. However, Piccolo was canceled due to the danger of the virus and the many plans the arts center committee had made also “were pushed on hold.”
 Moreto said they had planned to hold a fundraiser and were looking into starting a series of one-act plays. “What we are doing now is we formed a partnership with Charleston area performing artists and we do monthly networking sessions.” These sessions are held virtually. “We recently did one on the state of film in the area and last month was how to protect your online image.” November’s session will focus on marketing.
 Moreto emphasizes there is a large artistic community here that would provide culture and entertainment for the community and enhance the town’s livability. “There was the South Coast Symphony and the Town spoke to them about changing their name, so they did, and now they are the Mount Pleasant Symphony. They perform at Christ Church here in Mount Pleasant. But they have to go to The Citadel to rehearse. There is no place for them to rehearse here,” she said.
 “We don’t want this to just be a rental facility, we want to set up a resident acting company and then space can to rented out to other organizations who would like to use it,” Moreto stressed. “We’re not trying to be a performing arts center that brings big shows in from out-of-town. We want it to be for the community, to develop local theater for local talent.”
 The realities of the pandemic have forced a creative adjustment to how the arts, especially performance art, is managed. “Some groups are doing virtual performances,” Moreto said, emphasizing that artists will find a way to reach their audiences if they can. She said she hopes that people this year will consider supporting the local arts community when shopping for holiday gifts. ”Instead of doing your usual shopping,” she said, “go shop at art galleries, buy a piece of art, or a craft, shop at the museum shops. That helps to support the arts.”

back in Washington's backfield, but that hasn't stopped McKissic from getting his fair share of touches. Now with Kyle Allen out indefinitely and Alex Smith under center, McKissic could see his role grow even more. In the Week 9 loss to the Giants, McKissic was targeted a whopping 14 times, turning it into nine receptions for 65 yards. In the two games Smith has filled in for Allen, he has attempted 49 passes with 18 of them going in McKissic's direction. That is an incredible 36.7 percent target share. While that mark is likely not sustainable, Smith does have a history of targeting his running backs a lot. Allen could be the starting QB for the remainder of the season, which should bode well for McKissic's fantasy value moving forward. If he's still available on the wire, grab McKissic and don't think twice about it.

Another example is something I do with my clients. Create a customer retention strategy that moves new shoppers from say Amazon, over to their own website to capture their email and info creating a larger billable asset for the company. By example, implementing a support group for those who bought their product. It could be simply a how-to-use group, or a 21-day challenge group. Local businesses with already existing Facebook groups allowed their brick and mortar store owner members to offer a product, to help them gain sales when they had to be shut down. These “going the extra mile for their customer” actions created engagement like never before of loyal tribes over the last few months and the word of mouth advertising is going up drastically due to it.

Mannheim.Frank Bohmann (Bild) hält eine Neuansetzung von ausgefallenen Handball-Länderspielen in der EM-Qualifikation und von Europapokal-Partien in den Club-Wettbewerben in dieser Saison für nicht umsetzbar. „Die ausgefallenen Spiele in der EM-Qualifikation sind meiner Meinung nach nicht nachholbar“, sagte der Geschäftsführer der Handball-Bundesliga (HBL) dieser Redaktion: „Wenn wir uns den Rahmenterminplan bis zum Juni anschauen, gibt es keine freien Termine. Und mit Blick auf die ohnehin schon hohe Belastung kann man es den Spielern nicht zumuten, in einer Nationalmannschaftswoche plötzlich drei oder vier statt zwei Länderspiele zu bestreiten.“

It’s vital for brands to humanize themselves in order to build trust with current and potential customers. Humans want information from other humans. They want to see themselves in a product, whether that means adding a hand or pet model to product images or showing behind the scenes videos. Customers also love to see a brand’s founders and staff on its feed. While it may seem scary, it’s an impactful way to establish a human connection and grow brand loyalty.

The irony of the situation was that although I worked with domestic abuse offenders within my client group, teaching them about different types of abuse, and how victims were affected, I couldn’t actually see that I was in this type of relationship.

The Mike Bajakian Era got off to an explosive start in Week 1 against Maryland.
 The Wildcats’ offense put up 537 yards and 43 points in a stunning 40-point demolition of the Terrapins. With new offensive coordinator Bajakian calling plays and new grad transfer quarterback Peyton Ramsey at the controls, the Wildcats produced more points than they had scored in a Big Ten game since 2016.
 Since that sizzling start, however, Northwestern’s offense hasn’t generated nearly as much heat. They started with a bang but have been reduced to a whimper.
 Over the last two weeks the offense has averaged a pedestrian 295 yards and 21 points per game against Iowa and Nebraska. The Wildcats were outgained by their opponents in both contests and would rank dead-last in total offense in the conference based only on those two games.
 Of course, as head coach Pat Fitzgerald pointed out during Monday’s press conference, the newly minted, No. 23 Wildcats won both games, which is why they are sitting atop the Big Ten West this week at 3-0.
 “That’s all that matters,” he said.
 Fitzgerald went on to say that two things were responsible for the offense’s relative regression. First and foremost is the defenses they faced.
 “Nebraska and Iowa both are much improved defensively,” he said.
 Iowa has the No. 3 defense in the Big Ten and Nebraska is ranked eighth despite playing Ohio State in Week 1. Maryland is still ranked 12th, even though the Terrapins have posted consecutive wins after they were taken to the woodshed by Northwestern in the opener.
 The other thing is that the Wildcats are making mistakes, and plenty of them. Even in that impressive performance in the opener, Fitzgerald saw plenty of flaws.
 Fitzgerald rattled off a litany of improvements his offense has to make. Pad level on the offensive line. Sustaining blocks, particularly along the perimeter. What he called errors in “pitching and catching” – open throws that weren’t made, mistimed routes.
 He also cited penalties and turnovers. Northwestern was flagged an uncharacteristic eight times for 64 yards against the Huskers. And while the Wildcats’ defense has gotten a lot of attention for their takeaways this season – their eight interceptions lead the Big Ten – over the last two weeks, NU’s turnover margin is 0, as they have lost as many turnovers as they’ve gained (five).
 Ramsey, who went 23 of 30 (76.7%) for 212 yards and one touchdown passing against Maryland, has seen his numbers fall across the board, going a combined 27 of 45 (60%) for an average of 150 yards per game, with a total of two TDs and three interceptions. Likewise, the running game that ripped off 325 yards against the Terps has averaged 179.5 yards per game against Iowa and Nebraska.
 The offense’s saving grace has been its performance on third- and fourth-down. The Wildcats have converted 25 of 51 third downs, an average of 49.0% that ranks fourth in the Big Ten. They are also a perfect 6-for-6 on fourth downs, the most conversions in the conference.
 Fitzgerald summed it up by saying, “We’ve got to get a lot better. Even in the opener – maybe we had a lot of yards and we had a lot of points – but I still don’t feel like we’ve played cleanly.”
 They’ll get an opportunity to do that at 2-0 Purdue on Saturday night in a game that could put the winner in the early driver’s seat in the Big Ten West – though the specter of idle Wisconsin, which has played just one game due to a COVID-19 outbreak, still looms over the division.
 The Boilers boast the No. 1 passer (Aidan O’Connell), No. 1 receiver (David Bell) and No. 2 rusher (Zander Horvath) in the Big Ten, so they could score some points against the stingy Wildcat defense that is allowing just 12.0 points per game and has carried the team through the first three weeks.
 But the good news for Northwestern’s offense is that Purdue’s defense is allowing 466 yards per game and is ranked 11th in the league.
 This would be a good time to make the improvements Fitzgerald identified.

Thananchat retains the WBC Asian title with victory over oldie Pigmy Kokietgym. Pigmy has a wealth of experience but that was no substitute for the 6” height difference and the youth of Thananchat. The younger man was able to score well at distance with Pigmy just too slow to get close enough to work inside. Thananchat showed good skills a fast jab and variety in his punches switching smoothly from head to body. Pigmy just kept rolling forward smiling through the counters he was eating. That ended in the fourth when a left hook to the body dropped him to his knees. He was up at eight but another left hook to the body sent him down again and he was counted out. Thananchat looked very useful. He is 20 and after an early defeat has won ten on the bounce eight by KO/TKO including a victory over formerly world rated Kompayak. Pigmy (Wicha Phulaikhao) had his best days as a minimumweight losing twice in challenges for the WBA title but at 5’1” and 39 his days of making 105lbs are behind him.

As the coronavirus spread across the United States in the spring, and large processing plants became short-staffed, beef prices at grocery stores soared. In April, ground beef prices were 10% higher than they were a year earlier, according to Labor Department statistics.
 Meanwhile, prices for live cattle dropped around the same time, according to the Wall Street Journal.
 A group of state attorneys general didn't think the price drop was just because of slowdowns at the big plants. They asked President Donald Trump to start the Justice Department antitrust investigation that is now underway, calling for "regulatory strategies … to promote competition, address market manipulation and protect consumers."
 That means keeping cattle and beef prices fair and steady, making it easier for small slaughter companies to open up shop and keeping the big ones from buying them out.
 At nearly $10 a pound, grass-fed ground beef produced by Grassroots sells for about twice as much as grain-fed beef at a major grocery store. That makes it unaffordable for many customers. Hopkins said the higher prices are because they spend more on farmer wages, environmental costs, welfare costs, and other factors.
 As long as American consumers demand cheap meat that's available year-round, there will always be a need for large meat producers, Thistlethwaite said.
 "But it's quite possible that the American consumer could change their tastes, just as they've moved from wanting to buy gigantic cars, you know. They're increasingly moving to smaller cars and electric cars."
 But still, on principle, Cody is wary of his business growing too big.
 "I'm not sure what I would do if Jeff Bezos called me," he said, laughing. "It's a slippery slope. We feel … pretty strong about keeping that direct connection with our customers."

Thankfully, at the times when I was at my lowest and suffering from extreme burnout, I was able to surround myself with a great support system of people who had been there, done that, and had advice and tips to pick me up and help me get organized. I also discovered my “Failure Muscle”, something that you need to flex so you can fail forward and fail fast! Entrepreneurs learn to leverage failure because we practice it a hell of a lot more than everyone else. Failure is an important part of the learning process that you just can’t get away from, so getting good at embracing it is key. Every successful entrepreneur needs a great mentor to help guide them through those rough patches, and a team of people you can rely on to get the job done allowing you to free up time for self-care and family.

Two bipartisan groups representing state election officials said in a recent statement that ballots had been “safely and securely cast.”
 Ahead of Election Day, the pandemic upended longstanding voting plans and forced election officials to make systemic changes largely on the fly. They did so with limited federal money to cover increased costs for mail ballots, which take more staff and money to send, process and count.
 After problems erupted during spring primaries, the nation worried whether election officials could pull off a problem-free presidential election during a pandemic while confronting the threat of foreign interference from sophisticated adversaries led by Russia.
 “In the spring, there were just so many challenges we were facing, and we were just wondering how we were going to manage to do it,” said Larry Norden, an elections expert with the Brennan Center for Justice. “It’s an incredible story.”
 Long before a single ballot was cast, Trump raised questions about the integrity of the election and railed against mail voting despite a long history of mail ballots being used successfully in this country. At one point, he claimed the only way he could lose was if the election were rigged.
 Some states that expanded mail-in voting to make it safer to cast a ballot during the virus outbreak lean Republican and voted for Trump — Nebraska, North Dakota and Montana. He has raised no concerns about the results there.

Adams touched on several positive notes during his address, noting Pfizer just recently announced progress in its vaccine development. He said he anticipates officials will be ready to begin giving vaccines to the public late this year or early 2021, with wide-spread availability coming later.
 A “new normal” may be possible by late spring or early summer, Adams said. However, he urged people to continue to follow health guidelines in the meantime to limit the effects of the coronavirus and keep hospitals from getting overwhelmed.
 “We can stay open, but the way we stay open is by following health public measures," Adams said. "Which is why I’m out here in South Dakota, across the country, away from my family, pleading with the people of South Dakota, to go to the state’s Department of Health website. Look at the numbers, understand that they’re going out of control. And not just here, but across the country. That we’re worried about hospitalizations going up. Understand that we’re almost to a vaccine. We’re tired, but a finish line is in sight.”
 Adams said some parts of the world have already progressed without a vaccine.
 “I also want to remind people that Asia is open for business right now, and they don’t have a vaccine,” Adams said. “They’ve been able to do it with basic public health measures.”
 Throughout his address, Adams returned to a common theme - “Do the right thing” - and do what you can to help fight COVID-19.
 “What I would say to governors, is think about your citizenry, and do all you can to follow these public health measures," Adams said, when asked about what he would tell governors and other leaders about how to respond to the pandemic. "By coming here today, and helping people understand that cases are rising, that whether or not there’s a mask mandate in South Dakota - that more people will do the right thing, and get us to a vaccine.”
