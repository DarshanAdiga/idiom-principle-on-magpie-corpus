Identification of the weaknesses and strengths of different institutions cam help optimise investment and specialisation. Technology and digital learning must then be leveraged to the maximum to disseminate specialised knowledge and enhance the learning outcomes of students while ensuring their access to technology. Investments may be optimised by increasing the existing the capacities of institutions in their respective specialised areas. The mantra should be to give access of quality learning to all who desire to learn. Our current stereotyped westernised system of education has all along ignored the abundant traditional knowledge and inter-generational expertise available indigenously across regions and to use such knowledge for addressing local needs and problems. Any holistic system of education must integrate such knowledge not only to improve local livelihood but also to teach important cultural, societal and humanistic values to youth. Knowledge must be free and free-flowing to prevent fragmentation of the world so that the spirit of human inquiry would not lose “its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit” and the mind would be led forward into “ever-widening thought and action” which is the ultimate aim of any holistic education.

Living with nature can be a beautiful, peaceful experience, but not always. Some weeks, it can feel like the farm is under attack, and this was one of them.
 It started on Friday, when I left Farmstead right after closing time and all the delicious to-go dinners had been picked up. Dusk was arriving, and it was time for evening chores. It seems like that time draws earlier and earlier each day noticeably as autumn approaches. I had herded all the ducks in their houses, locked the doors on the pullets and young turkeys, and was just closing in the adult turkeys when I heard squawking from the laying hens out in their mobile housing in the pasture.

The third time the tire pressure warning light lit up, I decided there must be an issue beyond normal air loss. I drove slowly to a tire shop near home and asked them to check the left rear for a leak.

When the sun is in just the right (wrong) position in the sky, our long-term 2013 Tesla Model S throws a big-time glare right in your face. The source? The flat, highly polished chrome-like arm that anchors the side-view mirror to the car. This is no little dazzle, either. It's really obnoxious. I noticed this on the return leg of my road trip as I was heading south on I-5.

Look at the tire again, ignoring, if you can, the mangled inside edge. Concentrate on the face of it. The tire looks to be somewhat evenly worn across its width, with maybe a little less tread depth at the inner wear bar than the outer one.

Over a dozen protesters were arrested Saturday morning after trying to steal police checkpoint barriers in Jerusalem, according to the police spokesperson.
 The group allegedly arrived in two trucks in order to pack up the barriers. Police arrested 13 suspects and they were taken in for questioning, while the two trucks were seized. Nine of the suspects are expected to be brought before Jerusalem Magistrate's Court in the evening.
 The Israel Police spokesperson said following the incident that it "takes seriously the attempt of the suspects to endanger the security of thousands of demonstrators, and allegedly steal the police checkpoint [barriers] at the site, whose entire purpose is to assist in the security and safety of the demonstrators, especially in light of existing threats to prevent terrorist incidents."

When you step back from this situation, it's clear that EPR's business is slowly starting to work back from a devastating hit as its experiential lessees begin to reopen for business. Things are definitely getting better today, and there's turnaround potential here for more aggressive types. However, there's still material risk at EPR, since some of its largest customers are financially troubled and at a very real risk of tumbling into bankruptcy if their businesses don't pick up quickly enough. At the end of the day, there are still troubling risks here, and EPR is not an appropriate option for risk-averse dividend investors hoping that the REIT's monthly payment will quickly return.

Monday, Sept. 7, marks the nation’s 126th observance of Labor Day. This year, the day carries unique meaning as our labor force battles to maintain some economic stability while dealing with the risks of the pandemic coronavirus.
 The day’s history goes back way before 1894, the year President Grover Cleveland signed the bill making the first Monday in September a nationwide observance. In the 1830s, workers in America’s manufacturing firms were forced into long hours in unsafe conditions within the mills and factories of the Industrial Revolution. The workload and poor conditions, inhumane by modern standards, took their toll on workers’ health.
 Unionized workers in New York City declared a one-day strike to discuss their common need for shorter work hours and better treatment on the job, and the movement spread across the country, spurring businesses to give employees a day of rest each week and make other changes. And business owners found out treating workers better turned out to be good for business, too — workers found themselves with more time for traveling, attending entertainment events or dining out with their families, helping the nation’s economy expand beyond farming and manufacturing basic goods.
 In other words, one of the results of the labor movement that began more than 100 years ago was to show that safe and healthy workplace environments need not be considered a barrier to economic prosperity. The two can exist in tandem.

While certain things like wine, classic cars and mint-condition superhero comic books generally get better with age, our 2016 Tesla Model X is not one of those things. Thank the brutality of city driving, but also maybe a little bit of excessive function creep. Problems stemmed from automatic door issues (and not the falcon-wing doors, mind you) and a substantial "sqwuank" noise from the brakes.

It appears that things were reasonably OK for a decent amount of time, and then something went horribly wrong. At some point the extreme inside edge began wearing at an entirely different angle, as if the tires suddenly got thrust into some kind of weird pencil sharpener.

"Also, it generally seems more nervous and jumpy even when no changes are in the works for miles and miles. Regular Autopilot feels confident (overconfident, I would say), but Autopilot running under the Navigate on Autopilot feels like a paranoid student driver. It overreacts to non-events. All in all, I have zero confidence in it.

Six inches. That's how much ground clearance our 2013 Tesla Model S has according to the spec sheet. In light of recent events, Tesla is quick to point out this isn't terribly low compared to other cars. That's true on the face of it, but there's always more to this singular number than meets the eye.

In spite of threats that the postal service won’t deliver and claims by President Trump that mail-in voting isn’t safe, I applied for my ballot in light of the coronavirus risks. Yesterday I was pleased to see the familiar long thick envelope labeled “Official Document” in my mailbox.
 When I opened it a ballot-looking form from the “Republican” party and an envelope to send a donation back to them fell out. So the mail is safe enough to send money to reelect a man who has told innumerable lies but not safe enough for a legal election?
 This week, in North Carolina, he advised voters to vote twice, once by mail and once at the polls? Isn’t voting twice a felony? While I am asking questions when did soliciting money start to be an “Official Document?”

A lot of cars turn heads on the road but I've noticed that our 2013 Tesla Model S tends to attract attention from people who look like they could genuinely afford to buy one. That guy in the Mercedes-Benz S-Class who's crawling down the 10 freeway in bumper-to-bumper traffic in the lane next to me? Yeah, he's swiveling his head to get a look. Eyes on the road, buddy. People with means can be a pretty jaded bunch so it speaks well of the Model S that it's able to stand out and catch the eye of this hard-to-impress demographic.

Our hotel's Level 2 charger was a decided advantage, a necessity in fact. We needed the extra juice to make it to the track each day. And we needed to replace some of the miles we used getting to the track so we could get far enough down the road to reach the Supercharger network.

Andrew Twiggar, one of the driving forces behind the planning of a new hotel in Shamokin, said the fact that nearly everyone has a GPS at their fingertips has, to some degree, eliminated the long-held belief that location is everything in business and real estate.
 When it comes to the new hotel in Shamokin, the exact pin-point on the map doesn’t matter nearly as much as the ZIP code attached to the address.
 Looking to build off the continuing success of the nearby Anthracite Outdoor Adventure Area, Twiggar is part of a venture capital group pursuing a 65-room hotel — tentatively pegged as the Anthracite Hotel — in Shamokin.
 The proposed hotel got a boost this week when three zoning variances were approved. Permitting and financing are ongoing, so the property is moving closer to becoming a reality.
 For far too long the riders and outdoor enthusiasts from across the Mid- Atlantic have visited the Valley for fun, only to spend their valuable tourism dollars outside of Northumberland County mainly due to a lack of accommodations near the facility. The 8,000-acre site is located along Route 125, covering forest and reclaimed coal land in Coal, East Cameron, Mount Carmel, West Cameron and Zerbe townships.
 Despite the pandemic slowing down nearly everything, AOAA officials said last month they remain on track for a record year.

"My favorite part of the ride is that it is such a family friendly event.  I have had my son, Will, go with me on the ride for the last 6 years.  He will be 13 on this year's ride.  He started riding in front of me and then moved to behind me and now he drives me most of the ride.  I love the smooth water in the upper reaches of the lake.  It is the only time of the year that I get the chance to go all the way up there and it is my favorite ride of the year."

As of last week, our Tesla HPWC (High Power Wall Connector) is finally up and running. And it's fast. It can send electricity into our 2013 Tesla Model S's battery some 2.7 times faster than standard Level 2 charging equipment. That's because it's built to draw 80 amps through a 100-amp circuit instead of the usual 30 amps through a 40-amp breaker.

After some serious R&R;, our 2018 Toyota Camry stretched its legs to the tune of 2,300 miles since our last update. And not one of those miles is attributable to any rideshare service. The miles are actually courtesy of an Edmunds guest contributor with thoughts about the Camry he was eager to share. So we've decided to switch it up a bit for this month's episode of "Keeping Up With Camry."

Early media reports were all over the map, with accompanying photos depicting the High Powered Wall Connector (HPWC) or a Tesla Supercharger. Neither is involved. They're fine.

As he tells it, he couldn't miss the object, which subsequently passed under the car and made hard contact. "I felt a firm "thud" as the hitch struck the bottom of the car, and it felt as though it even lifted the car up in the air."


--DocBreak--
This was done because fuses were popping left and right inside the early HPWCs. Tesla sent out the charging restriction in one of their periodic over- the-air firmware updates as a temporary fix while they worked out a hardware solution.

We were leaning toward four because of the noise problem that cropped up recently. Tesla service surmised that odd (and subtle) heal-toe tire wear was playing a role after they conducted back-to-back test drives with new tires and wheels they had on the shelf.
