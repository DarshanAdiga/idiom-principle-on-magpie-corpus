Dear Dave,   I'm debt-free except for my home, and it is all because I started following your plan four years ago. I'm even on track to pay off my mortgage in eight years. With all the scary economic news out there, I'd love to talk to my family about following your advice, too. Do you have any suggestions for doing this without sounding like a know-it-all or that I am bragging?   Lacey
 Dear Lacey,   It's been my experience that when it comes to family, words don't always do the trick. There's an old saying that goes, "Those convinced against their will are of the same opinion still." Some people have been brainwashed into believing credit cards and debt are an unavoidable part of life. They're stuck in their ways, and nothing anyone can say or do is going to change that.   I've been fortunate enough to help millions of people change their lives, get out of debt and take control of their finances. But there are millions more who will never listen. They'll just keep going deeper and deeper into debt, and never realize the real problem is the person they see in the mirror every morning.   The truth is, you can make irrefutable arguments against credit cards. People who use them spend more than those who use cash or debit cards. Research has proven this. You don't need one to rent a car, get a hotel room, or buy airline tickets. A debit card will do all those things without piling up debt. For an emergency fund, you can simply save up cash. It takes some discipline and hard work, but relying on credit when things go wrong is a really bad idea. It's a trap.   If they won't listen to all these truths, try telling them your story. Let them know you understand from experience how hard breaking old habits can be. Emphasize how amazing your life has been since you decided to actively control your money, instead allowing a lack of money to control you.   Congratulations, Lacey. I'm proud of you for working so hard and being disciplined. I hope you can be an influence on others in your family, and help lead them to a place of financial peace, too!   Dave

From there, he hit the ground running with the Ducks, becoming the first true freshman to start at QB since Chris Miller in 1983. In his first year, he went 2-6, racking up 1,936 passing yards and 19 passing touchdowns. However, he couldn't completely turn around the team, as the Ducks went 4-8 and failed to make a Bowl Game appearance. In 2017, he came back from a collarbone victory and was named the Ducks' Offensive MVP after throwing for 1,983 yards, 15 touchdowns and five interceptions, completely 67 percent of his throws.

However, due to the extremely demanding study protocol mandated by the FDA, the recruitment process will likely take a considerable amount of time. Following successful FDA approval, Ameluz would be the only drug in the United States for the treatment of superficial BCC tumor indication with PDT. Actinic keratosis is still considered a precursor to a tumor, and as such the approval for BCC will allow Ameluz to be recognized as a stronger drug.

But I made the switch for a couple of reasons. Anthony Lynn doesn’t view—at least now—Tyrod Taylor as a bridge quarterback. He thinks he can be a good NFL starter. And with the business side of football so up in the air in 2020 because of the pandemic, I think it’s more important to build the best football team rather than have the best marketing plan. The Chargers have 31-year-old Bryan Bulaga—who has missed 13 games in the last three years—at one of the tackles, and no other solid guy on the roster. I hear the Chargers are planning to use Bulaga at right tackle. So they’re absolutely denuded on the left side of the line, and here’s the first-team all-American left tackle from the SEC sitting there for them. A Telesco team to be so bereft of building blocks at tackle is not good. And the Chargers have loved Thomas, a legit two-year left tackle at Georgia against the highest level of competition in the college game, throughout the fall and winter.

STATESBORO - Georgia Southern men's basketball coach Brian Burg named Shawn Forrest, Chris Shumate and Tim MacAllister as his assistant coaches on Monday.
   
 "I am really excited about the staff we have put together," Burg said. "These guys are proven winners with a non-ego mentality. They embody the blue-collar mentality that we embrace here at Georgia Southern."
   
 Forrest is a 22-year coaching veteran, a tenure which includes stops at current Sun Belt schools Louisiana, Arkansas State and Troy and former members Western Kentucky and North Texas. Most recently, Forrest spent three seasons (2016-19) at SMU, where he helped the Mustangs to a 30-5 record in 2016-17. SMU went 18-0 at home that season, won The American regular-season and tournament titles and advanced to the NCAA Tournament. SMU was ranked in the Associated Press Top-25 for the last six weeks of the season and finished 11th in the poll.
   
 Forrest was also instrumental in the development of three NBA draft picks during his tenure at SMU, Semi Ojeleye, Sterling Brown and Shake Milton.
   
 Forrest spent three seasons at Western Kentucky (2013-16), helping the Hilltoppers to consecutive 20-win seasons, and mentored NBA draft picks Elfrid Payton and Shawn Long at Louisiana in 2012-13. He helped North Texas to four consecutive 20-plus win seasons (2008-12) and coached NBA Draft selection Tony Mitchell. The Mean Green won the 2010 Sun Belt Tournament, earning the league's bid to the NCAA Tournament.
   
 Forrest is the all-time leading NCAA Division I scorer at Arkansas Pine Bluff University.
   
 "Shawn Forrest is a proven coach and relentless recruiter," said Burg. "Throughout his career, he has won championships and helped develop student- athletes. The knowledge he has acquired over a 20-year Division I career is invaluable."
   
 Shumate is a 12-year coaching veteran having been on staffs at University of Cincinnati, Southern Miss, University of Tennessee, Western Kentucky University and Northern Kentucky University. In 2007, Shumate joined the staff at Cincinnati with his former college coach, Mick Cronin. From 2007-2013, he was a part of three NCAA Tournament teams and one Sweet 16.
   
 He went on to coach at Southern Miss in 2013-2014 and win the Conference USA regular-season championship and an NIT appearance. He then spent the next couple of seasons as an assistant coach at Tennessee and Western Kentucky.
   
 Most recently, Shumate was an assistant coach at Northern Kentucky from 2016-2019, the most successful three-year stretch in school history as the Norse reached two NCAA Tournaments, one NIT and won two Horizon League regular-season championships. In the 2016-2017 season, Northern Kentucky became the first school in NCAA history to make the NCAA Tournament in their first season of tournament eligibility, winning 24 games that year.
   
 During Shumate's playing and coaching career, he has been a part of seven NCAA Tournament teams, one Sweet 16 team and three NIT teams. He has been a part of conference championships in the OVC, Big East, Conference USA and Horizon League. Shumate had a very successful playing career at Murray State from 1999-2004 followed by two seasons professionally in the NBA D-League.
   
 "Chris Shumate is a tremendous basketball coach who has competed and won championships throughout his entire career," Burg said. "He is well respected in the coaching profession, and he has a tireless work ethic. I am thrilled to add someone of Chris' caliber to our program."
   
 MacAllister comes to Statesboro from Texas Tech, where he served as the program's Chief of Staff and along with Burg, helped lead the Red Raiders to the 2019 NCAA National Championship final and to the Big 12 Conference regular-season championship. MacAllister was named to the NABC's 2019 Under Armour 30-Under-30 Team, a group selected as 30 of the most outstanding men's college basketball coaches under the age of 30.
   
 MacAllister has appeared in five NCAA Tournaments during his career, worked with four All-Americans and seen four players selected in the NBA Draft -- Murray State's Isaiah Canaan in 2013, Creighton's Justin Patton in 2017, Khyri Thomas in 2018 and Texas Tech's Jarrett Culver in 2019.
   
 He spent three seasons at Creighton, where he helped the Bluejays to an NIT in 2016, followed by consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances in 2017 and 2018.
   
 MacAllister also served as a Security Forces Staff Sergeant in the US Air National Guard from 2007-2013.
   
 He served as a student assistant at Murray State (2010-13) and spent a season at Emory University in Atlanta where he worked as an assistant to Jason Zimmerman. The Eagles won at No. 1 Wisconsin-Stevens Point to reach the Division III Elite Eight before falling to eventual national champion Wisconsin-Whitewater. While at Emory, he worked with a pair of All-American post players.
   
 "Tim MacAllister is one of the most detailed and organized individuals I have worked with in my coaching career," Burg said. "He has the winning intangibles that embody Georgia Southern basketball, and success has followed him throughout his coaching career."

The May '20 WTI contract rebounded on Tuesday morning, but the June '20 WTI contract, the new front month contract is tanking, indicating that producers could be about to face much more pain the coming month.   Chart of the Week WTI closed at -$37 per barrel on Monday, the first time it has ever closed in negative territory. The development reflects traders trying not to get stuck with physical delivery for May as the contract expires on Tuesday. But the hot potato chaos also reflects a fundamental lack of storage. June WTI contracts are trading at a more reasonable but still catastrophic $9.40 per barrel as of 1155 AM CT on Tuesday. Market Movers BP NYSE BP refineries are operating well below normal rates. Its Toledo, OH refinery is down nearly 30 percent, and its Whiting, IN refinery is 17 percent below capacity. Phillips 66 NYSE PSX was upgraded to Buy by Bank of America while PBF Energy NYSE PBF was downgraded to Neutral. Halliburton NYSE HAL cut spending by $1 billion and also posted a $1 billion loss for the first quarter. Tuesday April 21, 2020 In a historic first, WTI closed in negative territory on Monday, or -$37.63 to be exact. The decline comes as the WTI contract for May expires on Tuesday. Analysts differed over the significance, since the expiring contract becomes increasingly irrelevant. But on Tuesday, the June and July contracts began to collapse as well, deepening the crisis for the oil industry. Trump calls for bailout. In a tweet on Tuesday, President Trump said "We will never let the great U.S. Oil & Gas Industry down. I have instructed the Secretary of Energy and Secretary of the Treasury to formulate a plan which will make funds available so that these very important companies and jobs will be secured long into the future" For now, it is unclear what form such government help will take, although a week ago, Bloomberg reported that the Department of Energy was considering a plan to pay shale drillers not to produce. Saudi Arabia considers cuts sooner. Saudi Arabia may cut as soon as possible, rather than waiting for May, according to the Wall Street Journal. "Something has to be done about this bloodbath," said a Saudi official familiar with the matter. "But it might be a little bit too late." Trump considers halting Saudi imports. The U.S. celebrated the OPEC deal a week ago, but with oil prices collapsing once again, the Trump administration may consider limits on imports. "We certainly have plenty of oil, so I'll take a look at it," he said. Trump wants to fill SPR. On Monday, Trump once again pushed for filling up the SPR. "This is a great time to buy oil...Nobody's ever heard of negative oil before." Oil industry lobbying for Fed help. The U.S. oil and gas industry "has asked the Federal Reserve to change the terms of a $600 billion lending facility so that oil and gas companies can use the funds to repay their ballooning debts," Reuters reported. Premium Oil Storage Nears Its Limit Alberta calls for help. The Canadian government announced a C$2.45 billion aid package for Canada's energy sector last week. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said the province needs more. "More support is needed to deal with the crisis in Canada's energy sector, but this is a great first step," Kenney said. "Our energy sector is facing its biggest challenge ever, and we need to be sure that industry can access the capital it needs to survive and thrive in future years." Saudi oil stored at sea. At least one in 10 supertankers is storing oil at sea, and some of those cargoes originated from Saudi Arabia, according to the Wall Street Journal. "The kingdom is now facing a situation where they may have to shut parts in their production, likely from Ghawar and others because they don't have buyers," a senior Aramco executive told the WSJ. "The fact is buyers don't have storage so regardless of whatever level of output you want, there won't be storage for it." Canada cuts steam-driven oil projects. Steam-assisted gravity drainage SAGD oil projects in Canada are facing shut ins and the curtailment could cause permanent damage. ConocoPhillips NYSE COP cut output by 100,000 bpd, while Husky Energy TSE HSE and Cenovus Energy NYSE CVE cut production by 15,000 bpd and 45,000 bpd, respectively. Total Canadian shut ins could total 1.5 mb\/d, according to TD Bank. Halliburton cuts $1 billion. Halliburton is cutting jobs, cutting capex by $1 billion and warning of a steep downturn. "We expect activity in North America land to sharply decline during [Q2] and remain depressed through year-end, impacting all basins," CEO Jeff Miller said. "Activity is in free fall in North America." Premium The Oil Sector That Will Suffer The Most Oil industry loses 51,000 jobs. An estimated 51,000 jobs were lost in the oil industry in March, a 9 percent reduction that will surely grow much more severe in the weeks ahead. "We're looking at anywhere between five and seven years of job growth wiped out in a month," Philip Jordan, VP at BW Research Partnership, a research consultancy, told Bloomberg. "What makes it sort of scary is this really is just the beginning. April is not looking good for oil and gas." WoodMac Non-OPEC supply to fall by 4 mb\/d by end-2021. Wood Mackenzie updated its forecast for supply declines, noting that cut backs are happening faster than the firm thought just a few weeks ago. India's fuel demand plummets by 50%. India's demand for all fuels fell by 50 percent in April. Russia orders companies to cut 20 percent. Russia's energy ministry told domestic oil producers to cut oil production by 20 percent from February levels, a sign that Moscow intends to follow through on the OPEC deal. China doubles stockpiling. China doubled the fill rate at its strategic and commercial inventories in Q1 2020, with some 2 mb\/d of oil not processed by refiners in the first quarter. Whiting Petroleum gets delisting warning. Whiting Petroleum NYSE WLL was given a delisting notice from the NYSE because its share price is in danger of trading below $1 per share for a 30-day period.

With many young doctors being trained in VA hospitals and being able to experience Ameluz PDT, we will be able to use this platform to educate a new generation of opinion leaders and innovation drivers in dermatology about the advantages of PDT in combination with Ameluz. Despite the currently still very low business volume, the VA market remains a strategically important market. Just yesterday, we signed a final license agreement with Maruho under which we grant Maruho a license to commercialize Ameluz in East Asia and Oceania. Given the nature of the Asian dermatology market, Maruho has a particular interest in the acne indication. Maruho will make an upfront payment of €6 million as well as further milestone payments. Furthermore, we will receive royalties initially of 6% for any revenues recorded in their territory included in the agreement. Royalty rates will increase with the larger sales and decrease if and when generic drugs hit the market. We are very happy that our strategic partnership with Maruho continues to the benefit of both parties.
