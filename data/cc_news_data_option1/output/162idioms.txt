But that one ended up in the exact same city against the same team. LSU beat Clemson 7-0 in the New Orleans Sugar Bowl that season. On Monday night, a few more points were scored.

Even Sunday night, King was part of team activities as the Cougars returned to campus for the start of the spring semester.      Then, it what was a possibility all along, King reversed course and announced late Monday night that he will enter the transfer portal.

Alabama Hannah, ever the good pageant queen, departed without any fuss, but it begs the question of what we should keep our eyes on as the rest of the season progresses: Does she return with a vengeance after getting her Mirrorball Trophy and surprise even _more_ group dates? Or dare we say, wreak _complete_ and _utter_ havoc during Weber’s final rose proposal? We can’t help but think about the unprecedented teaser footage we’ve already been shown of Weber’s proposal, where Chris Harrison stops him ⁠— Neil Lane sparkler in hand ⁠— to pass along some ominous information. “Before you do what you’re about to do, there’s something you should know,” he tells Weber. “I’m not sure how this all ends, so I just wanted to give you a heads up.”

When I was about 10 years old, growing up as the son of two Chicago public school teachers, my mother strongly advised me to “get into the newspaper habit.” Our house took The Tribune daily and Sunday. On my own, I often added a look at The Sun-Times off a newsstand.
 My wife, Paula, apparently also caught the habit. We have been subscribers to The Herald-Dispatch ever since our arrival in the area 25 years ago. And, just as I did back in Chicago, I often add a look at another paper, typically The Charleston Gazette-Mail.
 Logical enough, you might say, for a person with a journalism background. And a self-confessed news junkie. OK, true; however that’s not Paula’s case. Yet she is a faithful reader of The H-D and an avid listener to West Virginia Public Radio and NPR.
 For my part I have also added an online subscription to The Washington Post, as well as occasional dives into such online services as The Guardian, Politico, Slate and others.
 As a television outlet for news and airing opinions and commentary of all sides, C-SPAN has my deepest respect. I’ll not hide that I watch the discussion shows on PBS, MSNBC and CNN more than I do those on Fox. But I do indeed receive the decidedly conservative Newsmax service online and that keeps me posted on rightwing perspectives.
 Today, I fear, too few Americans regularly follow the news. They may catch glimpses of this or that on Facebook, but often without even recognizing the source of a particular news item.
 In short, we lack discipline and adequate appreciation of the vital importance of “keeping up.”
 Such lazy habits are a good way to aid and abet dark forces operating in the world to spread disinformation and outright conspiracy theories, some made up out of whole cloth.
 In gathering material for this column I exercise due discretion and, when in doubt about a source or the reliability of a piece of information, I double check. I’m not always careful enough and thus, over the years, I’ve caught myself publishing errors of fact. Most of the time, I catch a glitch on my own, flag it to the H-D editors and write my own correction to be inserted into the paper.
 Having written more than 700 columns for this newspaper, I am glad to say instances of the editors or myself having to print a correction have been limited to fewer than the fingers on two hands.

Most people would probably take it easy if they had a heart pump but Featherstone’s idea of “taking it easy” involved “more teaching and less actual gardening”.

This is absurd! From what the news released, the Huntington Board of Zoning Appeals in July 2019 issued and zoned the Kulture Club facility and gave a permit to owner Charon Reese. Did they not do a background check and see she had already had an arrest record?
 I also understood a reporter referring to the Kulture Club as a hooka establishment also. Did the city not do their homework either? Hooka is a type of pipe smoking of illicit products or tobacco and that is banned from establishments by city and state health departments. Who monitors or researches the license/permit/zoning boards? The health department does not have the staff to go by places at night.
 The news showed cans of alcohol; is this a bring your own drink establishment?
 This is total bizarre!
 Why does the city not care about our downtown establishments? Apparently the $1 million the city won was not used to keep a clean city.
 Huntington’s government needs to clean up this city and clean it up fast! Start with the mayor and go down the line if they don’t want to run a clean city!
