Regardless of paternity, it's easy to make the case that this is everyone's sequester now: White House idea, passed with overwhelming GOP votes, allowed to kick in only because of the failure of a bipartisan "supercommittee" and because, in the 18 months since then, compromise to replace it has been elusive. Part of the reason Boehner is working so hard to make sure everyone knows the idea originated from the White House is many House Republicans have said in no uncertain terms they want the sequester to go ahead. And polls show that if it does, Republicans will get the blame. Boehner would really prefer if it didn't turn out that way.

 # A victory for my granddaughters
 Larry Little
 Columnist
 My wife and I have eight granddaughters, ranging in age from two to 22. One of my favorite jobs is taking two of the younger ones, age five and seven, to and from school, a task I perform fairly regularly. While they typically attend public school, this year is unique, and the private school they enrolled at is open, with classes mostly held outside. They appear to be thriving in an atmosphere that from all reports seems to encourage the best in and from them.
 Their current fixations on “Harry Potter” and cake videos interfered — not to mention their ages — but the week of October 12 through 16 presented a remarkable and first-of-its-kind opportunity for them to witness. A woman expanded the range of possibilities for their future.
 I write of Amy Coney Barrett.
 From my nearly 50 years as a lawyer, I found her answers to the Senators’ questions in virtually all cases greatly exceeded the quality of the questions; and she educated and re-educated them and me on concepts, as well as case precedent. She is obviously a textualist and originalist in the mold of former Justice Antonin Scalia, with a mind likely at least the equal of any current justice of that highest court. However, I predict she will surprise many partisans of the left and right, and rarely embrace a cause or advocate. She will instead adjudicate cases, not advocate causes disguised as adjudication. Her opinions may well align with others, not so much on an ideological basis, but on a deference to precedent basis. It is ironic that she replaces another brilliant mind, of a completely different legal persuasion, and one who on issues meaningful to her, often advocated from the bench, namely Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
 Yet it is not with my legal hat on, rather with the mind and the heart of a grandfather, that I reflect on what her likely confirmation may mean to the young girls of today who may well be candidates to succeed her, and others like her, in the not too distant future.
 The judiciary committee chairman, Sen. Lindsey Graham, summed up one possible long-range impact of Judge Barrett’s nomination when he said early the morning of Oct. 14:
 “It is a very give and take society called America, but there’s one group in America I think has had a hard time of it and that’s conservatives of color and women conservatives. There’s an effort by some in the liberal world to marginalize the contribution because you come out on a different side of an issue, particularly abortion. So this hearing to me is an opportunity to not punch through a glass ceiling, but a reinforced concrete barrier around conservative women. …You’ve been candid to this body about who you are, what you believe. You’ve been reinsuring in your disposition and this is history being made, folks. This is the first time in American history that we’ve nominated a woman who’s unashamedly pro-life and embraces her faith without apology and she’s going to the court. A seat at the table is waiting on you. And it will be a great signal to all young women who share your view of the world that there’s a seat at the table for them. This won’t be celebrated in most places. It’d be hard to find much commentary about this moment in American history, but in many of our worlds, this’ll be celebrated. This has been a long time coming and we have arrived.”
 In addition, when he, a conservative, later hugged Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a liberal, I thought that just maybe there was what in Camelot terms was a “…brief shining moment.”
 Writing in the Wall Street Journal the next day, Daniel Henninger captured an even deeper significance of her nomination, and an important underlying issue in the upcoming election.
 “Chasing Christians into the underground went out in the fourth century, but with Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination it has apparently been necessary to revive it in 21st century America…There is something about her that is threateningly traditional — the big family, the unapologetic Midwest wholesomeness, a faith that extends beyond going to church on Sunday….[The threat is] that others who share or who are attracted to her active religiosity might be rising out there in the country to pose a threat to the secular dominance of America’s mores that began some 60 years ago.”
 If Judge Barrett is confirmed, it’s a victory for diversity in so many respects. Her life and career carries Justice Ginsburg’s torch, simply more quietly, and in a different hand. She provides another wonderful role model, and options for all granddaughters.
 If you haven’t done so already, I encourage you to familiarize yourself with the issues and the candidates, and then vote.

The government has warned that other regions could follow as it battles to get a grip on a second wave of Covid-19.
 Britain has been the worst-hit in Europe by the virus, registering nearly 45,000 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.
 After a summer lull transmission is rising again, especially in northern England, with more than 20,000 new cases announced Friday.
 But Prime Minister Boris Johnson has resisted calls for a second national lockdown, arguing his tiered system is better suited to target regions facing the biggest threat.
 \- 'Digital Christmas' - On Thursday, the government improved a national jobs- support scheme after businesses hit by regional lockdowns claimed it did not go far enough to replace a furlough package that expires this month.
 The Treasury did not divulge the overall cost but Johnson promised "billions more".
 Meanwhile Scotland, which like Wales has its own devolved government, announced a new five-tier plan of localised measures.
 First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has already extended the closure of pubs and restaurants in the centre of Scotland for a third week to November 2\.
 But outlining the five tiers, she insisted that the country was "not back at square one" and that "we do not envisage returning to a situation as severe as the first lockdown".
 Scots in the capital Edinburgh seemed unconvinced by the latest changes.
 "It's just making it too difficult to be honest so I don't know if they're going to be that useful, student Megan Davis, 20, said.

In doing so, the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals panel left intact a judge’s ruling this month to let the race go on despite the death of one of three candidates on the ballot. The death of Legal Marijuana Now Party nominee Adam Weeks put federal law around congressional election timing in conflict with a state law that postponed an election in such a circumstance.
 Republican Tyler Kistner had asked the appeals panel to defer to the state law, which would result in a February special election. Democratic Rep. Angie Craig argued that federal law should prevail in this instance.
 In the three-judge panel’s ruling, Judge Steven Colloton wrote that Kistner was unlikely to win the case on its merits.
 “Even if the death of a Republican or Democratic-Farmer-Labor candidate could qualify as an exigent circumstance that would allow the state to cancel an election and trigger a vacancy in office, we think it unlikely that the rationale would extend to the death of a third-party candidate from a party with the modest electoral strength exhibited to date by the Legal Marijuana Now Party in Minnesota,” Colloton wrote.

By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and April Joyner
 NEW YORK, Oct 23 (Reuters) - With less than two weeks to go before the U.S. presidential election, investors may be placing too much confidence in a decisive win by Democratic challenger Joe Biden as his lead in opinion polls narrows.
 Market participants have in recent weeks pulled back from bets that would benefit from election-related volatility while piling into assets that would benefit from a Biden win, including alternative energy shares and cannabis stocks.
 As Biden's lead has narrowed in recent days, some market watchers worry that an unexpected victory by President Donald Trump, a Republican, or an uncertain election outcome could force the type of violent positioning unwinds that occurred in 2016, when investors were overwhelmingly positioned for a Hillary Clinton presidency.
 In betting markets, Trump's chances of winning the election increased about 1 percentage point to 36.3% following Thursday's debate, but Biden maintains a significant lead, with a 64.4% chance of winning the election, according to data from RealClearPolitics.
 "To some extent the markets are under-appreciating the likelihood of a Trump rebound here," said Karl Schamotta, chief global strategist at Cambridge Global Payments.
 Following the election, traders expect the biggest market swings to occur in equities. Among the assets vulnerable to violent moves is the Invesco Solar ETF. The exchange-traded fund has risen about 24% over the last month as investors anticipate that clean energy policies under a Biden administration would bode well for the sector.
 Options prices suggest the ETF's shares could log a one-day move of as much as 11% in either direction once the election results are out, according to calculations by Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group.
 The technology-heavy Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF and the S&amp;P 500 tracking ETF SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust are each primed for a move of about 3% to 4%, Murphy said.
 An unexpected Trump win could also hit currencies such as the Mexican peso and Russian ruble, while boosting the battered U.S. dollar, analysts said.
 Utility firms, tax-exempt municipal bonds, industrials and material stocks may also be vulnerable, said Justin Waring, investment strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management.
 Treasury yields, which move inversely to prices, rose to four-month highs on Friday, a day after Biden and Trump squared off in a final debate that some observers said was unlikely to improve the incumbent's re-election prospects.
 Some investors believe a Biden win could usher in higher spending and weigh on bonds.
 Some market watchers have also noted that investors, while still far more hedged against markets swings than in the 2016 election cycle, have pared bets on wild stock market gyrations over the past two weeks.
 S&amp;P 500 options expiring in December are implying a more muted level of stock swings than they did just two weeks ago, suggesting expectations for market turmoil following the election have come in.
 Equity and interest-rate options "are pricing in that Biden wins the presidential election," said Amy Wu Silverman, equity derivatives strategist at RBC Capital Markets. "They're fairly complacent on that, as well as the idea of a 'blue sweep.'"
 While the market fears of election-related volatility have receded somewhat, by no means have investors sounded the all-clear signal. The Cboe Volatility Index, known as Wall Street's "fear gauge," stands above 28, significantly higher than the low to mid-teen range it was trading in just prior to the 2016 presidential election.
 An uncertain or contested election would likely result in even more sustained volatility. The S&amp;P 500 slipped as much as 10% in the weeks following the 2000 election, before the Supreme Court decided the hotly-contested battle between George W. Bush and Al Gore for the presidency.
 Such a period of uncertainty could hit the market's biggest winners, including the technology and momentum stocks that have been a key driver of the S&amp;P 500's rebound, said Joseph Amato, president and chief investment officer of equities at Neuberger Berman Group PLC.
 "If you have a risk-off environment because of a contested election then you probably have vulnerability on those stocks that have done the best," Amato said. "Quite often in a risk-off scenario you often sell your big winners first." (Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and April Joyner; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Nick Zieminski)

When I was a kid, I used to play football. When our defensive team was on the field most of the game, we usually lost. However almost every time, when our offense had the ball longer and was scoring, we won the game. In the cyber world, we are always playing defense.
 With the current administration, the national strategy of how to deal with “advanced persistent threats” and organized cyber-crime has been turned upside down. From a recent Washington Post article, the commander of U.S. Cyber Command and the NSA, Gen. Paul Kakasone, refers to the new way of handling hackers as “persistent engagement.” The idea is to impose a cumulative cost on the adversary by keeping them constantly engaged. With this shift in paradigm, we go from responding to wherever we are attacked, to proactively searching attackers and disrupting their operations.
 Gen. Kakasone did this recently by disrupting Trickbot botnet operation, run by a Russian-speaking cyber-crime organization. The Trickbot botnet has an army of at least 1 million hijacked computers from around the world. Trickbot is malware that steals financial data and drop other malicious software onto infected systems. The hijacked computers send out messages to the command and control servers and await their instructions. These bots also send malware to other computers to infect and steal financial data or hold them hostage with ransomware.
 Last month the Trickbot botnet attacked Universal Health Services, locking their systems with the Ryuk ransomware. This caused over 400 facilities to revert to manual and paper records. The attack caused some facilities to turn patients away. However, on September 22nd, the tables were turned on Trickbot and there was a disruption of their command and control servers. Someone hacked the hacker’s servers, severing the connections between the bots and the command and control servers. The hackers recovered and restarted operations in a day. A similar attack occurred on October 1st. where it took two to three days for the hackers to recover.

 There are two sizes: 11-inch or 12.9-inch, with storage ranging from 128GB all the way up to 1TB. Pricing also has a wide range, of $799 for the 11-inch 1218GB model, up to $1,499 for the 1TB 12.9-inch model. Add cellular connectivity to either model for $150 more. The Pro uses Apple's A12Z processor, making it the most powerful iPad currently available.
 The Pro also supports the second-generation Apple Pencil, with a magnetic spot on the side to charge it. The Smart Connector is on the back of the iPad Pro, giving you the option to use it with the recently launched Magic Keyboard that includes backlit keys and trackpad, or Apple's Smart Keyboard.

If you're taking advantage of this time in which people are spending more time at home perusing the internet (you should) and you've decided that you want to ramp up your content (I hope so), great. I'd like to offer a suggestion— now is a great time to pursue livestreaming for your business.
 Under ordinary circumstances I would recommend sticking with the content medium that suits you best. It’s easier to be consistent with the type that you prefer. Right now, it's a different ball game, the situation has changed. If you’re a business owner who loves to write and for years you’ve been writing blog content and creating articles and publishing them all over the place, great. I strongly encourage you to add livestreaming to your marketing activities.
 The first reason to dive into livestreaming right now is differentiation. In a sea of competing products and services and online scams, standing out is beneficial. When consumers see you sharing expertise that’s useful to them, they’ll resonate with it because they know that you're the real deal. Going live allows you to build awareness, establish credibility, foster trust and it creates legitimacy around your business. If your competitors aren’t doing something and you believe that your audience will prefer it, try it.
 If you’ve noticed that your engagement on social media has decreased, livestreaming is a method to bring it back. Eighty-two percent of social users prefer to watch a live video than read a social post, and 45% of livestream viewers are willing to pay for exclusive video content. Videos are ruling the internet right now and your livestream allows you to “double-dip” in the algorithm by attracting viewers during your broadcast and on the replay.

We’ve all done things we wish we could take back and start over. It’s harder for some than others – especially if that mistake involves a criminal conviction. But some people with a criminal past can wipe the slate clean if enough time has passed. Melange Health Solutions held a seminar on Tuesday to teach locals how to expunge their records in hopes of increasing their chances at employment.
 Willie Moore was 27 when he was convicted of larceny and breaking and entering. He paid a big price. There was prison time – two years. And he says he's still paying the price for it since he was released more than 25 years ago.
 "I have turned in resumes and stuff of that nature but when it comes to the question of 'Have you been convicted?' I want to be honest when it comes to answering that question so when I answer that question truthfully, then it's like 'uhhh …' I don't hear nothing else from 'em no more."
 He’s been able to land a few jobs, but is currently unemployed. Moore would like that to change.  That’s why he attended a seminar Tuesday to learn how he can clear his criminal record. The seminar attracted about 200 residents of the Charlotte Housing Authority.
 They had lots of questions for Legal Aid's Cindy Patton, the keynote speaker at the expungement seminar.
 Andrea Symes is the community outreach coordinator for Melange Health Solutions. It's a group that focuses on behavioral and mental health, but she says there was great demand from clients who wanted to learn more about expungement. That's because for some, a criminal record was frequently barring them from housing, employment and educational opportunities.
 State laws differ, but in North Carolina, low-level nonviolent felonies or misdemeanors can be expunged after 15 years.
 It’s a process that takes about eight months to complete, and can cost roughly $200. Moore left the seminar feeling optimistic.
 "I made a mistake and I feel though now I have learned and I have paid my debt to society and I feel that now I would at least like the opportunity, a chance to give back to society," Moore says.
 Not everyone there left so hopeful.
 Fernella White served a 30-day sentence more than 15 years ago, when she was a teenager. White was convicted of a misdemeanor assault charge in an incident that involved a weapon.
 Even though it was a misdemeanor conviction, she can’t get her record expunged because it’s classified as a violent crime.
 "I kind of understand why I haven't been able to have it expunged, because it's an assault charge," White says. "But [it's been] 15 years, that's not who I am, so I don't understand why I'm not able to have another chance with something that happened so many years ago."
 White is 33 and works at Bojangles. She wants to have an opportunity to give her family a better future.
 "You know with mouths to feed, children, a stupid mistake that was made years before even thinking about having children and now they have to suffer because of one dumb mistake that I made," White says.
 White says she’s thought about pursuing more education and becoming a nurse. But she figures it would be a waste of time. No one would give her a chance.
 If that’s true, there are a lot of people like her. The North Carolina Justice Center estimates North Carolina has more than 1.6 million residents who have a criminal record.

 Let’s say I am selling that plate of food for $10 and I am only making $2 once I sell it, I am not going to have enough money to pay for other expenses like rent, utilities, insurance, labor, banking fees, etc.
 Are you tying up money in inventory that could have been used somewhere else to generate more revenue? With everything we sell, one needs to understand what it costs and how much profit there is when it sells.
 Will you have enough left over to pay the other bills? Sounds easy, doesn’t it? Do you know what your break-even point is? How much do you need to sell just to break even each day?
 Do you know what your daily fixed costs are? Do you understand and know you daily variable costs? Are the margins on what you sell able to cover these fixed and variable expenses?
 A good net profit comes from managing operating costs while understanding profit margins on whatever you are selling.

_"Recently, a South Dakota doctor wrote me, thanking me 'for treating your fellow citizens of South Dakota like adults...' I tell you this because there are also some South Dakota medical professionals who have written to tell me of their fears about voicing their thoughts on the situation."_
 That's positively Trumpian!
 Many people suggest masks may not work! Masks are about personal freedom, not public health! Some doctor thanked Noem for taking such a laissez-faire stance on masks!
 Come on, people. Wise up. Or, at a minimum, check out this Washington Post chart correlating states where mask wearing is prevalent (and not) with people who say they known someone with Covid-19 symptoms.
 Masks work to drastically slow the spread of the virus. They remain -- until a vaccine is widely available -- our best tool to fight Covid-19. This is not a political or a partisan statement. It is a fact.
 Why is Noem refusing to acknowledge the facts about the virus -- even as it ravages her state? Because she has her eye on a bigger prize, a potential spot on the national ticket in four years. Noem has openly courted Trump -- she commissioned a miniature Mount Rushmore with his face carved on it! -- and his supporters assiduously since being elected the first woman governor of South Dakota in 2018.
 According to South Dakota TV station KOTA, Noem will have traveled to North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, Georgia, Missouri, Oregon, Minnesota, Florida and New Hampshire as a surrogate for Trump during this campaign.
 Aligning herself so closely with Trump in her response to Covid-19 could well be a smart strategic move for Noem as the party turns in 2024 to its future national candidates. But for the residents of her state, Noem's actions in regard to the virus have been downright deplorable.

The latest report from the Vermont Department of Labor shows that while jobs slowly return the labor force continues to contract suggesting there is a long way to go for the economy to recover.
 The headline data point is that unemployment rate in September fell statewide to 4.2% from August’s 4.8% but this shrouds the true nature of the state’s economic condition. State officials say the shrinking labor force and the number of people still seeking unemployment benefits as a result of the pandemic paint a truer picture of the slow economic recovery from the depths of the employment crisis when the majority of the economy was shutdown in late March and April due to the pandemic.
 “While the data shows that employment increased in September, we know there are still many Vermonters out of work and businesses unable to operate at full capacity as a result of the Pandemic,” said Vermont Labor Commissioner Michael Harrington. “And yet, we see more and more jobs come back online each and every day, showing the resiliency of Vermont’s business community. Unfortunately, our businesses can only reopen if they can find people to fill their vacant positions.”

 CATALUÑA Y LA RIOJA, LAS ÚLTIMAS EN SUMARSE
 Además, durante esta tarde, el Govern de la Generalitat de Cataluña se ha reunido de manera urgente para decidir pedirle al Ejecutivo central la declaración del estado de alarma. Como ha sucedido con otros gobiernos autonómicos, en Cataluña también reclaman la gestión de ese estado de alarma.
 La siguiente en solicitarlo ha sido la presidenta de La Rioja, la socialista Concha Andreu, que insta además a que se decrete en todo el territorio nacional y el mando y la gestión pertenezcan a las autonomías, tal y como ha planteado Urkullu.
 Por el momento, ninguna autonomía gobernada por el Partido Popular ha solicitado esta norma jurídica que ha estado rigiendo durante quince días en nueve municipios de la Comunidad de Madrid después de que así lo aprobara el Consejo de Ministros. Desde 'Génova' han planteado en varias ocasiones al Gobierno un 'plan b' jurídico como alternativa a este decreto de alarma.
 EL GOBIERNO, A LA ESPERA
 Esta batería de solicitudes que han realizado las Comunidades Autónomas no ha encontrado por el momento respuesta oficial en el Gobierno central. El presidente del Ejecutivo, Pedro Sánchez, ha comparecido esta mañana para alertar de la "gravedad" de la situación, pero no ha hecho referencia a ninguna otra medida.
 Eso sí, según informan fuentes de La Moncloa a Europa Press, el Ejecutivo ha decidido dar "algo tiempo" a las comunidades para ver cuántas deciden sumarse finalmente a la iniciativa anunciada ya por seis autonomías.
 Es el Consejo de Ministros el que, según la Constitución, debe aprobar la declaración del estado de alarma. El Gobierno no necesita el visto bueno del Congreso para aprobar este instrumento, salvo que tenga que pedir una prórroga para aplicarlo más allá de los 15 días iniciales.
 El presidente del Gobierno, Pedro Sánchez, viaja este viernes a Roma para asistir este sábado a su audiencia con el Papa Francisco I en el Vaticano. No obstante, ya hace dos semanas delegó en su vicepresidenta primera, Carmen Calvo, la declaración del estado de alarma "territorializado" para restringir la movilidad en la Comunidad de Madrid, que se aprobó en un Consejo de Ministros extraordinario.
