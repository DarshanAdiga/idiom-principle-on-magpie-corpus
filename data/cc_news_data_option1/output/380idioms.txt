Ironically, Lutheran High’s 48-47 lead at game’s end was the only time the Eagles had the lead during the overtime and was the result of the Warriors’ final play of the game going awry which put Koss on the line for the game winner.
 Crofton coach John Connot’s timeout with 36 seconds remaining resulted in an unsuccessful drive to the basket by Andy Knapp, whose teammates failed to clear their defenders to the other side of the floor in time, leaving a crowded lane for Knapp to attempt to navigate. During a scramble for the rebound after the missed shot, Koss was fouled and sent to the free throw line with time returned on the clock.
 “I told the guys after the game that it’s one of those things that came down to a last second call by the official with .8 left, which is tough, but it came down to free throws and it shouldn’t have come down to that,” Connot said. “We were 12 of 27 from the line; if you make free throws it doesn’t come down to a last second call and probably doesn’t even go into overtime.”

It was one decade ago this month that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that corporations were “people” endowed with the right of free speech. To deny a corporation or union the opportunity to weigh in with political campaigning and messaging was to deny their constitutional right, the court said.
 Ten years later, the volume from corporations, unions and a small group of super rich people has reverberated through American politics.
 Most troubling is the erosion of rules guarding transparency in political donations.
 Anonymous groups and individuals reported nearly $1 billion in direct spending to the Federal Elections Commission in the past decade — 10 times the amount in the decade before.
 Additionally, in the past 10 years, we’ve seen the rise of so-called independent groups that are (allegedly) not linked to any candidate. In the 20 years prior to Citizens United, those groups had spent $750 million in the name of candidates. In the past decade, that spending jumped to $4.5 billion.
 Where transparency does exist, it shows outsized influence by some of the richest Americans. Public records over the past 10 years show that almost half of all donations to PACs from individuals can be attributed to 25 wealthy donors. The top five of those donors represented a quarter of total donations.
 This isn’t a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. Both sides have been flooded with donations from billionaires such as George Soros, Tom Steyer, Ken Griffin, Mike Bloomberg and Charles and the late David Koch.
 The battle between campaign finance accountability and the First Amendment to finance public speech is decades old. There are important values on each side of the equation. We respect that citizens should have the right to express political opinions — and are willing to put their money where their mouth is. But we also feel that it is reasonable for voters to know who is funding the messages.
 The Supreme Court’s ruling in Citizens United was supposed to come in tandem with unprecedented transparency. Only that didn’t happen.
 It’s hard enough to sort out the truth amid all the mudslinging in a political campaign, particularly when no one knows who is behind the advertising or what their motives might be.
 The right of Americans to fund free speech in politics, either individually or collectively, should be respected and protected, but voters should be able to know who is putting up the money — by name and amount.

Superintendent of Schools Daniel Curry stepped to the podium at the Board of Education on Thursday night and delivered his superintendent’s presentation of the proposed operating budget for the 2021 fiscal year.
 The budget is $3,649,249 more than the 2020 adopted fiscal year budget.
 The board of education will take public comments on the budget through March 20, when it will be brought before the county commissioners.
 “Well, it’s a starting point and there’s been years where it doesn’t really get modified much from this point,” said Curry, who sported a red and yellow emoji bowtie. “I don’t know what to predict [for the final budget] because if you stick with your revenue estimates as you have them, and then it’ll be up to the board.”
 The biggest increase in the budget from last year is regular education salaries and wages, which will receive an extra $3,713,492.
 “We are negotiating a contract and when you are negotiating there are some unknowns and that salary line item is a concern [because it says nothing about restorative steps],” said Calvert Education Association President Dona Ostenso, who noted that two restorative steps were included in the previous 4-year contract, which is set to expire June 30. “And I think that’s important. I thought that was a great direction that we were moving to make up those steps. I want it not to be forgotten that there are two restorative steps hanging out there.”
 “I am currently being paid on a 27-step scale, two years below my teacher experience,” said educator Lynda Hampshire, who has been teaching for more than 29 years. “I see that Dr. Curry’s budget had a three million increase in salary and wages and I also know that one of the missions here for the county is to retain teachers. And if our mission is to truly retain teachers then I’m hoping that this [budget] increase includes restorative steps.
 Among other budget categories, fixed charges gets a boost of $1,512,088 and other instructional costs ($831,066), student transportation ($717,281) and administration ($321,967) also receive significant increases.
 The biggest decrease from the previous year is $473,156 from textbooks & instructional supplies.
 “Board members may want to spend more on this or that and they may also have difficulty in saying, ‘What should we cut?’ or where can we make that money available,” Curry said. “And that’s the hard part of course because everyone would like to have the funds for everything, and everything can’t be a priority every year.”
 “We had to really cut some of the requests from our department of instruction along the lines of staff development and textbooks from last year in order to make some of these things happen,” he added, “[and because of that] it may delay some of initiatives that some of our departments had hoped to be able to afford this year.”
 There was also an increase of $3,649,249 in unrestricted revenues and expenditures.
 “My first thought was that we would get a lot more information,” Ostenso said following the 57-minute meeting. “Based on the last two budget meetings I thought the elected school board wanted more information at the initial meeting. The only thing I heard last night was where the 23 additional positions were going so that is a piece of information, but other than that, the line items don’t really address anything.”
 Curry’s budget would also call for the addition of 23 new positions.”
 “That’s a positive step,” Ostenso said. “I think the [addition of] six middle school teachers in order to allow two middle schools to have a block schedule like Mill Creek Middle School will be a good thing because Mill Creek has been very, very happy with that set-up for the last couple of years. The new positions are a step in the right direction but we need more.”
 But Ostenso added she would have also, liked to have seen more elementary school teachers.
 “I think the thing for me that was missing in those additional staff positions was no increase in elementary education teachers,” said Ostenso, who said she hopes that will be added before the final budget. “It does concern me because I know that I personally have talked about reducing class size in the K-2 range and other teachers and [board members] Inez Claggett and Dawn Balinski have also talked about reducing. We have kindergartens with almost 30 kids. That’s too many.”
 “Overall we wanted to make it clear that the social and emotional issues that have been brought to our attention we will aim to have salaries for in hopes to address them,” Curry said. “But that has a big cost because when you add 20 people, that’s like adding two million dollars.” Curry also noted the budget included four school psychologist interns, who he hopes to recruit to stay and work in Calvert County after completing their on-the-job experiences.
 “I think the interns is a really good step in the right direction,” Ostenso said. “I know Dr. Curry referenced it, but I hope we can get people because contracting is not the way to go, but again it’s the right step adding the positions into the budget.”
 There are also plans to add one guidance counselor each at Northern and Huntingtown high schools.
 “I think two guidance counselors for [those schools] is another positive step because their case loads are really high,” Ostenso said, “but I would have liked to have seen a couple more counselors because we have two elementary schools (Sunderland and Windy Hill) with almost a 700-to-1 ratio.”
 “Please consider funding for remedial instruction and support classes in critical reading and writing for high school students,” public speaker Nancy Crosby, a teacher for 19 years, asked Curry. “If we want to get students into those upper levels they need the skills and the tools to be able to do that. This will also help students accountable for their own learning.”
 Regarding her overall thoughts on the budget, and her wish list, Ostenso said, “my feeling is that if you don’t ask for it, you can never get an opportunity to get it.”
 Six other speakers took to the podium during public comments, most of them continuing to make a case for school safety.
 “You have decided to become committed to making our public schools safer, more respectful places for all of us who walk through its doors every day,” said Beth Roe, who has been an elementary school teacher for 28 years. “Be sure to let us know educators and community members alike what we can do to join the crusade because you have a cavalry who is ready to reform this system, and, not to get political but to make it great again because it is not great anymore.”
 Substitute teacher Sonja DeGuzman shared what a week in the life of a substitute teacher was like as she recalled one girl who blatantly cheated off fellow students, one boy who choked another and a third student who aspired to be a career criminal.
 “My husband asked me ‘Why do you get up and do this job every day?’” DeGuzman said, “[and the answer is] because for every one kid in the class who is being disruptive there’s 10 good ones who want to learn.”
 Recent Patuxent High School graduate Chad Leo, who also spoke at the board’s Jan. 9 meeting, said educators need to be supported.
 “Teachers are fed up between the constant belittlement from the administrators, never ending curriculum changes and support from classroom management,” he said. “I wouldn’t be surprised if our county is teacher-less within the next few years. Without our educators we literally do not have a system.”
 The board of education will accept public comments on the proposed 2021 operating budget through Friday, March 20.

Mostert may have assumed control in the 49ers' backfield, but it's still the guys in front of him (as well as Kyle Shanahan's play-calling) who make their running attack so potent. For the year, the 49ers averaged 154.2 yards per game on the ground, second-best in the league. But the Chiefs must now contend with a running attack that just pasted 285 yards on the Packers last week and has run the ball for 471 yards, including a jarring 290 yards after contact, in two postseason games. Kansas City's run defense was 26th-ranked in the NFL but has improved in recent weeks -- the Chiefs stunned the Titans by holding star Derrick Henry to 69 rushing yards after he had three straight games of more than 180 rushing yards. But San Francisco's zone-blocking attack is as lethal as it is relentless as the 49ers ran the ball 82 percent and 69 percent of the time during their two playoff wins. The only way the 49ers deviate from what works offensively is if the Chiefs can somehow slow them down.

Scrape and strip away all of that, and there Kobe Bryant was, the Black Mamba I saw play in person on more than a few occasions: a six-foot-six specimen of a humanoid who came into the NBA as a teenager, tall and lanky and wide-eyed, and left it muscled and statesman-like, having willed his frame from every manner of finger and hand and shoulders injuries, including his miraculous return from that torn Achilles. He had the encyclopedic IQ of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, the Cirque du Soleil flexibility of Michael Jordan and Dr. J, and the insatiable appetite to win of Bill Russell and Jerry West. Watching Kobe Bryant play basketball was like watching The Nicholas Brothers tap and contort and leap through the most brilliant dance routine in film history in “Stormy Weather,” defying gravity and common sense in spite of the many ways Black men had been told to stay in their place.

The reality is that California’s economy needs more well-trained and well- educated workers, but obtaining a four-year college degree these days is very difficult given the inability of the state’s public universities to handle the demand.
 That’s especially true for low-income students from the state’s less-populated regions because they must also cope with high living costs as they are forced to leave home to attend college.
 Community colleges, which offer close-to-home, low-cost educations, do provide lower-division courses, but students still must transfer to four-year universities to complete their degrees.
 Other states, facing the same dilemma, have responded by broadly authorizing community colleges to offer baccalaureate programs and California’s pilot program has been an effort to replicate that rational approach.
 However, political reality has made that expansion difficult. The state university system guards its place in the academic pecking order jealously and as a result, the pilot program was very limited, allowing the community colleges to offer degrees just in a few relatively obscure subjects that the universities ignored.
 Ironically, the state universities’ resistance to what it regarded as competition for money and students mirrors the resistance that the University of California displayed when the state universities wanted to begin offering some doctorate programs.
 The LAO report ignored these three-way turf struggles, which have bubbled up for decades, in its lukewarm report on the community college pilot program.“We found little evidence that graduates from these pilot programs were better prepared to fill these positions compared to those with other bachelor’s degrees or that pilot program graduates were helping employers fill hard-to- staff positions,” the LAO said. “The most common benefit of the pilot cited by students was the relatively low cost of attending the community college bachelor’s degree programs.”

Cheech and Chong may have wasted their ill-spent youth “Up in Smoke.” But they didn’t have a clue about the kind of edible marijuana treats that would flood the marketplace in their old age. In the 1960s, there were only homemade hash brownies, thanks to “The Alice B. Toklas Cookbook” with the recipe for Hashish Fudge. These days there are marijuana-infused cookies, gummies, hard candies, pizza, chips, trail mix, ice cream, sodas, coffees, teas, energy drinks and condiments.
 As lighthearted as that all sounds, docs writing in the Canadian Medical Association Journal are sounding the alarm, since folks are not aware that ingested pot can take up to four hours to make its effects felt — so you eat and eat, trying to get a buzz, and end up overdosing.

With less than a week before the Iowa caucuses, it's not surprising to hear people calling for an end to the Iowa caucuses. Or at least for an end to the privileged place the state occupies in the nomination calendar.
 This isn't unusual. Critics of Iowa's leadoff role have been around for nearly as long as the modern caucuses themselves.
 In some ways, we understand the arguments. Iowa is much older and whiter than the rest of the country. And, let's face it, the state has no inherent right to its spot in the calendar.
 Iowa has benefited by its partnership with New Hampshire to guard their spots, as well as the inability of other states to come to an agreement on an alternative.

In the near future, the stored electricity PHEVs segment is expected to outshine the other segment, providing for a demand share of more than three-fourth. On the basis of powertrain, the market has been bifurcated into parallel hybrid, series hybrid, and combined hybrid plug-in electric vehicles. The former is currently the most sought-after category while series hybrid accounts for only one- fourth of the total demand. Based on vehicle type, the market gains significantly more demand for passenger cars than other segments, viz. commercial vehicles, two wheelers, and others including gold carts.

IOWA CITY — Joe Toussaint couldn’t sleep Sunday.
 Hours after hearing about the tragic death of basketball legend Kobe Bryant, Toussaint went to the gym to work through his grief.
 “I just came back here and just put up a lot of shots,” the freshman guard said following Iowa’s 68-26 win over Wisconsin on Monday night at Carver- Hawkeye Arena. “I was getting tired and I just kept shooting. It was sad to hear about that news. He’s a big reason I do what I do, why a lot of people do what they do.”
 Toussaint said he came to the gym around 9 or 10 p.m. and shot until about 10:45 p.m. He scored 11 points in Monday’s game, including the go-ahead free throw with 1 minute and 20 seconds left as the Hawkeyes rallied out of a 12-point deficit.
 “I have a lot of favorite players in the NBA and Kobe was definitely one of them,” Toussaint said. “Just the way he carried himself, the things he’d do, being passionate. He inspired a lot of people and I’m one that he inspired.”
 The death of Bryant, a five-time NBA champion and a lock for the Hall of Fame, shook the basketball world Sunday. As news spread that Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna, and seven others died in a helicopter crash that morning in Calabasas, Calif., the Hawkeyes were at a team lunch following practice.
 “You could just feel the emotions from our team,” said sophomore guard Joe Weiskamp. “He was just such an inspiration to young players, young hoopers. People grow up wanting to be like him.”
 The players decided to wear their Nike brand Kobe shoes in honor of Bryant. Some wrote Bryant’s jersey numbers, 8 and 24. Others wrote messages.
 “He just had a tremendous impact on everybody, especially basketball players,” said redshirt freshman CJ Fredrick. “I grew up watching him and LeBron (James), those were my two idols. It was just a big tragedy. We’re praying for their whole family and everybody.”
 Connor McCaffery was the player who suggested wearing Bryant’s signature shoes if possible. Iowa coach Fran McCaffery joined the players in wearing Kobes.
 The elder McCaffery is a Philadelphia native, having played for the same AAU coach as Bryant, Sam Rines. He knew Kobe’s father, Joe Bryant, and his uncle, Chubby Cox.
 Then an assistant coach at Notre Dame, Fran McCaffery tried recruiting Bryant out of Lower Merion High School in suburban Philadelphia.
 Fran McCaffery persuaded his head coach to take a trip to Philadelphia to watch Bryant, who played against future NBA star Richard Hamilton at the Palestra.
 “One of the best high school games I ever saw,” Fran McCaffery said.
 Fran McCaffery wasn’t successful in recruiting Bryant, who opted to go to the NBA directly out of high school.
 Until the night before he tragically died, Bryant was the NBA’s third all-time leading scorer. An 18-time all-star and two-time Olympic gold medalist, Kobe was the greatest player of all time for a large generation of players — much like Michael Jordan is to some and LeBron James is to others.
 “Thoughts and prayers go out for his family,” Fran McCaffery said. “Knowing the impact that he made, I think in particular on the generation that is our (players) right now — like us older guys (idolized) Michael. For me, I watched Kobe grow up. I watched him in high school, I watched him when he was a kid. But for these guys, it really hit home for them.”

College of Southern Maryland Academic Planning and Assessment Director Cami Cooley recently won a top national honor for introducing a powerful online tool to engage CSM students and improve their learning and completion.
 Cooley was named the 2019 First Place Champion by Campus Labs for “driving impactful change on campus” after initiating a real-time formative assessment tool in CSM’s classrooms that lets students know if they are learning the right material, while also letting instructors know which students might need additional help. Because this tool is interactive, students are able to immediately experience an assessment of their learning — and notify professors of their teaching – instead of waiting to pass or fail an exam.
 Cooley was one of 25 finalists in the running for the top spots across five categories, that resulted in eight colleges and two individuals receiving first and second place honors in total. Cooley represented the only community college to achieve top honors. The award came as a surprise to her.
 “I was asked to speak on how CSM initiated the feedback tool and share some of our initial results during a conference in July,” she explained. “From there, I was asked to present to another audience of faculty administrators, data analysts and peers. Next, I was notified I had earned first place in the champion category utilizing technology to achieve change a campus — in a national competition that I didn’t even know existed!”
 “Cami’s recognition is well-deserved and we are extraordinarily pleased with her work,” said CSM Vice President of Academic Affairs Eileen Abel. “CSM is always trying to improve our students’ learning experience. We have been working with our professors for some time to make the most out of their course evaluations. Our goal is to help students who don’t understand the material get the help they need very early in the semester to aid in their success.”
 Abel and Cooley shared that CSM professors have been looking for multiple solutions to address several issues, including: improving instruction early-on in the classroom; improving learning; addressing the need for faculty to intervene when learning was not taking place; establishing a method for referring at-risk students to tutors and other guided assistance; and finally initiating a technique to improve summative ratings at the end of the term.
 CSM professors are not alone. In several reports written by Elizabeth Mann Levesque, a nonresident fellow — governance studies with the Brown Center on Education Policy and published by the Brookings Institute last year, “many community college students in the U.S. do not complete a credential or degree,” and “evidence suggests that helping students navigate the college environment and connect their coursework to their lives can help solve the community college completion puzzle.”
 Levesque identified five ways to boost community college completion rates, including early intervention for those students who are struggling. She also suggested creating Guided Pathways so students see the relevance between their coursework and their career and education goals. CSM introduced Guided Pathways this year to also help focus students as they begin their coursework at CSM.
 “Our students want to succeed,” explained CSM President Maureen Murphy. “They work hard but don’t always have the tools they need. Many come to us not knowing where they want to go, or how to get there. So, we developed the simple guided approach of Guided Pathways to help them figure it all out.”
 Guided Pathways is working at other colleges, noted Murphy, thanks to intense advising and coaching services that keeps students on their academic journey.”
 “When CSM’s new feedback tool was introduced, we were all excited to see it,” Cooley concurred. “Now faculty can receive feedback that allows them to adjust their teaching during the course rather than after the fact when it’s too late for current students. This is a promising new tool and it has provided us with enough information to know that it can be used not only as a bridge to student success but also as an effective retention tool so that our learners complete their degrees.”
 “The impact of having our instructors use this tool has been felt by our faculty and our students,” Cooley said. “By using this tool, instructors have a deeper understanding of, and a connection with, each individual student. And, our students have concrete evidence that our CSM instructors care about them and their learning.”
 Cooley’s efforts to improve students’ success also aligns with reforms CSM is currently evaluating as part of Achieving the Dream, a network of more than 220 colleges in 43 states dedicated to improving student success. On May 8, CSM shared that it was one of 16 colleges among the 2019 Cohort announced by ATD.
 As a network institution, CSM is undergoing a three-year process to innovate, implement, align and scale cutting-edge changes along with ATD coaches to build institutional capacity and connect with peers to foster learning and share information.
 “Achieving the Dream is a network of people across the country that will support us as we focus on what it is we need to do to help our students in finding their paths and finish what they started,” said Murphy, at time of the announcement. “This is something that is going to be very powerful for Southern Maryland.”
 Campus Labs announced the winners of the 2019 Campus Labs Awards Nov. 4.
 After wrapping up its third season this year, the annual competition celebrates exemplary member campuses and individuals for excelling and innovating in their respective fields in higher education.
 “The 2019 awards season saw 25 finalists vie for the top spots across the Rising Star, Trailblazer, Collaborator, All Star and Champion categories, with eight campuses and two individuals receiving first and second place honors in total,” according to the company’s press release. “Award winners are chosen from both campus-submitted and company-nominated applications, shining the spotlight on everything from successful tool adoption and cross-campus collaboration to sustained success and innovation with Campus Labs tools. In recognition of their achievements, winners were awarded more than $10,000 in educational grants and prizes in total.”

"It's just me now - with my wife filling in while I have a break. I used to open at 7am, but now I'm not bothering until 10am because there is no-one around. And I stay open until 2am, just in the hope of picking up some late night trade.
 "I've thought of packing in and selling the business. But I don't think I'll find a buyer with the way things are right now. It's definitely going to shut me down if it goes on until August."
 Established jeweller David Jones, who has been in business for 35 years, has been in contact with the developers and the university and is hoping to have a meeting with them in the next few days.
 "I agree that improvements in the city centre, like University Square, are a fantastic thing for Preston. But it could be at the expense of businesses along Friargate. They have to consider us, the businesses, who are having a tough time right now."
 As a barber, Nitesh Maru depends on passing trade at The Original Barbershop in Friargate. But the dramatic drop in footfall has had a marked effect on his business.
 "We were told nine months and that is a long time to put up with this," he said. "Some traders along here are wondering if they are going to last until the street re-opens. Some don't think they will."
 At phone shop Fone Box, Adil Patel admitted things had been "very quiet" since the road closed.
 "It's a lot quieter than it normally is. I've really noticed a drop in trade. There aren't the same number of people walking past, so we aren't seeing the same number of people calling in."
 Florist Margaret Mason, Preston's longest serving retailer, refuses to be downcast even though she looks out onto "road closed" signs and her famous eye-catching window displays are being viewed by thousands fewer passers-by.
 "We're still doing them," said Margaret who has been in business in Friargate for 58 years. "We used to get plenty of people passing here on buses and on foot and looking at our windows. But not at the moment.
 "But my view is we can't do anything about the roadworks. They're here for a while now. All we can do is get on with it and tell people 'Friargate is open for business - not shut.'
 "The road closure has affected a lot of businesses down here and some a lot worse than mine. But we just have to work around it the best we can.
 "My message to the people of Preston is: 'Please come to Friargate. Please support the businesses. It would be tragic if some shopkeepers closed down because of this.
 "At the moment it's business as usual. The road might be blocked to traffic, but the footpaths are still open. So pay us a call."
 CALL FOR SHOPS TO BE COMPENSATED
 Leaders of Preston's Business Improvement District (BID) are calling for retailers affected by the roadworks to be compensated for their losses.
 The group, which represents more than 800 businesses in the city centre, has urged shop owners to apply to the council for a reduction in their rates.
 "Unfortunately this is a problem that will have an affect on many shops and businesses in close proximity to the Adelphi works," said Mark Whittle from BID.
 "Many businesses are reporting a significant downturn in trade as a result of a loss in footfall, and its damaging.
 "In the past there has been little that a business can access in the way of compensation when works damage their profitability. However, local authorities do have the power to provide relief on business rates based on hardship.
 "We would urge the businesses affected to contact the council and apply for support whilst the works are underway.
 "We appreciate that the construction project is necessary and when complete will transform that part of the city centre for the better. Yet we need to be mindful that the livelihood of many local people is dependent on those businesses keeping afloat.
 "These businesses, which have been affected by no fault of their own, should be supported and compensated accordingly."
 UCLAN SAYS SORRY
 University bosses have apologised to traders for the impact the roadworks are having on trade.
 But a UCLan spokesman urged shopkeepers to be patient, saying the improvements would be "worth it in the end."
 "We are sorry for any disruption being caused to businesses and the public while we improve the Friargate area of Preston," said Michael Ahern, the university's chief information and infrastructure officer.
 "Throughout the process of making our vision for the masterplan a reality, we have gone to great lengths to minimise the affects of our building work, including visits to discuss plans, the provision of additional car parking, information about diversions and a drop-in centre.
 "We have also worked very hard to ensure that pedestrian access to all businesses on Friargate and the surrounding areas remains fully open.
 "We continue to work closely with a wide range of stakeholders to ensure our plans are communicated regularly and have the interests of students, staff and the public at heart.
 "The current phase of highways work is on schedule to be completed during July and we would ask local businesses and indeed all our stakeholders for their continued patience.
 "Once the short-term disruption of trade is passed, local traders will benefit from our investment through a much more vibrant trading environment surrounded by the highest quality streetscape incorporating spaces for a range of community, business and student uses.
 "Please bear with us, it will be worth it in the end."

My advice to Dan Misko about his take on handing his personal cup to a kid at a coffee shop all along knowing he has the flu, is to stay home. You already gave him the flu without touching him. Stay home and make yourself a cup of tea in your already used cup. While you are at it, use a cup that doesn’t end up in the landfill. It probably doesn’t take a democrat to remind you that the landfill is filling up with one use paper cups by those republicans that don’t recycle because it is another crazy democratic idea that forces people to think before they toss.

On the basis of the region, the cheese market has been segmental into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa, and Latin America. Europe, on account to the maximum usage of cheese, holds the highest share of the market. Cheese is an important part of the European diet, and it forms an integral component of most European delicacy dishes. Half of the consumer in Europe depends on cheese for their protein intake, and cheese is still the favorite travel food for European travelers.
