A statement was released on Thursday which read: “The FA and Leagues at Steps 3 to 6 have reached a consensus that the 2019/20 season for Steps 3 to 6 will be ended with immediate effect and all results will be expunged.
 “This will mean that there will be no promotion or relegation of Clubs between Steps 3 to 6, or relegation from Step 2.
 “In light of the above, these decisions will also apply to the Leagues and Clubs at Step 7 of the National League System.
 “The FA will continue to assist and support the National League (Steps 1 and 2 of the NLS) to determine the outcome of the 2019/20 season.
 “Consideration was given as to whether the season could be extended indefinitely, or to some later date in the future in order for it to be completed. However, given the current uncertainty regarding when it will be possible to resume competitive football in England, and the fact that many clubs and contracted players want certainty over when football will resume, this option is likely to present great difficulties for football between Steps 3 to 6.

When it is finally safe to celebrate what was scheduled as the 2020 Salute to Excellence in Healthcare with our community, it would be proper to dedicate the event in memory of Judy Wilson-Griffin. An African-American nurse at SSM Health St. Mary’s Hospital, she was the first person in the St. Louis metropolitan area to succumb to the COVID-19 pandemic. Of course, it is in the interest of social distancing to slow and ultimately halt the spread of the novel coronavirus that we postponed this year’s health salute, as countless community events are being canceled.
 We mourn this healthcare worker and pray for the healing of her family. While other news media reported Judy's name before we did (she was not named in the initial public announcement of the region's first official death from COVID-19), we believe we may have been the first to post her photograph. We make this point not as some gruesome point-keeping about journalistic firsts regarding the tragic loss of a human life, but rather to discuss the way the community is responding to this crisis. The fact of Judy's death before we knew her name or shared her photograph was passed over in relative silence by the readers of our website. Once her photograph was included, everyone could see that the crisis' first victim was an African-American woman - someone who looks like any of us and our friends, sisters, wives, mothers, grandmothers. Only then did the story become something a great many people wanted to share. More than 1 million people have now read her story on stlamerican.com.
 This is very important. Last week in our print edition, we reported a story with arguably more widespread and long-term impact than the region’s first tragic death from the pandemic. We reported the first evidence of community spread of the virus. Community spread means the infection could not be traced to someone traveling to another region or coming into contact with someone else known to be infected, but rather could have come from anyone or anywhere in the local community. It’s community spread that makes a pandemic, and from the first evidence of community spread we should know that we are in for the fight of our lives that had been predicted.
 Our community spread story pointed out that the local man coping with the disease who received it from some unknown local source is African-American. We knew his name and had a photograph of him and his wife because they had provided them to us as a trusted media source. We had every right and permission to publish their names and photograph. However, before we did so we had a conversation with them pointing out that using their names and photograph would have tremendous personal impact. It would credit them for righteously pushing for a better public response to the pandemic. However, they should also expect responses that would be potentially damaging to their family – including ostracism from neighbors and broadcast news teams camped at their doorstep. They decided to withdraw permission to use their names and photograph.

The Lewa Safari Marathon planned for June 27 at the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy has been called off for the first time in 20 years.
 The Chief Executive Officer of Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, Mike Watson, on Thursday disclosed that the race organisers have been forced to cancel this year’s competition to help curb the spread of coronavirus pandemic.
 The title sponsors of this year’s competition were Huawei Kenya and Safaricom PLC.
 “Despite our great willingness to push on, having weighed all factors, we have come to the very difficult decision to cancel this year’s race,” Watson said in a statement, noting that on March 25, the Kenyan government announced 28 cases of Covid-19 in the country and banned all international flights effective from March 25. Also banned are public gatherings and sporting events.
 “A significant number of the marathoners, whose contributions are key to the success of the event, are overseas runners from the UK and the USA. In light of the new travel restrictions and severity of the situation, they will be unable to participate,” said Watson, adding that the government has also issued a public declaration advising Kenyans to avoid all non-essential public gatherings.
 “While we are sure all efforts are being made by the Kenyan government to contain the spread of the virus, it is paramount that we heed the presidential directive to avoid all non-essential public gatherings and play our part in flattening the curve until all of this is behind us,” Watson added.

Technically, Watson was hit three times. Mai Lee, an R&B artist with a national presence that Watson has worked closely with over the years, was ready to release her album.

 “It’s a ghost town right now, and people are scrambling trying to figure out what to do, and where are they are going to get income from. And is there a business after this is over?”
 He’s filled with uncertainty about what the economy will look like when the smoke from coronavirus clears and feels that Donald Trump is to blame.
 “His approach is so terrible,” Watson said. “We were late to the dance, that’s why we are in the predicament we are in now. And this fool is talking about having [expletive] open by Easter. That’s two weeks from now. Just the thought of him saying that [expletive] me off. It’s something wrong with that man.”
 All of this is happening as Watson faces his greatest health crisis. A cancer survivor who enjoyed years of remission, the disease came back with a vengeance in November. He had surgery that removed all the bone from his leg and his knee, which was replaced with metal. He had a staph infection at his point of surgery, had to be re-hospitalized and is currently unable to walk.
 “I’m trying to balance all of that while this is going on,” Watson said. “It’s equally difficult to process all of this.”
 His own health challenges are part of the reason he’s more concerned with the countless individuals whose health are at risk because of coronavirus than his business suffering because of social distancing. He considers the extreme measures that have cost him his business in the short term to be necessary.
 “I just don’t know how long it’s going to last,” Watson said. “I don’t want to see any of us going through this – but we’re here now.”
 He is nervous, but hopeful for how the outcome of the economy will impact his business.
 “As black folks in this country we have been through storms for centuries,” Watson said. “I’ve been broke, I’ve had money and been broke again. I’ve been sick and I’ve been healthy and sick again.”
 He feels that staying vigilant and getting creative as the financial aftershock of coronavirus hits is essential.
 “As for right now, I’m just praying,” Watson said. “At this point it’s all we can do – that and stay in the damn house.”

The sudden stop came just as The Black Rep had settled into its reemergence.
 “We spent the past few seasons really swimming upstream and turning things around,” Himes said. “We had rebounded. Last season was just incredible – and this season was getting ready to surpass last season’s numbers.”
 Box office revenue and revenue from education programs were up. Funding had been restored through several sources that they had reestablished relationships with.
 “Marie and Rosetta,” a gospel musical play about the legacy of Sister Rosetta Tharpe as the season finale was set to follow well-received productions of “Don’t Bother Me, I Can’t Cope,” August Wilson’s “Two Trains Running” and “Spell #7.” It was set to be a commercial triumph.
 “We expected record-breaking or close to record-breaking numbers in attendance for that show,” Himes said. And it was happening on the heels of “Spell #7.” Rapper Tef Poe and costume director Brandin Vaughn used their strong social media presence to attract a new audience for The Black Rep.
 “I just think that we had really tapped into something rich – and hopefully we will be able to hit that vein again,” Himes said. “We were riding a high tide and it seems like ‘woosh, wipeout,” Himes said. “Total wipeout.”
 Things are up in the air for “Marie and Rosetta,” but Himes’ immediate concern is for the handful of young adults who make up this season’s cohort of professional interns.
 “Over half of our interns came to St. Louis just to work at The Black Rep,” Himes said. “And when people talk about living check to check, that’s pretty much how our interns live. I emailed and asked, ‘Is everybody good in the cupboard? The next time I cook a pot of chili, do I have to double the beans in it and do some drop offs?’”
 Himes said, like thousands of displaced college students, the non-natives are not likely to have the money to get home.
 “I’m concerned for them and about them and I feel responsible for them and to them,” Himes said. “I want to make sure that we are here for them.”
 In the meantime, He urges longtime patrons and theater lovers to stay tuned.
 “We are still here,” Himes said. “We will be back, and we hope that they will be there when we are able to come back.”

“We’ve received several reports from publicans about thefts, break-ins and vandalism in their establishments. Fruit machines and alcohol are obviously the main attractions.
 “Some premises have just been the victims of random vandalism as gangs are roaming the streets thinking they are untouchable at present.”
 The news comes after a pub was broken into days after it asked looters to water the plants when it closed due to the coronavirus outbreak. Owners of The Thornwood bar in Glasgow shut its doors last Monday and said they had “tidied everything away” ahead of a lengthy closure.
 Vandals then broke into the licensed premises in the city’s Dumbarton Road. Nothing was taken but owner Marc Ferries was left with damage to repair. He posted a picture on Instagram and wrote: “If you think I went in to work to tidy up the mess made by the burglars, you’d be spot on.
 “If you think I then made a sculpture out of toilet rolls, put on a mullet wig and watered a plant to poke fun at the wee bams, you would also be right.”

But if you want to retire when you're younger, that percentage will probably need to be more like 40% to 50% of your income.

This is the second time in about two weeks that the river has burst its banks, marooned houses and destroyed the locals’ property.
 Kisumu County Commissioner Susan Waweru who rushed to the scene, said the floods have also affected people in Sango Rota in Nyakach Sub-county.
 “This is posing a challenge to the government since we are trying to ensure that people do not crowd to control the spread of coronavirus pandemic,” she told the Nation.
 She indicated that a multi-agency team comprising officials from both the county and national governments had been formed to guarantee the residents’ safety.
 “Although as we might be forced to evacuate the affected people to higher grounds and in surrounding schools, we will ensure that they do not exceed five people per class as a way of maintaining social distancing,” she added.
 Onjiko-Awasi MCA Maurice Ngeta raised concerns that half the members of his ward were affected and appealed for an urgent solution to save the residents’ lives and property.
 “We don’t want to experience a recurrence of this. We call on the respective arms of government to take the necessary measures to resolve this problem once and for all,” Mr Ngeta said.

Hundreds of commuters were stranded Thursday after heavy rain swept away a section of the Ahero-Kisii highway.
 The problem was caused by poor drainage due to the ongoing construction of a bridge at Ayweyo Centre in Nyando Sub-county, Kisumu County, leading to a traffic jam.
 According to a local resident, Mr Dan Ngage, the stretch from Ahero junction to Katito has only two culverts instead of the recommended 27 water channels.
 The Kenya National Highways Authority urged motorists to use the Ahero-Awasi- Katito, Kericho-Kisii or Kapsoit to Sondu roads to avoid being inconvenienced.
 But a number of passengers who spoke to the Nation said they were not prepared to use the alternative routes because it would cost them more.
 Meanwhile, more than 100 households in the locality have also been displaced by the raging waters of the River Nyalbiego and were evacuated to the nearby St Christopher’s RC Primary School.
