It was windy today folks….reel windy!! I can tell you from personal experience. My buddy Jeff Coats and I jumped in the Fish in OC Carolina Skiff today to try and get another episode of Hooked on OC in the can….and it was tough! The idea was to go flounder fishing for the show, but after drifting behind Assateague Island and the Thorofare and releasing just one fish we decided to switch tactics. The "slur" was so bad in the bay today that it was almost impossible to drift for flounder. We were constantly pulling the gooey, green clumps off of our rigs until we finally got tired of it. We regrouped and headed to the Rout 50 bridge where we found some good catch and release striper action and some "snapper" bluefish that saved the day….and the show. Big Bird's World Famous Roy Rig was the hot ticket and helped us catch enough fish for a new episode.

In any case, with my freedom of speech and freedom of expression, I can raise my voice and speak on the fact that I do not see the Afrikaner humour of a gallows in public space, nor am I going to walk by this landmark and turn a blind eye, which is why we have launched a petition for its removal from Henties Bay.  This petition for the removal of The Gallows "landmark" from the public location in Henties Bay and that the "landmark" be put in a Namibian Museum with an accurate description. That is all.
