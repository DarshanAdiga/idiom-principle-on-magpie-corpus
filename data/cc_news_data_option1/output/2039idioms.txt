Initially worried about the expansion of gambling in Wyoming and the effect it could have on tribal gaming revenues, the Northern Arapaho Tribe resisted efforts to allow the expansion of video gambling. But leaders eventually said they would support the creation of a commission to regulate the machines if they had a seat at the table.
 At a state Legislature Travel, Recreation, Wildlife & Cultural Resources Committee meeting earlier this year, Business Council member Kim Harjo said the creation of a gaming commission could be a “slippery slope,” leading to more widespread gambling across Wyoming.

Most of the vaccine shots in the pipeline aim to train the immune system to recognize the "spike" protein that studs the coronavirus' outer surface, priming the body to react if it ever encountered the real infection. Some candidates are made using just the genetic code for that protein, and others use a harmless virus to deliver the protein-producing information. Still other vaccine candidates are more old-fashioned, made with the killed whole virus.

Telstra was last year approached by the Australian Football League (AFL) to develop a way to track the players and display it in a real-time and interactive way to fans.
 Speaking at Amazon Web Services (AWS) Summit Online, Telstra lead architect Ralph Stone said the proposition was quite simple. It involved the players wearing tags on the back of their jerseys and as they moved around during the game, the tags -- utilising GPS and a location accelerometer -- would measure the instantaneous velocity, log average velocity, and the distance the player travels during the game.
 Every two seconds, sensors around the ground would gather the information as Telstra's data collection partner collates all the data and packages it up so that at the end of the game, coaches and players can analyse the statistics and develop learning strategies from there.
 But the AFL wanted this to occur in real time, not just after the game.
 "The product proposal was fascinating. It was, 'Now that we've got this data, what if we streamed it to our customers who are watching live games during the match?'" he explained.

As has been the case all over the world, COVID-19 has exacerbated profound social inequalities, affecting those for whom spatial distancing is largely impossible. It is not a strange paradox under capitalism that those deemed to be “essential workers” are also those who struggle the most to make ends meet. These underpaid workers are effectively endangered as they are forced in to workplaces where they may encounter the virus. Moreover, they must often contend with difficult sanitary conditions at home, as they typically live in densely populated areas where distancing is inherently challenging.

SNL Kagan forecasts that political spending will reach $2.5 billion in 2010, which would represent around a 25% gain over the midterm elections in 2006. SNL Kagan says Sinclair Broadcast Group has the largest footprint of the local TV pure-plays in the 16 states with the most highly-contested elections, according to the new study, Broadcasting Guide to the 2010 Elections.
 Gray is also well positioned, according to Kagan, with 14 stations in toss-up states like Florida, Kentucky, Nevada and Wisconsin.
 CBS and Univision get the nod as the network station groups with the most viewers in those states. though Fox has the largest footprint of all with 28 stations in 16 states.
 "In 2010, we expect that the combination of political unrest, high-profile congressional and gubernatorial races, and the Jan. 21 Supreme Court ruling that struck down certain laws restricting corporate and labor contributions to campaigns will lead to a political ad revenue treasure trove for broadcasters," noted SNL Kagan Analyst Tony Lenoir.
 In a presentation at the TVB conference in New York last week, Kantar Media's CMAG President Evan Tracey said political spending was up around $160 million from the same point in 2006. "We are in a hypercompetitive place right now in our country's politics," said Tracey. "This is the most competitive environment I've ever seen."
 One possible cloud on that sunny ad horizon is if   the Senate were to approve a bill, the DISCLOSE Act, meant to take   some of the teeth out of that Supreme Court ruling by requiring the major   donors or heads of companies that directly fund campaign ads   to appear in onscreen disclaimers in TV ads.
 The bill, a reaction to the court's decision that   the historic ban on direct corporate or union funding of electioneering   ads (vote for or against this candidate) was an unconstitutional regulation of   political speech, passed the House in June but failed to get a vote in the   Senate. Senate Majority leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) is expected to   schedule another vote on the bill Thursday. It is considered a long shot for   passage, but it only fell two votes short of a cloture vote last time.
 The bill would also require a number of financial   disclosures of donor contributions, ban direct funding by corporations   with government contracts above a certain threshold; and expand the   "electioneering communications" period to which those   restrictions apply from 60 to 120 days before an election, though by now   that last provision would be moot for the current election.
 It also contains a provision that makes it take   effect immediately, rather than having to wait for Federal Election   Commission rules implementing it, so that it could apply to the mid-term   elections.

In light of the attack and the positive rabies test, county officials are encouraging residents to be careful around animals that are behaving unusually.
 Pet owners are urged to make sure their pets rabies vaccination is up-to-date because unvaccinated dogs and cats who have been exposed to an animal that has rabies would have to be quarantined for four months. A dog or cat that has been vaccinated would only have to be quarantined for one month after exposure.
 "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the rabies virus attacks the central nervous system and is almost always fatal in humans if untreated," Gwinnett County animal welfare officials said. "Early symptoms of rabies in people include fever, headache and general weakness or discomfort."
 Anyone who has been bitten or scratched by a stray animal, or an animal that is acting in an unusual way, must get preventive treatment, county officials said. They must seek immediate medical care, letting their doctor know they were exposed. They must then call and speak with an epidemiologist at the Gwinnett County Health Department at 770-339-4260.
 In addition to speaking with health officials, people who have been in contact with an animal suspected of having rabies should call the Gwinnett County Animal Welfare and Enforcement Bite Office at 770-339-3200 ext. 5576. They can call animal welfare/s Dispatch Non-Emergency line at 770-513-5700 after hours as well.

It's one of the most peaceful places in Wilmington, even when planes fly overhead and the faint hum of traffic manages to break through its borders.
   
 Oakdale Cemetery has been a safe haven for the Port City since it opened its gates as a unique and history-making final resting place in 1855.
   
 The cemetery was born out of a necessity for space. In the decade before the Civil War, Wilmington was booming in its population - pushing 10,000 residents and becoming the largest city in the state. But there became an increasing concern that available burial space was sorely lacking.
   
 It's a problem that persists even today, as the population of Wilmington grows but its available land dwindles and its existing burial grounds reach their max.
   
 With new burial options arising over time - cremation and eco-burials have changed the needs of cemeteries and graveyards - there are more options for that final decision.
      
 But in the mid-19th century, traditional coffin burials were the standard and there needed to be space to accommodate them. So a group of people known as the Proprietors for the Wilmington Cemetery acquired a 65-acre tract of land on the east side of Brunt Mill Creek to start a cemetery in 1852.
   
 Then, 15th Street, off which you now access Oakdale, was not part of downtown. So the establishment of Oakdale on the outskirts of Wilmington made it the state's first rural cemetery. The difference between a cemetery and a graveyard is that a graveyard is attached to a church.
   
 Oakdale was designed not just as a burial ground, but also a park of sorts. Plenty of flowers and immaculate iron gates framed the place of reflection and memory with the beauty of a garden. In its first century, cemeteries weren't the stuff of Halloween spectacle and horror movies, but rather considered parks and places of recreation, where residents could come visit their ancestors among the native vegetation of the region.
   
 In time, there would be plenty of notable Wilmington figures and legendary stories to come visit.
   
 Tragically, the first internment was Annie DeRosset, the 3-year-old daughter of the first president of the cemetery, Armand John DeRosset. She was buried on Feb. 5, 1855, with a small lamb atop her lily white grave marker, etched with the phrase "Our Little Annie."
   
 The next year, Nancy Martin, the daughter of a local lumberer, was buried after legend says she died at sea and was placed in a barrel of whiskey or rum to preserve her body for the journey back to Wilmington. Instead of breaking her free when she got home, the barrel was placed in a special grave and sealed shut, marked by a granite cross that reads "Nance."
   
 As the Civil War got underway, the cemetery would not only start to fill out, but it would also become an essential part of the city's handling of its dead.
   
 The Yellow Fever epidemic of 1862 would rattle the city and send thousands of its residents fleeing their homes for refuge far from the coast. Of those that stayed, at least 1,505 would become infected and 654 would die. Most are buried in Oakdale, around 400 of them in a public burial site atop a hill at the center of the cemetery.
   
 Each day, bodies, sometimes in the double digits, would be wheeled to Oakdale and buried in a spot opened for that day or week.
   
 The period between 1862 and 1867 would also become a blind spot for the cemetery's records, after the superintendent, Charles Quigley, fell victim to the yellow fever himself and war hindered records from being properly kept.
   
 The cemetery would, for a time, hold both the Union and Confederate dead of the area, particularly from the Battle of Fort Fisher. But soon after the war, the Confederate soldiers were removed and buried together under a bronze monument erected by the Ladies Memorial Association in 1872. The Union soldiers, once lying in rows next to Yellow Fever Hill, were also removed and transferred to the Wilmington National Cemetery on Market Street - a move that shows the deep divides that still existed after the war.
   
 Perhaps the most notable burial of the wartime was that of Rose O'Neal Greenhow, a Confederate spy who operated out of Washington, D.C., for the first year of the war and became a vital source of intel for early Southern victories. She was captured, imprisoned, exiled to the South and later sent as an emissary to the Confederacy in Europe. She drowned off Fort Fisher on Sept. 30, 1864 while trying to make her way back into America on board the blockade runner Condor.
   
 Moving past the War Between the States, the cemetery would settle into becoming the designated place for some of Wilmington's biggest names. The Bellamys, the Sprunts, the Kenans and the DeRossets are all buried in hard-to- miss plots.
   
 It would be the final home of figures like Rachel Loman, a renowned nurse on the frontlines of World War I; Katherine Mayo Cowan, the first and only woman to be mayor of Wilmington to this day; Henry Bacon, the architect of the Lincoln Memorial; and William Ellerbrook, a dutiful volunteer firefighter who perished in a 1880 fire along with his loyal dog, Boss. The latter pair are buried together.
   
 David Brinkley, a landmark television journalist; and Edward Dudley, the first North Carolina governor elected by a popular vote, are also among those buried there.
   
 Within its borders is also a Hebrew Cemetery ensconced in iron fencing, as well as a Masonic section.
   
 Oakdale became such a desirable place for residents to lay their loved one to rest that around 80 graves would be removed from other burial sites and re- interred there - some predating the cemetery itself.
   
 By the mid-20th century, the cemetery's plots were almost all spoken for, reigniting a need for more burial space. In 1945, an annex was established, connected to the historic section by a small bridge. Five years later, the opening of the Memorial Garden brought the entire cemetery's reach to 95 acres.
   
 Today, Oakdale has retained much of the intention it was built on - to be a place of respect, reflection and recreation.
   
 It is one of the city's most stunning displays of azaleas each spring and tours that wind through its many sections are held monthly, all benefiting Friends of Oakdale Cemetery, a nonprofit that helps preserve its graves and grounds.
   
 Even in a city that only grows bigger and more bustling with each passing day, Oakdale Cemetery has remained a quiet sanctuary in the heart of Wilmington. A protector of some of its greatest stories and showcase of its natural beauty.
   
 Each stroll through its rows is bound to produce new sights and new discoveries, if only you take the time to look around.

For two centuries, as it grew to include members in neighboring towns and adapted to meet the needs of the times, the Willing Workers Society of Sugar Hill hasn’t strayed from its mission — to foster a spirit of helpfulness throughout the community.
 Now, during the coronavirus pandemic, that mission is all the more imperative.
 First conceived in 1829 to assist the needs of a church and the community when the first church was built in Sugar Hill, then a part of Lisbon, the nonprofit, non-sectarian WWSSH was officially founded in 1920 after the merger of two Sugar Hill churches.
 Each year, the group has made donations to worthy causes, awarded scholarships to students furthering their education ($5,000 is expected to be awarded in June), and has supported the community in myriad ways.
 2020, its centennial anniversary, was to be a year of celebratory events folded into a theme called “Over A Century Of Caring.”
 Because of the pandemic, though, those plans, which include some of WWSSH’s biggest fund-raisers of the year, are on hold, Betsy Fraser, WWSSH president, said Friday.
 Although a letdown, the society’s members, about 30 women from area communities, squandered no time homing in all the more on their mission, now to meet a specific community need during a challenging time.
 As dairy farms across the state reel from a plummet in demand for milk during the shutdown that has closed schools and businesses, the WWSSH is buying milk from the local Hatchland dairy farm, in North Haverhill, after learning that Hatchland had to dump milk because of lack of demand.
 Determined to not let it go to waste, society members are now delivering it to local food pantries.
 “Each week on Tuesday morning, one of our members drives to Hatchland and picks up the milk order and spends the morning making deliveries to the pantries,” said Fraser. “We have just completed week two of the program and look forward to many more weeks.”
 The effort aids both Hatchland Dairy as a business and the food pantries meeting a need, she said.
 “Not only are we donating funds to worthy causes, but we invest personal time to make the drive and deliver a valued, nutritious product in person to very deserving pantries — and that makes this program especially gratifying for us,” said Fraser.
 Hatchland products are carried in local stores and the WWSSH knows and cares about the dairy and also regularly donates money to help local food pantries, she said.
 “Motivated by national news showing how individuals and organizations have been able to improve supply chains to get product from farmers to communities that need them, we’ve been able to set up a program whereby we purchase milk weekly from Hatchland and deliver it to three food pantries,” said Fraser.
 Two pantries are in Littleton, at All Saints Episcopal Church and Elevate Church, and the third is the Good Neighbor Pantry in Franconia.
 “We originally allocated $1,600 for the program, and new donations have bolstered the fund to $1,900,” said Fraser. “We are hoping more donations will sustain and extend the program.”
 The additional $300 came from Brenda Aldrich, owner of Harman’s Cheese in Sugar Hill and a WWSSH member.
 Kris May, an owner of the Hatchland dairy farm with her father, Howard Hatch, said since the dairy crisis began in March, there has been positive outreach.
 Hatchland has helped supply milk to the New Hampshire Food Bank and is now partnering with a growing number of local food banks, she said.
 Although still not back to normal, those working with Hatchland are helping to get the dairy closer to a healthy balance, she said.
 “It’s been great working with all the food banks that are helping us out in very challenging times, and it’s great working with the Willing Workers who are getting a product to those who need it and are helping a local business,” said May. “It’s been a good connection and we’re thrilled to see people working together and trying to help everybody get through this.”
 As WWSSH member Dolly McPhaul, of Sugar Hill, was instrumental in making the phone calls to find willing food pantries and make the milk effort successful. Aldrich played a key role through her special grocery box program, which she launched a few months ago to bring in groceries and food from other places, take orders and deliver.
 For that box program that Fraser called “a real asset for the community,” the Willing Workers baked more than 1,000 chocolate chip cookies, bagged them up, and added them to the grocery boxes.
 Aldrich offered to make the WWSSH the recipient of donations for a week.
 “People donated whatever they wanted to be added to their grocery box,” said Fraser. “We earned over $1,600, which is great … We called it Cookies for a Cause.”
 With some of that money, McPhaul this week drove to Hatchland to pick up 57 quarts and 28 half-gallons of milk.
 The society had $2,600 to invest in the community — $500 went to the Meals on Wheels program for area seniors, $250 to St. Paul’s Episcopal Church in Lancaster for a food program for children, and $250 to Lafayette Regional School in Franconia for a children’s food program.
 The $1,600 remaining, originally to be given directly to the food pantries, was then re-purposed for the milk program to the benefit of the pantries, and was augmented with Aldrich’s money to $1,900.
 “The cookie fund was a way to bring in money and immediately turn it around and put it out in the community,” said Fraser. “We’ve been hearing a lot of things in the national news about farmers not being able to get their products to those who need it. We wanted to be that bridge, and give Hatchland business and food pantries milk. The clients the pantries serve are really thrilled with fresh milk.”
 Today, the WWSSH has members not only from Sugar Hill, but from towns that include Lisbon, Littleton, Franconia, Bethlehem, and has a few women from Bretton Woods. It also extends its donations into those communities.
 They meet once a month for lunch.
 “We had been planning a number of things to do this year to celebrate being 100,” said Fraser. “In recent years, we’ve had some successful fund-raisers, and we get a lot of enjoyment donating that money into the community, but this year all of our fund-raising plans are put in hiatus.”
 Their biggest fund-raiser at the Lupine Festival in June that last year netted $5,500 through the sales of bagged lunches is canceled.
 Also planned, but still not certain, is a sale of handcrafted items for the fall festival in September, as well as a Christmas sale in November.
 The Sugar Hill Historical Museum has a theme each year and theme for 2020 was going to focus on the WWSSH.
 “And being that is our centennial year, we were also planning to have a large country tea,” said Fraser. “We would make it a country tea and would get out a silver tea set that the Willing Workers own and fancy tea cups. We had planned one of those for this summer, probably in the August time frame, but now it’s very doubtful.”
 Not content to be idle, the group looked instead to see what efforts can be made in the community.
 Fraser said Aldrich, who lived in Afghanistan for a time, has an Afghan saying — “drop by drop, a river is formed.”
 “That’s what this milk thing is about,” said Fraser. “If there’s any time to act, it’s now. We are celebrating over 100 years of caring and we are as committed to our mission as ever. We won’t let a global pandemic stop us, but rather to inspire us to do more.”

Boone County on Monday reported another six new COVID-19 cases - the most since March 31 - adding to a run of new case reports that exceed the initial growth that triggered the March 24 stay-at-home order.
   
 And on Monday, both Randal Williams, the director of the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, and Tony Helms, sheriff of Camden County, responded videos shared on social media of revelers partying close together at the Lake of the Ozarks.
   
 Williams warned that the virus was still active and asked people to maintain their distance. Helms wrote that "the sheriff's office has no authority to enforce" state orders for social distancing, the Lake Sun-Leader reported.
   
 In Boone County, the increase in new cases came on the eve of the next loosening of restrictions on businesses and gatherings. Bars will be allowed to open and when the state order in effect through Sunday expires, retail outlets will be able to increase customer numbers to 50 percent of capacity.
   
 Since May 18, two weeks after the stay-at-home order lifted, Boone County has reported 23 new infections. From March 17, when the first case was reported, and March 24, when the order was issued, Boone County reported 20 cases.
   
 When case numbers began climbing, the Columbia-Boone County Department of Health and Human Services had not reported a new case for seven days.
   
 As of Monday afternoon there were 22 active cases, 58 people in quarantine in the county and 13 people hospitalized with COVID-19, nine at University of Missouri Hospital and four at Boone Hospital Center.
   
 The Tribune did not receive a response to an email message sent to Health Director Stephanie Browning as well as city and county leaders asking whether the new cases would change any steps being taken this week.
   
 On Monday, the state reported 179 new COVID-19 infections, the fourth consecutive day of more than 150 new cases. That is the first time that has happened in three weeks. The state has reported 12,167 coronavirus infections since the pandemic reached the state in early March.
   
 The state health department reported an additional four deaths Monday, raising the total to 685.
   
 In his message urging Missourians to follow the social distancing rules in the state order -- six feet of separation in gatherings and severely limited capacity in retail outlets and restaurants -- Williams did not specifically mention the lake parties that drew national and worldwide attention.
   
 One video on social media showed a crammed pool at Lake of the Ozarks, with people lounging and playing close together, without masks. The lake draws people from as far away as Arkansas and Iowa.
   
 Bars, restaurants and hotels at Lake of the Ozarks also had big crowds, and they weren't alone. In Hannibal, Mark Twain's hometown and a popular regional tourist attraction, people could be seen sitting shoulder-to-shoulder inside and out at downtown bars and restaurants over the weekend.
   
 The current rules under an order issued April 27 by Williams cite his authority under state law on infectious diseases to "make and enforce adequate orders, findings, rules and regulations to prevent the spread of such diseases and to determine the prevalence of such diseases within the state."
   
 The order leaves it up to local and state health officials to enforce social distancing.
   
 Helms wrote there is no crime related to violating the social distancing requirement.
   
 "We expect residents and visitors alike to exhibit personal responsibility when at the lake," Helms said. "We also respect the right of citizens to move freely around the lake and take responsibility to protect themselves from any expected dangers related to COVID-19."
   
 However, state law does make it a misdemeanor to violate the provisions of an order to control infectious diseases issued by the state health director.
   
 The images clearly caught the eye of other public officials.
   
 "This Memorial Day, we caution that COVID-19 is still here, and social distancing needs to continue to prevent further spread of infections," Williams said in a statement.
   
 Video from the Lake of the Ozarks typically showed younger people. Williams said close contact, even in the outdoors, can lead to more infections, even among the young and healthy who may not experience symptoms.
   
 "When they then carry the virus and transmit it to a more vulnerable person, this is when we tend to see the long-lasting and tragic impact of these decisions that are being made," Williams said.
   
 St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson, in a statement, called it "irresponsible and dangerous" to engage in such high-risk behavior.
   
 "Now, these folks will be coming home to St. Louis and counties all over Missouri and the Midwest, raising concerns about the potential of more positive cases, hospitalizations, and tragically, deaths," Krewson said in a statement. "It's just deeply disturbing."
   
 St. Louis Health Department spokesman Harold Bailey said officials are "greatly concerned" that city residents will return from large gatherings and bring the virus back with them.
   
 "That could negate, or even set back the mitigation efforts we have accomplished up to this point in the pandemic," Bailey said in an email.
   
 St. Louis officials said private commercial labs are experiencing delays in processing coronavirus tests. A news release from the city health department did not name the labs with delays or specify the lag.
   
 Dr. Fredrick Echols, the city's health director, said the delays mean longer wait times for patients wanting to know if they've tested positive. It could also mean that data used to determine the timing of phased-in business re- starts could be skewed.
   
 "Test results are the key to understanding how widely the virus has spread, how it is currently spreading, and its severity," Echols said in a statement.

County officials offered the following suggested tips for residents to help them protect themselves from rabies:
 • Make sure your pets get their rabies shots regularly
 • Keep your pets on your property
 • Do not leave garbage or pet food outside. Food left out may attract wild or stray animals
 • Rabid animals may act tame. They may also display strange or unusual behavior. They may act aggressive, avoid food and water, foam at the mouth, have trouble moving or move in a stiff, odd way. Stay away from any unknown animals, especially wildlife. Report any animal acting unusual to Gwinnett County Animal Welfare and Enforcement.
 • Stay away from wild, sick, hurt or dead animals. Do not pick up or move sick or hurt animals.
 • Do not keep wild animals like raccoons, skunks, foxes and coyotes as pets. It is dangerous and also illegal
 • Teach your children not to go near, tease or play with wild animals or strange dogs and cats

Apple and Google grabbed headlines this month when they jointly announced an ambitious plan to digitally trace COVID-19 patients' real-world contacts through the signals on their smartphones. The proposal has sparked fierce debate among privacy advocates.
   
 While COVID-19 tracing may be a socially useful example of products which gain value with increased number of users in their networks, these joint efforts can kill competition and hurt the economy. Together, Apple and Google control more than 99% of the smartphone marketplace. Just as Microsoft sought to leverage its monopoly over operating systems in the 1990s to dominate internet browsers and digital apps until law enforcement stopped it, Apple is now using its "gatekeeper" power to take over huge swaths of the digital economy.
   
 Take mobile gaming. The industry generated nearly $70 billion globally last year. In an effort to gain primacy in this hugely lucrative market for its Arcade gaming app, Apple blocked competitive gaming apps from Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia on iPhones and iPads, flipping its master switch to shut out its rivals.
   
 Music is another giant revenue stream, raking in $9 billion annually, that Apple seeks to colonize. Monopolizing digital distribution confers not only sizable chunks of revenue but huge brand benefits. Apple can't outright ban competitors like Spotify which are wildly popular with millennials and generation Z'ers. Instead, Apple uses other gatekeeper strategies to squash competition, like charging rivals a 30% tax for all in-app purchases. This allows Apple to raise prices for competitors, poach profits of adversaries, potentially forcing them out of the market altogether.
   
 Such heavy-handed business practices are starting to spark louder complaints from regulators and app developers. Most recently the apps community accused Apple of burying the search results of competitor apps in their App Store and kicking popular apps off entirely after stealing their best features for Apple's competing software.
   
 This is similar to Microsoft's strategy in the 1990s until DOJ action enabled upstart companies like Google, Facebook and Netflix to gain their sea-legs and they became hugely successfully, innovative firms. But these things have a way of coming full circle. Now the big tech giants are mimicking the precise anti- competitive practices that could have killed them when they were smaller upstarts just a generation ago.
   
 Already Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple are facing massive investigations and fines in the U.S. and EU for unfair competition in digital advertising, retail, apps and social media, as well as for privacy violations. Federal and state prosecutors are preparing to initiate antitrust suits against Google as soon this summer. Both the federal and state investigations are focused on Google's ad business. Big tech typically responds with public shows of remorse and promises to reform. But these shopworn pledges have all proven ineffective - regulatory slaps on the wrist that monopolists shrug off as the cost of business.
   
 Real change-makers would be forceful structural reforms like those that forced AT&T; to break up, and the threat of them in the Microsoft case, which stopped monopoly rule and opened up future innovation.
   
 If Apple were denied gatekeeper control of the apps market through its App Store, it would lose its incentive to kill competition in apps markets. If Amazon were prevented from marketing its own products on its dominant retail platform, it wouldn't have the motive to crush retail competitors. Google's incentive to bury the search results of its competitors in a vast array of services like travel goes away if its search and service offerings are separated into different companies. And so on.
   
 Such remedies require a steel stomach to take on popular monopolies and their army of lobbyists. The proud tradition of antitrust regulators standing up to giants stopped after the Microsoft case lay largely dormant in the last decade. As we pick up the pieces in a post-COVID-19 economy, and seek to revive competition and innovation and protect the common person, this is the kind of fortitude we need. That's the story of our past, and hopefully the story of our future.

There are ominous signs that the markets are beginning to turn the screw. One ratings agency recently reduced Italy’s credit status to one notch above junk, and government bond yields are steadily creeping upwards.
 It is in this menacing context that the European Union may soon have a crucial judgment to make. Along with the leaders of eight other countries, including France, Spain and Portugal, Mr. Conte has called for a new common EU debt instrument to raise funds to assist recovery. Germany and the Netherlands have resisted this idea, pointing to existing options such as the European stability mechanism, which allows for countries in difficulty to receive guaranteed loans.

 CTD's _Judge Judy_ remained atop the court shows and was the   highest rated show in all of daytime syndication for the 23rd time in   25 weeks with a 4.1. That's down 2% from the prior week but up 11% from last   year. In second place, CTD's _Judge Joe Brown_ dipped 5% to a 2.0. Warner Bros.' _People's   Court_ lost 6% to a new season low 1.7, tying Warner Bros.' _Judge Mathis_ , which   gained 6%. Twentieth's _Judge Alex_ was flat at a 1.3, tying Twentieth's _Divorce   Court_, which jumped 8%. Warner Bros.' _Judge Jeannine Pirro_ trailed at an unchanged   1.1.
 Game shows were mostly flat, with only Debmar-Mercury's    _Family Feud_ showing signs of life, gaining 7% to a 1.6. CTD's genre leader    _Wheel of Fortune_ was flat at a 5.8. CTD's _Jeopardy!_ faded 2% to a 4.8. Disney-ABC's    _Who Wants to be Millionaire_ and Twentieth's _Are You Smarter than a Fifth Grader_   each were unchanged at a 2.2 and 1.2, respectively.

Twentieth's    _Family Guy_ and CTD's _Everybody Loves Raymond_ continued to   duke it out for second place, tying this week with _Raymond_ sliding 3% to a 3.0 and _Family   Guy_ holding steady. NBCU's _The Office_   fell 4% to a 2.7. Sony's _Seinfeld_ stayed   steady at a 2.6. Warner Bros.' _George   Lopez_ rebounded 25% to a 2.5 after a 17% drop the prior week. Twentieth's _King of the Hill_ was flat at a 2.2.
 Among the new nationally syndicated first-run entries, which   debuted Monday, Sept. 13, CTD's Swift _Justice   with Nancy Grace_ held steady at a 1.1 rating/3 share weighted metered   market average, according to Nielsen, even with its lead-in and off 8% from its   year-ago time period average.
 Sony's _Nate Berkus_   fell 8% in day two to a 1.1/4, down 8% from its lead-in but up 10% from last   year's time period averages.

This month, books by a couple of accomplished novelists who are almost always worth listening to.
 "Redhead by the Side of the Road"
 By Anne Tyler, read by MacLeod Andrews.   Unabridged, 5 hours.   Penguin Random House Audio, $12.99.
 Micah Mortimer lives an unremarkable life in an unremarkable house in Baltimore. An apartment-building super and freelance computer repairman heading into middle age, he has a woman friend -- he won't call a woman in her late 30s his girlfriend -- and grown sisters, and really, no need for anything more.
 He has a day each week for every household chore, a place for everything and everything in its place. When driving, he always uses his turn signal, even in his building's parking lot.
 Then his well-ordered world is disrupted, first by his girlfriend's announcement that she may be evicted from her apartment, and then by the arrival on his doorstep of the teenaged son of an old flame. In Micah's small world, these are seismic upheavals -- but will either of them have the power to shake his foundation?
 Tyler, Pulitzer-Prize winning author of such books as "The Accidental Tourist" and "Breathing Lessons," specializes in well-observed stories populated by people who feel real. Micah feels real enough that you might find yourself talking to him out loud, wondering whether he will ever wise up and do the obvious right thing.
 At just five hours, the story feels slight enough that you also might wish for something bigger. But that's better, I guess, than wondering when a too-long tale will ever end.
 Andrews gives a warm reading that paints Micah in shades of gray and the other characters in more vibrant hues.
 "The Red Lotus"
 By Chris Bohjalian, read by Rebecca Lowman.   Unabridged, 12 hours.   Penguin Random House Audio, $14.99.
 When emergency-room doctor Alexis Remnick agrees to go on a bike trip to Vietnam with her boyfriend, she unknowingly opens the door to extreme danger -- for herself, and for the world.
 Austin Harper, it turns out, is into some very deep stuff. But Alexis hasn't a clue until he disappears while on a solo ride, leaving behind only three energy gels lying in the middle of a road far from any village or town. Her urge to find out what happened, and what springs from that urge, make up the bulk of the story.
 Telling you too much would do this book and you a disservice -- with his usual strong plotting and well-conceived characters, Bohjalian's story unfolds slowly and with terrific pacing. But at this moment of pandemic, I have to give you fair warning that pandemic -- and efforts to stop it -- are inextricably wound up in "The Red Lotus."
 Lowman gives a professional reading that doesn't paint memorable characters but doesn't get in the way.

MILFORD -- When Capt. Justin Barter and Lt. Michael Blanchette pulled up to a house on South Central Street on Saturday morning, the homeowner was at her front door waiting.
 She was among about 200 people last week who ordered an American flag from the Milford Salvation Army's "Fly the Flag" campaign, which had just kicked off, said Barter. The woman was also one of about 60 homeowners that day who had crisp, red-white-and-blue flags staked on their front lawns, and one of many who greeted the pair from their doorways, eager to see the flags installed.
 "It's pretty dire out there, but this kind of gives a little bit of a ray of hope for folks," said Barter, his second year leading this effort. "I'm hoping that when people see it, they realize, that if they are down and out, that there are those who care about them in the community and want to see good things happen to those who are struggling right now."
 One homeowner amped up his patriotism by purchasing eight flags for his front yard.
 As Blanchette dug a small hole in the front lawn to stick in a flagpole, Barter said they would normally have installed about 400 American flags throughout Milford, Mendon and Hopedale before Memorial Day. But because of the pandemic, Draper Park in downtown Milford has been closed.
 That's where about 200 of their flags typically go.
 But even as the number of flags being staked declined, the number of residents who benefit from funds raised during the campaign skyrocketed.
 Now in its seventh year, the Fly the Flag campaign raises money for The Salvation Army in Milford's emergency assistance program, which includes feeding and seasonal assistance.
 The Memorial Day flags will remain until the Fourth of July, at which time they'll be switched out for new flags in time for Labor Day, 9/11 and Veterans Day.
 So far they've raised about $8,500; their goal is more than $25,000.
 "We've seen such a huge uptick (in needs) during the coronavirus," said Barter about recent operations at The Salvation Army in Milford. "We've really tripled, and in some instances quadrupled our number (of those being served)."
 Before the coronavirus hit, the charity was serving about 10 families a week, he said. Now it's closer to 40, totaling about 200 individuals.
 "And it's people who have never been (to a food pantry) before," he said, citing those who work in the food industry or in construction.
 "I've had business owners come in for food," he said. "People who say, 'I started up a hair salon six months ago and I don't qualify for unemployment now,' so they're out of business completely. They're not coming back from it."
 But immigrants, he said, have been hit hardest. They comprise most of the home deliveries The Salvation Army makes to homeowners who have tested positive for COVID-19.
 "It's a real struggle, and for many folks in that population, many work as day laborers, or in construction -- they're not getting work right now. Nobody's putting on a roof at the moment," Barter said. "Every now and then you'll see a roofing truck giving out food."
 Now more than ever, the charitable organization is seeking donations from residents, as their main source of food is running low.
 "Our biggest problem is that food banks are starting to run dry, and we rely on those to fill our pantries," he said, citing difficulty that the Worcester County Food Bank has been having in obtaining its regular amount of donations.
 Ordering from different stores can be pricier, and some are starting to run low on meat and other basic food products, he said.
 "When folks are willing to donate food, that's always a blessing," he said.
 To donate to the campaign, residents can visit massachusetts.salvationarmy.org/MA/Milford. It costs $50 to sponsor a 3-by-5-foot American flag on a 10-foot staff.
 Blanchette, who serves for The Salvation Army in Framingham, was helping Barter because Milford's usual volunteers couldn't come together amid the pandemic. But he also wants to learn how to implement the program over in his community.
 The same issues Barter mentioned closely mirrored what Blanchette was seeing in the region, especially among the immigrant population.
 ″(This program) is unique to this area, but I have a feeling it's going to catch on," Blanchette said.

The Supreme Court's decision to make audio tapes   of its oral arguments available to the press and public on a weekly basis   sounds like a win for journalists and organizations who have long pushed for   greater access, but it turns out to be a double-edged sword, according to   C-SPAN.
 "Beginning with October Term 2010, the audio   recordings of all oral arguments heard by the Supreme Court of the United   States will be available free to the public on the Court's Web site, www.supremecourt.gov,   at the end of each argument week," the courts said Tuesday. "The   audio recordings will be posted on Fridays after Conference."
 While the court agreed to make recordings   available each Friday, it is discontinuing its policy of occasionally allowing   same-day release of the tapes, a court spokesperson confirmed. "The Court will   discontinue the occasional practice of expediting the release of audio   recordings prompted by requests from the media and based on the level of public   interest," said Kathleen Arberg, public information officer for the court.
 Why? In part, apparently, because it was tough to   determine whether the public's interest in a case was high enough to justify   the same-day release, which was a key factor in granting the requests.   "The new practice will significantly accelerate access in all cases,   provide direct access to the public, and it will eliminate the difficult task   of assessing the public's interest," she said.
 "While we applaud The Court's new policy, which   helps advance the cause of greater public access to the institution, we do   regret that it comes at the expense of occasional same-day release of arguments   in cases with heightened public interest," said C-SPAN President Susan   Swain in a statement. "Reporting on these key cases will be out for several   days before the public is able to hear the arguments for themselves, in the   Justices' own words."
 All arguments are scheduled for Monday-Wednesday.
 C-SPAN will continue to push for same-day release   of recordings and TV coverage of arguments.

 But as we plan for life outside the work-from-home bubble, dog owners are being urged to consider how their pets might cope with our "new normal".
 After more than two months of staying at home, working from home and staying close to home on walks, the easing of restrictions could have an adverse effect on animals.
 A Glasgow-based vet has issued some invaluable guidance.
 ## Separation anxiety
 He says easing dogs out of lockdown is much more complex than being able to go for a longer walk or leaving them in the house more and it could manifest in upsetting physical symptoms.

Most of the shots in the pipeline aim to train the immune system to recognize the “spike” protein that studs the coronavirus’ outer surface, priming the body to react if it ever encountered the real infection. Some candidates are made using just the genetic code for that protein, and others use a harmless virus to deliver the protein-producing information. Still other vaccine candidates are more old-fashioned, made with the killed whole virus.

We only have a few storms in the forecast: a 20%-30% chance for the afternoon and evening (although wouldn't be impossible to see some rain in a few communities early in the day). Even though storms may be few in number, a couple of them still could be very heavy with torrential rain, gusty winds and lightning.

The European commission forecasts a downturn of more than 9% this year. That would send the country’s public debt soaring to over 155% of GDP – easily the highest ratio, after Greece, in the eurozone. Yet with business on its knees, the government has been obliged to up the ante on spending. Mr Conte’s government signed off last week on a stimulus package worth $59.6bn. This injection of cash, combined with a steep fall in tax revenue, is likely to drive the annual budget deficit up to more than 10% of GDP.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. (WMC) - As Mid-Southerners come together for Memorial Day weekend, health experts urge them not to let their guard down.The experts say they understand it's tempting to want to hang out in a big crowd, but they say we're not out of the woods yet.In fact, since Friday more than 300 new cases have been reported in Shelby County.Cases continue to rise in Tennessee, Arkansas and Mississippi as well."How we stand now really depends on kind of our behaviors now," said Dr. Steve Threlkeld, an infectious disease specialist at Baptist Memorial Hospital. "The virus is still out there waiting for us."Threlkeld says until now, the things we've been doing have been working, like social distancing."We still have a fairly low amount of virus in our community, that's a good thing, of course. The only challenging thing there is that there are still a lot of people in our community who can still get infected and transmit the virus after we relax things," said Threlkeld.He says as more of the Mid-South reopens, we'll need to watch for a "delayed uptick" in cases after Memorial Day."As we open things up, it may be that at first we won't see a large uptick in cases. But then as we move further relax and as there's more travel, bringing the virus into our city in higher concentration and higher numbers, we can see a delayed uptick in numbers," said Threlkeld. "So we have to stay vigilant in the coming few weeks, even as we relax some of the things that we've been doing to prevent the virus."The Shelby County Health Department says 4,404 cases have been confirmed in Shelby County; 93 people have died and 2,974 have recovered.There was an uptick in the testing positivity rate last week in Shelby County, which doubled from a low of 2.9% in early May to more than 6% on Thursday.But that’s still below the 10% rate that officials say would cause them concern.Statewide, the Tennessee Health Department says 20,607 Tennesseans have gotten COVID-19 and 338 have died as of May 25. More than 13,000 have recovered.Mississippi reports 13, 458 cases along with 635 deaths and Arkansas reports 6,029 cases and 116 deaths.Copyright 2020 WMC. All rights reserved.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The Monaco Grand Prix has been canceled.
   
 The Indianapolis 500 is postponed until August.
   
 Only the Coca-Cola 600 is still scheduled as planned.
   
 The most celebrated day in motorsports has been whittled down to the third course, 600 miles around Charlotte Motor Speedway in NASCAR's longest race of the year. What began as the World 600 in 1959 became the nightcap to a spectacular day of automobile racing treasured annually by fans.
   
 The Sunday before Memorial Day begins in the French Riviera as Formula One races the streets of Monaco. The race began in 1929 and has been held every year since 1959 until the coronavirus pandemic wiped out a portion of F1's season.
   
 Then it is on to Indianapolis Motor Speedway on the corner of Georgetown Road and 16th Street for the Indy 500. It started as the International 500-Mile Sweepstakes Race in 1911, grew into "The Greatest Spectacle in Racing" and has run on Memorial Day weekend every year since 1946. Roger Penske, in his first year as owner, has postponed the race two months because of the pandemic.
   
 It means NASCAR is alone in the spotlight Sunday night, just as NASCAR has been for the last week. The stock car series, using a tight health screening plan and aided by its close proximity to states with relaxed restrictions. has already completed three races in the last week.
   
 The next one is a crown jewel event that doubles as an elaborate salute to the United States military. The dusk-to-dark race is an actual Memorial Day party as fallen heroes are honored on each car and Speedway Motorsports prides itself on productions that conclude with a post-race fireworks spectacular.
   
 The race itself is one of the most grueling of the season. It's almost always hot, the race is 100 miles longer than any other and it is a true battle of attrition. It's not always the most exciting event and NASCAR has struggled over the years to find an aerodynamic package capable of compelling competition.
   
 Still, drivers love this event and many teams thrive in the challenge of tackling a 600-miler. They also respect what the Coca-Cola 600 has become over the last 61 years.
   
 "I think for our hardcore fans and for the people that appreciate the history of NASCAR, the 600 is it's own kind of animal and it's own show," said Martin Truex Jr. "For us in the sport and drivers especially, it's a big one and it's one we all want to win."
   
 Here's a look at the top topics going into Charlotte:
   
 KEEPING THE MOMENTUM
   
 Even with rain disruptions, NASCAR had a good first week back at Darlington Raceway. Kevin Harvick got his first win of the season and 50th of his career in the first race, and Denny Hamlin won for the third time at Darlington in the first Wednesday race in 34 years.
   
 Both races at Darlington were compelling and the Xfinity Series finish Thursday came down to a last-lap battle Chase Briscoe won over Kyle Busch.
   
 Now comes the 600, which often turns into green-flag runs where cars are stretched into a long parade lap. Strategy, tire conservation and luck can factor into the race in a combination that often doesn't make for for good television. That's the only viewing option though because spectators are no t permitted, so NASCAR must hope the casual sports fan sticks with the racing.
   
 A snoozer of a race could spoil NASCAR's current high.
   
 "It's the Coca-Cola 600 and you cannot change that," Joey Logano said. "It's a good race track and it's going to be intense out there from lap one. It's 100% from lap one. We're hammer down every lap."
   
 TRUEX'S PLAYGROUND
   
 No one has excelled at Charlotte like Truex, who has two wins, a second-place finish and a third in his last four 600s. Truex has led 625 of 1,200 laps in that span.
   
 He is winless so far this season, his second at Joe Gibbs Racing and first since crew chief Cole Pearn's startling offseason retirement. But Truex is heating up and grabbed a pair of top-10 finishes at Darlington.
   
 He's confident there's been no slip under new crew chief James Small.
   
 "I feel like we really picked up where we left off last year," Truex said of last year's seven-win season. "We're right there and James is doing an awesome job."
   
 BUSCH VS. ELLIOTT
   
 Chase Elliott flipped Busch the bird after Busch wrecked Elliott racing for the win Wednesday night.
   
 Elliott has twice been voted by fans as NASCAR's most popular driver and Busch is notoriously disliked, so the on-track incident has the makings for a good, old-fashioned feud. Instead, Busch has publicly accepted blame and called Elliott to apologize.
   
 Elliott accepted that Busch made a mistake but can't help being bitter. Busch went on to finish second in a 1-2 with Hamlin for Joe Gibbs Racing; Elliott was 38th.
   
 "I get that mistakes happen, that's part of life and I get it," Elliott said. "He's just not a guy that makes many mistakes, so for me to be on the poor end of a rare mistake on his end is, at the end of the day, unfortunate for me and my team."
   
 FLYOVER
   
 The pre-race party isn't entirely ruined as speedway officials are still managing the NASCAR tradition of a flyover after the national anthem.
   
 The invocation, anthem and stating command will be done virtually, but the Air Force Heritage Flight will still make a fly-by to spark some electricity at the otherwise empty event.

Because the hostel was closed for nearly two months, Laughing Heart didn’t generate the usual amount of revenue for Nagle’s care. And although the hostel has now reopened, it’s still seeing a sharp decline in business compared to normal. Love says that the Greensboro-based nonprofit Corporation for Guardianship and the generosity of guests has continued to support Nagle through this difficult time.
