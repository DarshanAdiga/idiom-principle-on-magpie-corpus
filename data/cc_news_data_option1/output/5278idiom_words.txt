_Wonder Woman 1984_ has plenty of goofiness—the aforementioned magic wishing stone, an action sequence at the mall with the aesthetics of a cheesy Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, and, in Cheetah, a villain who has seemingly leaped from the set of Tom Hooper’s _Cats_. But that levity complements the movie’s heart- on-sleeve storytelling, in which Diana can win a major battle by simply making an intense emotional appeal, and the best way for humanity to save itself is to embrace selflessness. That tone fits the film’s hero as snugly as her shiny golden armor does.

Read: Shakespeare didn’t write alone
  _Lear_ ’s lens on human being has been ground in such a way as to make it possible to see our troubles acutely, undistracted by hope. Reading the play each Advent exposes my raw, ongoing questions and perplexities. It also prepares me for the quiet shock of a vulnerable baby as God’s answer to human horror. Freshly wrapped in the depths of our personal and collective _Lear_ s, Christians for two millennia have greeted God’s breathtaking, swaddled self. Each story is as unremitting as the other. Sentimentality is swiftly squelched by both. When they are held in their audacious collision, I know Advent is done. The waiting and the darkness begin to give way to hope.
 Christmas is here.
