Next, it’s important to make sure you take a seat at the table, both physically and psychologically. Settling for a seat at the back of the room or against the wall can make you invisible to those at the table and removes you from the intellectual challenge and visibility of the conversation. Arrive early, take a seat at the table and feel confident that you’ve earned that seat to participate in the conversation. Every person brings a unique perspective to a conversation, and it's the collection of these ideas that make a company, project or campaign truly stand out.

Lettera di incoraggiamento a tutto il personale in dotazione all’Azienda Ecoross che ha in appalto il servizio di Igiene Urbana in molti comuni della regione Calabria. “Pronti a fare la nostra parte per sconfiggerlo”, così esordiscono l’Amministratore unico Walter Pulignano e il procuratore nonché responsabile operativo Eugenio Pulignano, con riferimento alla drammatica emergenza mondiale e nazionale del COVID-19. Disposta, nel frattempo, la chiusura del FRONT OFFICE presso la sede legale della società in contrada Sant’Irene a Corigliano Rossano fino a nuove determinazioni, ma viene garantita comunque la possibilità di comunicare con il personale addetto mediante i canali telematici esistenti (social, email, telefono).

Angesichts des immer ausgeprägteren Hangs zur Gadget-gestützten (Selbst-)Kontrolle verwundert es kaum, dass auch Unternehmen wie Facebook mittlerweile über sensibelste Gesundheitsinformationen verfügen. Eine Auswertung des _Wall Street Journal_ zeigte im Februar 2019, wie zahlreiche Health-Apps Daten an den Konzern weitergaben – von der Herzfrequenz über das Gewicht bis zum Tracking der Menstruationszyklen. Zwar etabliert sich langsam – siehe DSGVO oder die ePrivacy-Verordnung der EU – ein Rechtsrahmen, der den ungezügelten Datenverkehr eindämmt. Doch scheinen die Konzerne aus dem Silicon Valley – trotz der ‚reumütigen‘ Ernennung allerlei „Chief Privacy Officers“ – mit dem Einstieg in neue Erwerbsfelder weiterhin lukrative Wege zu beschreiten, die ihre Informationsquellen sprudeln lassen; die aber, wie das European Data Protection Board über Googles _merge_ mit Fitbit verkündete, auch weiterhin „ein hohes Risiko für die Privatsphäre und den Datenschutz mit sich bringen.“ Die deutsche Verbraucherzentrale erklärte schon im November 2019, dass die 28 Millionen Nutzer_innen Fitbits ihre Daten nur „schützen“ könnten, indem sie sie löschten. Eine Reaktion, die der Resignation recht nahekommt. Und dabei aufzeigt, dass wirkliche Datensouveränität – gerade mit Blick auf die Regulierung eines globalen Datenverkehrs – in Zeiten der _connectedness_ aktuell nur wenig realistisch scheint.

 Fedde spoke for the state on the theft charge. He said Dewane was not a suitable candidate for probation and had taken part in a felony-level theft. He asked the court to sentence Dewane to a term of 18 months to three years in state prison.

Bei solchen „Spielereien“ scheint der klassisch-institutionalisierte Kontrolleur jedoch nie weit zu sein. Während Fitbit in Singapur gleich mit dem _Health Promotion Board_ der Regierung zusammenarbeitet und bis zu einer Millionen Bürger_innen des Inselstaats mit Fitnesstrackern ausstatten will, werden diese aktuell auch immer häufiger von hiesigen Krankenversicherungen in ihre Bonusprogramme eingebaut. Die Versicherten sollen dabei mit gezielten Anreizen (beispielsweise Gutscheine für Amazon oder den Apple App Store) und fröhlich gamifizierten Prämienmodellen zu einem gesünderen Lebensstil motiviert werden, sodass eine angeleitete Selbstkontrolle im Gewand des Angebots, des freundlichen Services daherkommt. Was Michel Foucault in _Überwachen und Strafen_ noch mit Blick auf die alten Verfahren der Disziplinierung beschrieb, kann dank Wearable scheinbar sehr viel reibungsloser funktionieren: „derjenige, welcher der Sichtbarkeit unterworfen ist und dies weiß, […] internalisiert das Machtverhältnis, in welchem er gleichzeitig beide Rollen spielt; er wird zum Prinzip der eigenen Unterwerfung.“

Agreements for a K-12 education funding package for the next school year were passed by both the Senate and the House. Additional money going to K-12 amounts to almost $100 million in new funding for schools. This money will include $7.65 million for transportation equity and $5.8 million for per pupil equity. The bill passed out of the Senate on Wednesday and goes to the governor for her signature.
 The Senate also passed Senate File 2366 this week. This bill requires individuals receiving taxpayer-funded health care or food assistance to work, volunteer, obtain job training, or other schooling. This bill only applies to able-bodied adults and includes many exceptions for those who are not able to work, such as someone who is pregnant, medically exempt, or a caregiver. The concepts behind this bill have been in the works for three years and have involved many people and departments. The bill also coincides with actions being taken at the federal level.
 In the laboratory of democracy known as our 50 United States, America has thrived like no other country in the history of the world. Simple policies and ideas like liberty and private property sustain America. Among these uniquely American traits are work and our work ethic.
 The goal of SF 2366 is to encourage work. It is designed to ensure those who really need it are the ones using taxpayer-funded social programs. It aims to encourage those individuals on public assistance to find careers that could change and improve the lives of them and their families. With the many businesses looking for more workers, this policy works to address that need.
