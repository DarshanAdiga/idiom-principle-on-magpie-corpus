Bengaluru-based Deepayan Mallick, 27, finds himself in a tight spot due to the ongoing covid-19 crisis. He was forced to take a 20% salary cut, effective March, which means he got a lower salary at the beginning of April. With 60% of his salary going towards education loan and other EMIs, and fixed expenses such as rent, he is using his savings to bridge the gap in his cash flows, but he fears his savings may run out soon. “I don’t want to defer paying my EMIs because that will be more expensive in the long term. I think I’ll have to fall back on my family if things don’t normalize soon,” said Mallick, an account manager at a content marketing firm.

But if Coloradans drop their guard and stop social distancing and other measures, such as wearing masks, "we will go back to 'Stay at Home,' " the governor warned. However, Polis said he is confident Coloradans will continue to be as vigilant in May as they have been in April. "The people of our great state are what gives me faith that we will be successful [but] we're not out of the woods yet."
 Polis addressed the patchwork of orders issued by counties and municipalities around stay at home/safer at home Monday, stating local governments have three options, to match state guidelines, offer more protections or impose local flexibility.
 Under that local flexibility, local governments must show either a low number of new cases per day or a decline in cases for the past 14 days. In addition, they must include an early warning system to swiftly detect any increase in community spread to prevent a breach of the local health care system capacity. The local governments also need approval from the local public health agency, local hospitals and the county commissions or other county-level governing body. Polis said Mesa and Eagle counties have met the criteria, but Weld County has not yet seen a decline in the number of cases or hospitalizations.
 Those that disregard the orders are breaking the law, jeopardizing emergency preparedness grants, putting lives at risk, increasing disruption to businesses and jobs, and spreading the virus, Polis said.
 Businesses that violate the public health order could be issued a "cease and desist" order and may have their business licenses revoked, he explained.
 For businesses to reopen, they must have distancing in place, regular hand washing and sterilization of surfaces, increased air ventilation, and a requirement that employees wear masks and gloves.
 Polis also addressed concerns for employees who either fall into the vulnerable population category or who are struggling to return to work because of lack of childcare and with schools closed for the rest of the school year.

Two California physicians went viral on social media last weekend with a video questioning why the need for so much financial ruin. They calculated the odds of dying from COVID-19 in California at 0.03%.
 “Does that necessitate sheltering in place?” asks Dr. Dan Erickson. “Does that necessitate shutting down medical systems? Does that necessitate people being out of work?”
 It does, says the chorus of the mainstream national press. CNN Anchor Jake Tapper interrogated Polis Sunday about re-opening Colorado's economy so soon. Tapper pointed out that Denver Mayor Michael Hancock isn’t going along with it.
 “We have a very big, diverse state,” Polis said. “Denver, 2,500 cases, that’s like 5% of their population… We also have counties in our state with zero, like Bent County. We have counties with a very low rate, like Mesa County. One of the very first counties that was hit hard, Eagle County … it’s been one of the first to emerge from the stay-at-home phase through a request by their health community, their hospital, their commissioners.”
 Tapper asked Polis if his reopening plan could "cost your constituents their lives.”
 “What matters a lot more than the date that the stay-at-home ends is what we do going forward and how we have an ongoing, sustainable way — psychologically, economically, and from a health perspective — to have the social distancing we need at workplaces, where people recreate, and across the board. If we can’t succeed at doing that in an ongoing basis the stay-at-home was for nothing. It doesn’t accomplish anything if it’s not replaceable with practices that are sustainable for the weeks and months that lie ahead of us.”
 He’s right. We cannot continue on a path of economic, psychological, and physical-health destruction in a futile effort to dodge an invisible virus.
 Community leaders have the trust of the people who elected them. They should take charge. Coordinate with the governor and get people working again with policies, practices, and procedures we can live with and sustain.

And I was alone.
 I started to document the rash on my back as I would a news story -- taking photos daily, tracking its growth and the different symptoms. I FaceTimed my parents and sister who were together in my childhood home in Connecticut to ask their opinion. My parents sounded concerned. My sister, studying for the MCAT so she can become a doctor herself, demanded regular updates.
 I was too scared to go to the emergency room or urgent care. This was when coronavirus deaths in New York City were rising. Hospitals were overwhelmed, and protective gear was limited. I feared even a short visit could expose me to the virus.
 So, I went the telemedicine route. Two different doctors a few days apart, looking at my rash on a tiny screen, prescribed me anti-inflammatories, steroids and even silver cream for burns. Each trip to the pharmacy -- there were five over the course of a week, far more than I was comfortable with -- felt harrowing. One day, I waited in a line that stretched down Flatbush Avenue, each person 6 feet apart, for 30 minutes so I could buy more hydrocortisone cream and a heating pad. Another visit, I glared at a man standing too close to me at the prescription counter over the top of my mask. He backed up, but not far enough.
 Did I stand too close to the pharmacy associate? What about the time I forgot to wear a mask? Did I put on hand sanitizer after I had to touch the stylus to sign my name at the checkout counter? Had I exposed someone? Had I been exposed myself?
 I hit a breaking point one night when I could barely stand up from the pain and called my mom in tears. It was after my mom's regular 9 p.m. bedtime, but she answered the phone as she always does. "I wish I could be there with you, my baby," she told me as I screamed about the electric drill I felt screwing into my back and about my skin, which felt like it was on fire. It was too much for me to pretend to be calm anymore.
 But we both knew she couldn't be there. She's a vulnerable older person, though she'll hate that I called her that. And even if I could get to Connecticut, I'd have to isolate in my parents' basement, not knowing what I had carried from the city, and I couldn't be sure I wouldn't expose them even if we were careful.

America's sole enemy during the Revolutionary War (1775-1783) was England. Ever since being defeated in that war, England (controlled by the British aristocracy) has tried various ways to regain its control over America. The British aristocracy's latest attempt to regain control over America started in 1877, and continues today, as the two countries' "Deep State" — comprising not only the lying CIA and the lying MI6, but the entire joint operation of the united aristocracies of Britain and the U.S. These two aristocracies actually constitute the Deep State, and control the top levels of both intelligence agencies, and of both Governments, and prevent democracy in both countries. The aristocracy rules each of them. The 1877 plan was for a unification of the two aristocracies, and for the then-rising new world power, American industry, and its Government, to become controlled by the wealthiest individuals in both countries. Franklin Delano Roosevelt had tried to break the back of that intended global-imperialist combine, but he tragically died before he achieved this goal.
