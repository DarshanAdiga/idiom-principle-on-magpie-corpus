It was the second time the Padres hit consecutive shots in the playoffs. The first was when Greg Vaughn and Tony Gwynn connected off San Diego native David Wells in the fifth inning of Game 1 of the 1998 World Series at Yankee Stadium. New York swept that series.

It‚Äôs more camper-size to fit into the NASA Orion capsules that will carry astronauts to the moon in a few years.
 Station residents will test it out for a few months. If the shakedown goes well, the toilet will be open for regular business.
 ## Many changes
 With SpaceX now launching astronauts to the space station and Boeing less than a year from sending up its first crew, more toilets are needed. The new one will be in its own stall alongside the old one on the U.S. side of the outpost.
 The old toilets cater more toward men. To better accommodate women, NASA tilted the seat on the new toilet and made it taller. The new shape should help astronauts position themselves better for No. 2, said Johnson Space Center‚Äôs Melissa McKinley, the project manager.
 Cleaning up a mess is a big deal. We don‚Äôt want any misses or escapes, she said.
 Let‚Äôs just say everything floats in weightlessness.
 As for No. 1, the funnels also have been redesigned. Women can use the elongated and scooped-out funnels to urinate while sitting on the commode to poop at the same time, Ms. McKinley said. Until now, it‚Äôs been one or the other for female astronauts, she noted.

FALL RIVER - Bob Karam says he knows an investment opportunity when he sees one.
 "I'm betting on the rail," he said.
 The founder and president of Fall River-based Karam Financial Group has wagered on what he anticipates will be the positive impact of the South Coast Rail project in stimulating economic growth.
 And particularly as it pertains to the Davol Street and Route 79/138 corridor adjacent the Taunton River running north from Braga Bridge to the now-defunct Brightman Street Bridge.
 The $1.1 billion MassDOT Phase 1 commuter rail project will connect Fall River, New Bedford and Taunton to Boston's South Station. Department of Transportation officials have said it will be completed by late 2023.
 "People will need a place to live, restaurants to go to and businesses to buy things," said Karam, whose business holdings include BK's Beacon Tavern on Airport Road and radio station WSAR in Somerset.
 But it's not just South Coast Rail that convinced the 76-year-old Karam to get involved in two independent redevelopment projects situated almost within sight of one another -- each of which sits on opposite sides of the central Route 79/138 corridor.
 Another major factor, he said, was MassDOT's Route 79-Davol Street Corridor Improvements Project.
 That project's $68 million second phase, which is due to be completed no later than 2025, will reconfigure Davol Street and Route 79 in order to create "an urban boulevard," made possible by lowering the level of the elevated, northbound section of Route 79.
 "The whole highway is coming down and being lowered to river level," Karam said.
 He says that he and Swansea-based BayCoast Bank are partners in a $12 million venture to transform the site of the former Davol Street Cafe at 697 Davol St. into a six-story building -- with 49 apartments on five floors and a BayCoast Bank branch with drive-thru lane on the first floor.
 Karam and BayCoast Bank, doing business as BCBBK LLC, in 2017 paid a total of $780,000 for the single-acre, former barroom site with its adjacent, dilapidated apartment house, both of which were demolished within a year of being bought.
 "We paid a premium price for the bar and the rundown apartment house," he said.
 Karam and BayCoast Bank are also partners in the ongoing transformation of the former Adams House nursing home on Highland Avenue into 34 market-rate apartments. Karam previously put the price tag for that project at $12 million.
 He said although all the Davol Street apartments will be listed as market- rate, at least "some of them" will be set aside as less expensive "workforce housing," which uses a formula based on one's earned income that falls short of an "area median income," or AMI for short.
 There will be a total of 69 parking spaces on premises, including three reserved for handicap parking.
 Karam says the MassDOT Route 79 and Davol Street improvement project includes the creation of two pedestrian walkways with traffic lights allowing people to safely walk back and forth to the city's waterfront district.
 One of those walkways, he said, will be situated almost directly across from his 697 Davol St. building, which will sit at the corner of the short, lower portion of Turner Street and Davol Street.
 "That's exactly why we bought it (three years ago). We were thinking ahead," Karam said.
 It just so happens that the new Fall River Depot train station at 825 Davol St. near Pearce Street will be only a short walk for anyone living in Karam's apartment building.
 The redesign of Route 79/138 and Davol Street, according to MassDOT, will "open up land opportunities for economic development; improve neighborhood connections to the Taunton River waterfront; and provide continuous accommodations for bicyclists and pedestrians."
 DOT says it will also improve the safety of vehicular travel within the corridor. Both local and state police for years have acknowledged that speeding on Route 79 and Davol Street has been a problem.
 Karam said he previously made an unsuccessful bid to buy the Jimmy's Used Tire Service building that sits in between his Davol Street site and both Teknikor Contracting Inc. and the two-year-old Rivervue Professional Building at 775 Davol St.
 He also says he hopes that someone eventually will buy the large, former Mackenzie & Winslow industrial building at 609 Davol St. that the city took by tax title two years ago.
 Construction work at Karam's 697-713 Davol St. site began in earnest this week, according to Dave Sanson, a project supervisor for Seekonk-based D.F. Pray, which has been hired to handle general contracting duties.
 Sanson said his company was also involved in the construction of the Knitting Mills Apartments project inside the Wampanoag Mill building at 69 Alden St. in the Flint, which is the neighborhood where Karam grew up.
 Tenants began moving into those 125 apartments in 2019; Sanson said he expects the Davol Street apartments will be ready for occupancy by early spring.
 Karam says he also plans to build either two separate apartment buildings or one larger, L-shaped apartment building closer to the Taunton River on the west side of Davol Street.
 He says he's purchasing both a multi-family house with a large, separate garage at 47 Hathaway St., as well as an adjacent apartment house at 48 Taylor St. -- the latter of which sits closer to the 14-story Point Gloria Condominiums and is now vacant and partially boarded up.
 Karam said he'll demolish both of them in order to improve the site and make room for the new apartments.
 Unlike the 697 Davol St. mixed-use project, Karam says he's doing this one on his own without the financial assistance of any investors.
 Karam says he prefers building and developing apartments as opposed to condominiums.
 "I'm afraid of condos," he said. "When you get to a certain size you need an on-site manager, and you can't always rely on the condo association to keep it up. With apartments we call the shots so that we can do right by the tenant but also for ourselves."
 Karam gives credit to local developer Anthony Cordeiro, who a decade ago with two partners spent more than $30 million to renovate and redevelop the former Mechanics Mill building at 1082 Davol St. into 103 loft apartments, with professional office and business space on the lower floors.
 "He got the whole thing going," Karam said.

CARVER - The iconic characters at King Richard's Faire this year include Count Dracula, Chuckie, Casper, Michael Myers and Princess Buttercup.
 All movie characters, they will appear on the big screen in October on the grounds of King Richard's Fair thanks to Moonrise Cinemas owners Tito Fleetwood and Emily Ladd of Pembroke and Cavan Meese and Saturn Roblee of Vermont.
 Movies will be featured at dusk every Thursday through Sunday in October, opening with "Clue" Oct 1 and "Halloween" on Oct. 31.
 With this year's Renaissance festival canceled due to the coronavirus, the two couples reached out to King Richard's Faire with their drive-up movie theater concept they originated in Vermont. It was an idea conceived in June as a safe way to gather as a community, Fleetwood said.
 The partners have a theater arts background, and with opportunities in that world drying up due to all the COVID-related restrictions, they not only found a way to help themselves but to also pull others up with them, Fleetwood said.
 "It's because we come from the arts that one of our goals, one of our missions is to help other arts organizations that are suffering during this time," he said. "King Richard's Faire is closed down so this is a way to help them generate some revenue."
 He said by partnering with King Richard's Faire in Massachusetts and the three venues they partnered with in Vermont that were otherwise closed down, they are providing them with an alternate source of income. They signed a lease agreement.
 "We're trying to make the best out of a bad situation," he said. "Our industry suffered, and we want to help other organizations weather the storm."
 Tickets can be purchased online at www.MoonriseCinemas.com using a QR code or through limited gate sales. One car pass good for up to six people costs $30 plus a $1.98 fee. Audio is broadcast via FM transmitter. Gates open at 6 p.m. for shows at 7 p.m. Parking is first come, first served Oversized vehicles park in a special area to prevent obstructed views.
 The website lists all the rules movie-goers must follow.
 "We'll be in full compliance for drive-ins during phase three," Fleetwood said.
 The Kitchen, the Moonrise Cinemas concession stand, will serve up popcorn, nachos, ice cream and more with approval of a common victualler license by the Select Board. Food is also ordered through the website and then delivered to theater-goers based on the number of their assigned parking spot.
 They have been training new staff, including some King Richard's Faire employees.

Some recent Pennsylvania polls show Trump and Biden in a competitive race, while others have Biden slightly ahead.
 Philadelphia on Tuesday opened the first seven of what is expected to be 17 satellite election offices. The offices are a new creation, deemed to be legal under state law last month by the state Supreme Court in a lawsuit brought by the state Democratic Party.
 Trump campaign employees promptly showed up, insisting they be allowed to go in and observe the activity inside. However, city election officials ‚Äî including a Republican member of a three-member city election board ‚Äî prevented them, although they offered the campaign a tour of the facilities to let them see how they operate.
 Trump referred to that confrontation in Tuesday night's debate with Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden, saying ‚Äúbad things happen in Philadelphia.‚Äù
 The fight could widen. A number of counties, including the state‚Äôs most heavily populated counties, are opening satellite election offices and putting out drop boxes for voters to drop off mail-in ballots.
 Philadelphia is home to one in five registered Democratic voters in Pennsylvania, and its turnout is closely watched in presidential elections.
 In 2016, Trump won Pennsylvania by about 44,000 votes, or less than 1 percentage point. But he lost Philadelphia to Democrat Hillary Clinton by 67 percentage points, or about 475,000 votes, a gap that was slightly smaller than the historic margins produced for Barack Obama.
 It is at least the second lawsuit filed in Pennsylvania by the Trump campaign, in an effort to expand poll watching rights and limit how counties can collect mail-in ballots and which mail-in ballots can be counted.

This would have terrified me before, but now that I‚Äôve been swimming with sharks, I head back to the Zodiac giddy with excitement.

 # Jaguars senior pours it on Broncos
 By Bill Althaus
 bill.althaus@examiner.net
 Although she was wearing a mask, it was evident that Blue Springs South coach Mallori Perry was smiling following a Suburban Big Eight road volleyball win over Lee‚Äôs Summit North Thursday night.
 Her Jaguars had struggled for the past two weeks and needed the 3-2 (25-23, 17-25, 18-25, 25-17, 15-13) victory as they went into the second half of conference play.
 While the Jaguars walked away with the victory, North coach Shelby Hoffman was also smiling, as she celebrated ‚Äúthe little victories‚Äù with her team.
 ‚ÄúThe last time we played them, they won in three sets,‚Äù Hoffman said after the Broncos fell to 2-12 overall and remained winless in conference play at 0-7. ‚ÄúWe looked like a different team, a much better team, and I think we‚Äôre going to keep getting better as the season goes on,
 ‚ÄúWe were hoping to start the second round of conference with a win, but we got a lot of little victories tonight and they are something we can build on.‚Äù
 When asked about the difference between winning and losing, Hoffman had a two- word answer.
 ‚ÄúAubrey LaPour,‚Äù Hoffman said, of the South senior outside hitter who bashed the Broncos with 23 kills. ‚ÄúIt was a great team effort by South, but Aubrey is one of the most dominating players in the area. We did some things to take her out of their game plan, but she made adjustments and really finished strong.‚Äù
 LaPour had four consecutive kills and an ace to lead the Jaguars to the 15-13 win in the final set.
 ‚ÄúAubrey is amazing on and off the court,‚Äù Perry said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd lost like four or five matches in a row, and she gave the team the most amazing inspirational speech I‚Äôve ever heard. And I think that speech played a big role in our win tonight.‚Äù
 That comment resulted in a huge smile from LaPour.
 ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs so sweet,‚Äù LaPour said. ‚ÄúI listen to a lot of inspirational speakers and I took some notes and wrote an inspirational speech for our team. I practiced in like three hours ‚Äì watching myself in the mirror.
 ‚ÄúI think it had a positive effect on our team and I‚Äôm really happy Coach Perry thought it had an impact. That‚Äôs why I did it. We just needed a boost, and I wanted to give the girls some things to think about.‚Äù
 South‚Äôs Tori Valentine and Tamia McClunie each finished with 12 kills, setter Marti Strickert had 40 assists and four aces and Kylie Gregory finished with nine digs.
 Katie Spacil led the Broncos with eight kills.

For years, electrical-assist pedicabs have been a common sight outside Chicago concerts, sports matches, and other special events. (Unfortunately, however, in 2014, City Council prohibited pedicabbers from operating in the Loop during rush hours, as well as Michigan and State, between Oak and Congress, at all times.) These vehicles have been beneficial to our city, since they replace private car, taxi, and ride-hail trips.

‚ÄúBad things are happening in Philadelphia,‚Äù the campaign‚Äôs lawsuit said. ‚ÄúWhile transparency and accountability are hallmarks of election integrity, the actions of Philadelphia election officials to date have undermined election integrity by shrouding the casting of ballots in secrecy.‚Äù
 The campaign is asking to be able to assign representatives to observe inside satellite election offices that Philadelphia began opening Tuesday around the city to help collect what is expected to be an avalanche of mail-in ballots in the Nov. 3 presidential election.
 But election lawyers, city officials and the state‚Äôs top elections official all say that there is no right under Pennsylvania law, even for a certified poll watcher, to watch people do things like register to vote or fill out a mail-in ballot.
 Those rights, they say, are limited to certified campaign representatives to observe voting at a polling place on Election Day or the opening of absentee and mail-in ballots in an election office.
 A spokesperson for the city's election board chairwoman said Thursday night that he had not reviewed the lawsuit, but the board generally does not comment on litigation. The Trump campaign originally threatened to sue Tuesday night.

EVELETH ‚Äî Beth Bittmann and the Golden Bears volleyball team have their sights set high heading into the new 2020-21 fall season.
 Bittmann believes her athletic team can compete for the section title in this shortened season, which was recently moved back to the fall by the Minnesota State High School League.
 I 100% believe we have the potential to be in the top couple in the section. That‚Äôs our goal.‚Äô‚Äô
 Eveleth-Gilbert just started varsity practice on Monday and are being led by quite a few players that were successful on junior varsity last year and also saw a lot of varsity court time in 2019-20, ‚Äúhopefully to get them prepared for this year.‚Äô‚Äô
 Senior setter Maggie Landwer, senior Ava Thompson, senior middle hitter Afton Roberts and Caydn Krmpotich are leading the way so far for the Bears.
 ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs very agile and quick,‚Äô‚Äô Bittmann said of Landwer. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs kind of our leader out there on the court.‚Äô‚Äô
 For Thompson, ‚Äúshe‚Äôll be seeing a lot net time this year.‚Äô‚Äô
 And ‚ÄúAfton (Roberts) is one of our most athletic players out on the court. She can play front row and she can play a good back row. She probably won‚Äôt step off the court very much,‚Äô‚Äô the coach said. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a quiet leader. She leads by example.‚Äô‚Äô
 Setter Krmpotich will also line up as a utility player for E-G. ‚ÄúSometimes we‚Äôll need her as a setter. Sometimes we‚Äôll use her as a hitter.‚Äô‚Äô
 A number of other players will have prominent roles, as well.
 Junior Joey Westby is ‚Äúgoing to see a lot of playing time. She‚Äôs one of those kids that‚Äôs just naturally athletic. Front row or back row, it doesn‚Äôt matter where you put her,‚Äô‚Äô Bittmann said.
 Junior McKendrick ‚ÄúDeuce‚Äô‚Äô Landwer played libero for the Golden Bears last season. ‚ÄúShe is so quick in that back row. She digs up a lot of hits that most kids would never even think to get their hand on.‚Äô‚Äô With that being said, Bittmann is not sure if ‚ÄúDeuce‚Äô‚Äô will be used as a libero or an all-around player.
 Jennie Krause and Lauren Lautigar both return as juniors, as do Brooke Thyen and Emily Kemp.
 The coach said, ‚ÄúBrooke will see a lot of net time again‚Äô‚Äô due to her athleticism. Kemp, meanwhile, ‚Äúwas probably our strongest middle hitter last year. She was one of the leaders in the conference in kills per game. She is looking really good in practice.‚Äô‚Äô Lautigar was also a sophomore setter last year, and she is being looked to as a leader on the court.
 Setting will definitely be a strong point for the Golden Bears in 2020-21.
 ‚ÄúWe have three very capable setters between Lauren Lautigar, Maggie Landwer and Cadyn Krmpotich and we‚Äôre going to be rotating those three through probably most of the season. Depending on the team that we play will depend on who sets. Cadyn has a little advantage where she can also play front row because she has the height for it.‚Äô‚Äô
 Having three setters isn‚Äôt something teams usually have available to them.
 ‚ÄúHaving three setters that can do the job is a luxury, absolutely. Especially in this time we‚Äôre in with all of the sicknesses going around, if we have a setter out we have two more that can take their place. ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúIt really is a luxury.‚Äô‚Äô
 The coach believes another of her team‚Äôs strengths will be front row attacking.
 ‚ÄúI have girls who are going to be strong on weak side and I have nice hitters on our strong side and I have two very athletic middle hitters. So I‚Äôm really looking forward to a lot of tough net play this year, which we haven‚Äôt always had in the past. I‚Äôm talking all around, not just one or two hitters.‚Äô‚Äô
 Eveleth-Gilbert will continue to be a scrambling team, which includes hitting the floor a lot, according to Bittmann. Her players are regularly getting their knees and elbows bruised up going for volleyballs. ‚ÄúI always say you have to get a hand on the ball.‚Äô‚Äô
 Something the Bears struggled with last season was serving.
 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve really been working on consistent serving. We serve in practice like we would in a game. So if we can keep our serves up and we can keep our mental mistakes down, we‚Äôre going to do some winning this year.‚Äô‚Äô
 The girls are excited to have that opportunity to play for a section title since the MSHSL moved the season back from the spring to the fall.
 ‚ÄúThe girls are really excited to get back into it so they‚Äôve been working hard,‚Äô‚Äô Bittmann said. ‚ÄúOverall the attitude has been really positive and the girls are working very hard.‚Äô‚Äô
 The team has already had to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.
 ‚ÄúWe struggled a little bit already with some girls being quarantined. I know one day we were missing five upperclassmen, so that was a little strange.‚Äô‚Äô At this point, a couple girls have come back and the coach is still waiting on a couple others to return, the coach added.
 The possibility of quarantined players is definitely something that has to be accounted for with E-G opening the season soon.
 ‚ÄúAbsolutely. Our first game is next Thursday at Nashwauk. We‚Äôre just hoping to have all of our girls back and healthy. We have a lot of backup talent as well. We have very athletic girls this year. We do have quite a few that can step in if those girls are still out for any reason.‚Äô‚Äô
