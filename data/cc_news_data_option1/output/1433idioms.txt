 BLACK AND GOLD
 Black and gold. These are the colors of Nauset Regional High School.
 Let us use them in regards to the renovation project.
 The gold is the money it will cost to make NRHS into a safe, respectful and up to date environment for everyone who goes there.
 The black is for people to blame this cost on School Choice students.
 How can a price be found for the education of one student, since there are so many variations involved?
 Amounts and numbers will change depending on what you use and how you use them.
 Reverse the colors. Think of School Choice students as gold. These are students who have a right to attend a school that can better serve their educational needs. They have the support of their families who sacrifice their time and money. For a bright future they are willing to go the extra mile.
 Black is the realization that our communities knew the condition of the regional school from a study made back in 2012 that recognized the expensive nature for repairs and maintenance our schools will need.
 When town halls, police and fire stations, libraries or other municipal buildings needed to be rebuilt or renovated, was a group or a single person singled out for the cost?
 All our towns are working on affordable housing for families and workers. Maybe some will have children. I hope they will.
 Right now seniors are the majority. Things can change. We need to renovate our school now, before we lose the state funding.
 I am a senior citizen. I had children and grandchildren graduate from NRHS. It is not just a school; it is a part of our community. That is why I am asking my fellow seniors to vote yes for these much needed renovations.
 I also want to say thank you to the Nauset students who are helping our seniors during this Covid-19 epidemic.

 CHANGING HABITS
 One might think: Why talk or think about environmental issues now, after all we are in a world crisis with the Covid-19?
 But, it is our natural environment, when healthy, that keeps us healthy. The toxic chemicals that we except in our every day lives can stress our immune systems, and make us vulnerable to disease.
 This week I watched a Frontline documentary on WGBH about the plastics industry and recycling, "The Plastic Wars."
 I encourage everyone, especially those in town government, and voters to watch this documentary and share it.
 As the documentary visually and informatively reveals, recycling was set up by the plastic industry to increase sales and make consumers feel confident about buying more and more plastic, even though plastic is not biodegradable, is a human and environmental health risk, and will be on our planet for hundreds of years to come.
 This certainly does not mean you should stop recycling. What it does mean is that you can be part of the change, by reducing your use of plastic and making change in social, town and national government.
 Let's start with our individual actions. Try to reduce or eliminate plastic use on Earth Day, April 22. After 30 days it may become a habit.

 NO SURPRISE
 I am really kind of amazed that so many people were blindsided by the announcement that there was a need to update Nauset Regional High School.
 Why, it was built in 1984. That was yesterday, right? Only 36 years ago, right?
 Actually, I would be right with you except for the fact that it's not handicap accessible. I had a son who was in a wheelchair and the accessible thing was a real pain in the neck; in fact it was a royal pain in the butt.
 In regard to not letting you know, well, The Cape Codder should be insulted because it only had three or four articles about it in the last few months.
 Did you know that the town is putting in sewers downtown, planning on [a new] tri-town treatment plant and redoing the fire station? So hold onto your wallet, guys. Now that we have that pretty police station everyone else wants a piece of the pie.
 Oh, and read The Cape Codder every week!

Jose Mourinho insists he will not "run away or disappear" from his responsibilities after launching an impassioned defence of his Manchester United tenure.
 The Portuguese has faced severe criticism over his tactics in the wake of United's dismal Champions League last-16 exit to Sevilla on Tuesday.
 Mourinho was particularly panned for the defensive mindset the Red Devils set up with in the 2-1 defeat, as Wissam Ben Yedder's double put the tie beyond United.
 But speaking ahead of United's FA Cup quarter-final with Brighton and Hove Albion on Saturday, Mourinho delivered an emotional 12-minute diatribe in his media conference, fighting back against his critics.
 He said: "Life is good, I have an amazing job to do.
 "Yesterday I met a new person working in the club - different area to me, nothing direct with me - a person that came from another club. I asked 'Why did you decide to come?'
 "He told me 'Because I did a fantastic job in another club and I know that I have a huge job to do so I have a challenge'.
 "I said well done, my decision was based on something similar. I could be in another league where the title is in the pocket, practically won before a ball is kicked.
 "But I'm not there, I'm going to be here. No way are you going to change my mentality. For me, I don't know if you know the expression, there is a quote I like; 'In every wall is a door, every wall is a door'.
 "I'm not going to run away, disappear, cry, because I heard a few boos. I won't disappear from the tunnel running immediately, the next match I'll be first to go out.
 "I respect the fans, I'm not afraid of anything. When I was 20 years old, I was nobody in football, I was someone's son.
 "And now, at 55, I am what I am, I did what I did because of work, because of my talent and my mentality, so they can be together. I understand that for many, many, many years it was really hard for people that don't like me to say 'Here he is again, he wins again'.
 "So, for those months I win nothing, 10 months nothing. Last title I won was 10 months ago. I beat Liverpool, Chelsea, lose to Sevilla - it's their moment to be happy."
 Mourinho delivered a history lesson to the journalists in attendance, pointing out that United have not been in a Champions League final since 2011, while they have reached the quarter-finals of Europe's premier competition just once since that campaign.
 The former Real Madrid boss vehemently defended his own record and insists that the job he is doing at United is a long-term project, which he says is still in its infancy.
 "I say to the fans, fans are fans and fans have the right to opinions and reactions but there is something that I used to call football heritage, what a manager inherits" he commented.
 "The last time Man Utd won the Champions League, which didn't happen a lot of times, was 2011 – or reached the final since 2011.
 "In 2012, out in the group phase - the group was almost same group we had this season, with Benfica, Basel and Galati. Out in group phase.
 "In 2013, out at Old Trafford in the last 16 - I was on the bench [for Real Madrid].
 "In 2014, out in the quarter-finals, 2015 no European football, in 2016 comes back to European football and out in the group phase, goes to Europa League and second knockout stage out of the Europa League.
 "In 2017, play Europa League, win Europa League with me, and go back to the Champions League. 2018 win the group phase with 15 points from possible 18, loses at home in last 16.
 "In seven years, with four managers, once not qualify for Europe, twice out in group phase, and the best was quarter-finals.
 "This is football heritage, and if you want to go to the Premier League, the last victory was 2013 - and in the four consecutive seasons United finish 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th - so in the last four years the best was fourth.
 "This is football heritage, it means when you start the process you are here, you're there or you're there - it is heritage
 "When I arrived in Real Madrid, you know how many players played the quarter- final of the Champions League? Xabi Alonso with Liverpool and Iker Casillas with Real Madrid and Cristiano Ronaldo with Man Utd – all the others not even a quarter-final, that's football heritage."

When Africa's first case of coronavirus was detected in Egypt in February, the rest of the continent prepared for the brunt of a pandemic that has engulfed Europe and spread to the United States, infecting more than 1.6 million worldwide.
 Health experts warned of the devastation the deadly virus could cause in Africa, where most hospitals are desperately short of equipment and trained staff.
 Coronavirus has since spread to 52 African countries, but despite a steady rise in the number of confirmed cases, the continent continues to lag behind the global curve for infections and deaths.
 Still, the World Health Organization last month warned Africa faced a dramatic evolution of the pandemic even as governments imposed restrictions to help curb the spread. The continent appears poorly equipt to manage a major health crisis and is struggling to test enough to monitor virus cases.
 Where does Africa stand?
 To date the novel respiratory disease has infected more than 12,800 people on the continent and killed at least 692, according to a tally compiled by AFP.

Coronavirus Podcast: Down to the wire

Across the world, as doctors suit up to tackle those affected by the coronavirus pandemic, a plethora of younger doctors have been called upon to aid in medical efforts. While the United States has relaxed several of its regulations pertaining to foreign graduate doctors (those who have studied medicine outside of the country), young medicos have found innovative ways to help out. Medical students, whose classes have temporarily been halted, have been staffing call centers, sourcing PPEs and even babysitting for consultants who are on-call.
 For medicos like Shravan, who are just beginning their careers, the pandemic has proven to be a real litmus test, with many questioning how this would shape the rest of their lives.
 “There are doctors who are very senior to us who don’t know much about this disease or its progression. It really makes you look at the knowledge you’ve acquired over these past few years and you are able to realize how little you know,” he says.
 While doctors like Shravan have been forced to face the fire as part of their medical studies, for others, like one young doctor from Chennai, the pandemic came at a time when she was considering leaving medical practice in the country.
 “It was unbelievably hectic. I would have never imagined myself in this position a few months ago when I joined work,” states 25-year-old Dr Swathi*, a junior resident at a private hospital in the city. Just before the outbreak scaled up to a global pandemic, she had been considering moving to Singapore to pursue her postgraduate studies. Her travel plans were postponed due to COVID-19 and she opted to continue working for the time being.
 Swathi has been working in the emergency room of the hospital for the past week, posted there to triage individuals who may have been infected with the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
 When a suspected COVID-19 affected individual is brought to the hospital, they are taken to the separate casualty ward demarcated for such cases. Here is where Swathi steps in and assesses them.
 “Every patient has to be viewed as though they are positive for the virus. We have to do this so that there is less chance of the infection being transmitted to us. Of course, we are still at risk of being exposed to the disease,” she points out.
 After a week-long shift, she has been told to self-quarantine for one week. She has also been started on hydroxychloroquine as a precautionary measure.
 “I had to get an electrocardiogram done and then had to sit with another physician who told me how to start on the HCQ. He also advised me about the side effects I needed to be aware of. This is not a drug that should be taken unless advised,” she emphasises.
 It is not just patients that doctors have to view under the lens of this disease,  but also anyone they come in contact with is put at risk by association.
 “As part of my profession, I am exposed to hundreds of people everyday who may potentially be carrying the virus, whether it has been detected or not. That not only puts me at risk, but even the people I meet outside of the hospital at risk too,” explains Dr Srinivas, a junior resident in nephrology at a private hospital in Hyderabad. He too has been doing shifts in a COVID-19 isolation ward.
 He and others take extensive precautions when entering the hospital at the start of the day and before leaving after their shift, to ensure that there is as little contamination as possible. After reaching home, he has to take extra care to avoid contact with his family.
 “We have heard so many stories of doctors and nurses and other healthcare workers not just getting sick themselves, but also having gotten their loved ones sick. It’s a risk and it’s one thing that we are faced with on a daily basis,” he adds.
 Despite stringent safety precautions, medical personnel on the frontlines of the emergency continue to put themselves at risk of exposing themselves and their loved ones to the disease.
 “But what happens to us when we aren’t given the most basic of protective gear?” questions one postgraduate student from Eluru’s Alluri Sitarama Raju Academy of Medical Sciences (ASRAMS). At the medical college in Andhra Pradesh, students have alleged that safety precautions are not being taken and that adequate gear is not being provided.
 Doctors who speak out openly about PPE shortage have been suspended or threatened with suspension. On Wednesday, news of the suspension of Dr Sudhakar Rao, an anesthesiologist from Telangana, caused outrage. He was suspended by the Health Department for “spreading false news” that there was a lack of PPE and masks in the hospital.
 The situation is similar not only across the country, but globally as well. Even as doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers are fighting the battle against the disease at great personal risk, many are hopeful.
 “There are some things that we, as teachers, cannot teach our students. There is no course which can prepare them for what they face now. Almost suddenly, they have had a lot of responsibilities thrust upon them. No amount of teaching in a classroom can provide them with the vital lessons they are learning now,” states general physician Dr MKS of a branch of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) in Tamil Nadu.
