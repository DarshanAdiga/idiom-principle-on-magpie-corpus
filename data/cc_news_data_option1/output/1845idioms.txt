E poi i due quotidiani fascio-leghisti, che quando si tratta di fare schifo vanno in tandem, pubblicano due titoli emblematici per capire chi sono quelli di destra: per Vittorio Feltri e Libero “Abbiamo liberato un’islamica”, mentre il Giornale di Alessandro Sallusti parla della volontaria come “Islamica e felice, Silvia l’ingrata”. Feltri, che su Twitter aveva già espresso concetti come “Pagare il riscatto per Silvia significa finanziare i terroristi islamici. Che sono amici della ragazza diventata musulmana. Bella operazione”, spiega in prima pagina il problema vero dell’operazione di liberazione di Silvia. “Si dice che Silvia si decise a partire animata dal desiderio di compiere del bene in favore dei bambini di pelle scura.

None of this means that conservatives should go down the Jacob Wohl–Jack Burkman road of attempting to fabricate sexual-assault accusations against high-profile political opponents. Blatantly bad-faith smears should be treated as such. But conservatives had nothing to do with injecting Tara Reade into the public debate. Even if you are deeply skeptical of her evidence, it is clear that she is a Democrat and former Biden staffer, and that she has been telling people at least some version of this story for nearly three decades. That is more than enough to make this fair game for debate and a fair case study in how we evaluate such claims with appropriate rigor.
