Holding his phone up higher Griffin says, "I just had a daughter born two days ago so just have this on Live."
 "It's live?" the officer asks. On the officer's bodycam video, he says, "Do you mind setting it down here?" pointing to the ground.
 Griffin then attempts to put his phone on the ground when the officer interrupts him and says he'll put it on the ground for him.
 "For now I'm going to detain you. But you're not under arrest -- I'm detaining you right now because you fit the description," the officer is heard saying on body camera footage.
 Several police sirens are heard approaching in the background as Griffin is handcuffed and then seen looking down at his phone on the ground repeatedly saying, "If something happens to me, you all better raise hell."
 "By the way, I'm live too, I even got a recording," the detaining officer says.
 Griffin was eventually released once officers cleared him of any involvement in the crime. Police ultimately determined that Griffin was detained in error and the real burglary suspect was later identified and arrested. But VSO says this case may yet yield a positive outcome.
 "We knew we were going to get beat up, criticized, a bit because there were several officers there. It never looks good. But then I was shown the body camera video," Sheriff Mike Chitwood told CNN. "I watched the video. Mr. Griffin was great with my deputies. And my deputies were extremely professional. I called each and every one of them to thank them for their professionalism. I called Mr. Griffin, too, and thanked him for how he handled the situation. When you get stopped by police this is how to act. This really is a teachable moment. We can learn from each other."
 "I learned that Mr. Griffin was a former military police officer. I asked if he would come in and do trainings with our entire staff. He was surprised about it and agreed. Due to Covid-19 we can only train 20 people at a time. We will start trainings early October and keep doing it," Sheriff Chitwood added. "I also offered him a job. We have 40 openings now. But he declined that offer saying he had a job in healthcare."
 No stranger to policing amid controversial race relations issues, Sheriff Chitwood has participated in several roundtables, discussions and meetings in attempt to ease and racial tensions in Volusia County.
 CNN made several attempts to reach Griffin, but was unable to make contact.

“I played as a striker for Haverhill Rovers and then played on the left wing for Saffron Walden Town (from December last season).
 “Now I will be playing on the left wing for Felixstowe. I actually played one friendly at the start of pre-season (5-1 win at Newmarket) but got injured for a few weeks, and only came back last weekend.
 “I think Felixstowe had been trying to get my number for two months during the lockdown,” added Tyger.
 Like his brother Mydas, attacker Tyger - he turns 18 on September 18 - was on the youth team books of Tottenham during his younger days, although both brothers are now determined to make the professional grade by playing as much men’s football as possible, rather than going via the Academy route. Their younger brother Magic is also a talented footballer.
 Tyger continued: “I had a trial with Arsenal, training with the under-23s for five days and also the first team. That went well.
 “Several of their under-23s were injured at the time. I was supposed to play in some matches as well, but then everything got shut down with Covid-19.
 “In my opinion, it’s better to play men’s football, where you will learn more, rather than just playing for the under-23s.
 “That should stand me in good stead for the future, playing in more physical games.
 “I also went to Italy in the last February half-term, to train with a Serie A club (S.P.A.L.), but the doctor got something wrong with my medical, so instead of being cleared to start training on Monday, I couldn’t start until Thursday, which left me just two days, and they had a game on the Saturday as well, so Friday was only light training.
 “Now I want to do well for Felixstowe, starting in the FA Cup. and perhaps score like my brother.
 “I was at Impington College last academic year, but I am being home-schooled this term so that if other football opportunities come my way, then I will be in a position to take them,” added Tyger.
 Felixstowe & Walton United begin their new season with a trip to Hashtag United on Sunday, for an FA Cup preliminary round tie. They begin their Isthmian League North campaign with a trip to Great Wakering Rovers on Saturday week.

We learned to work remotely. We learned to navigate the morass of government and financial bureaucracy to apply for grants, loans and unemployment. We innovated, experimented with side hustles and “Plan B” careers. And many who are taking the initiative to find ways to reach out to assist those most in need with food programs and more.
 In 2020, with an insidious virus raging, we codified a new class of worker -- one that was largely taken for granted in the past: the “essentials.”
 On this Labor Day, let’s offer them our thanks. Their “essential” status meant they risked their health to provide critical services for their neighbors and the community.
 They are the frontline emergency responders -- such as police, fire, and public works employees – who ensure all of us are safe and receiving vital services like water, electricity and garbage pickup.
 They are the health care providers --doctors, nurses and medical technicians – who, by doing their jobs and providing care for the sick, put their own lives at risk of infection. As of mid-August, more than 900 medical professionals in the US have lost their lives in the fight against the virus.
 They are the shopkeepers, grocery store clerks and teachers who provide critical services for our community.
 Of course, all familial breadwinners are “essential” too. Those lucky to have kept their jobs during this crisis have done yeoman’s work, adapting to the “new normal” of remote work and more restrictive workplace interactions. They do what’s necessary to provide for their families.
