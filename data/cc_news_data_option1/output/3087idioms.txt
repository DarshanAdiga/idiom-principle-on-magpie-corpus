Mesa County School District 51 reportedly conducted 1,197 screeners during the school year, nearly twice as many as the previous year. Screeners are completed when there is concern about a student and a teacher, classmate, parents, or sometimes even the student themselves will make a referral to a trained staff member to complete a screener. Suicide risk screeners determine the level of intervention required. Approximately 42% of reports made were from staff reporting the need for the student to be screened.
 A quarter of the reports were self-reported with another 16% from other students.
 Eighth graders had the highest rate of screeners conducted, according to the report.
 The top risk factors among students that were screened included family problems, schoolwork, conflicts and isolation with family support considered the best protective factor for students.

When Kendall did a ballet-themed shoot for _Vogue España_, all hell broke loose because many professional ballerinas felt it was a slap in the face. “It’s so funny that people are getting pregnant and married — or having crazy drama — but my drama is ballerinas being upset at me!” the model fired back. “With my _Vogue Spain_ shoot, I didn’t even know I was going to be a ballerina until I went into hair and makeup.”

Kendall was also slammed for helping to promote the ill-fated Fyre Festival. The model was reportedly given a whopping $250,000 paycheck for the failure. “The rich millennials who went to the festival are all back home in their penthouses and at their high paying jobs,” a source told _In Touch_ in January 2019. “No one is saying Kendall has to give the $250,000 back, but she needs to do the right thing and help the victims that were really taken advantage of. She got paid, but there’s an entire community of Bahamians that are still waiting for their paychecks.” In June, she agreed to a $90,000 settlement to put the festival behind her.

Len M. Hodges, III, 63, loving husband, caring stepfather, devoted grandfather and brilliant businessman passed away July 30, 2020. Born June 22, 1957 in Baytown, TX, Len was raised at the Methodist Children's Home in Waco.      Len met Sybil, the love of his life, when he was just 24 years old. They married in early 1984 and started what anyone would call a true love story. Len & Sybil were inseparable. They enjoyed each other's company so much that they spent every day together. Not only were they husband and wife, they were best friends and business partners. Together, they were a force in all their endeavors, especially real estate. Len was the expert in residential and commercial land transactions, a talent that earned him the nickname the "Land Man." His business proficiency and work ethic allowed their businesses to be incredibly successful.      His business expertise paled in comparison to his role as a grandfather. For more than 35 years, he went by PawPaw and gave unconditional love to his granddaughters. He loved spending time with them and took them on nearly every vacation with him and Sybil because he believed life was better with them around. He made such an impact in his grandchildren's lives that he walked two of them down the aisle at their weddings. Len never missed an opportunity to tell his "grandbabies" how much he loved them, and they never missed the opportunity to say it back.      Len could typically be found fishing, doing yard work, or enjoying the slot machines in Biloxi, MS. He enjoyed camping, especially at Huntsville and Garner State Parks. He loved to snorkel and hunt for treasure in the Frio River. Always the kid at heart, he loved to play games, light fireworks, and shoot water guns.      He is proceeded in death by his mother and father in law, Cora and Leonard Tinkle, sister in law Adele Bruns, and granddaughter, Victoria Rull. He is survived by his wife of 36 years, Sybil, son, Ernest Mitchell and wife Dawn, step-daughter, Susie Allen and husband Kurt, granddaughters, Rachel Arnold and husband Chris, Elaine Behler and husband Zachary, and Madelyne Long, brother Elton Hodges and wife Carla, siblings Kathy Sailer, Ann Robinson and Ronald Simpson, and great-grandchildren Riley, Zayn, Nolen and Carsen.      Due to the coronavirus pandemic, funeral services will be scheduled at a later date. If desired, those wishing to honor Len can become a much needed blood donor or add their names to the National Bone Marrow Registry at www.bethematch.com.

Bass is hardly the only Democrat to be hit with the charge. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., earlier this year came under fire for a television interview in which he lauded Castro for a literacy program and asserted that it was "unfair to simply say everything is bad" in Cuba. Sanders lost Florida by nearly 40 percentage points in the presidential preference primary in March, with Biden garnering 62% of the vote.
