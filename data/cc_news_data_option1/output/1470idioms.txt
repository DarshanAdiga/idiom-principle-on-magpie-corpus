A collaboration between Pueblo Community College and Parkview Medical Center has provided critical personal protection equipment to Parkview's frontline workers in the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 In early April, Jeremy Couch, Parkview's EMS coordinator, contacted Joey Mathews, director of PCC's STEM program, with a request for help.
   
 Namely, 200 headbands, the device that connects and holds in place the protective plastic face shields worn by medical staff.
   
 The headbands are made of polylactic acid, a thermoplastic from renewable resources. Using one of the 3-D printers in PCC's STEM Center, Mathews created a prototype.
   
 After giving the green light to the prototype, Couch ordered the filament through Amazon, with the order paid for by Parkview.
   
 "Each band takes nearly 90 minutes to create," Mathews explained.
   
 Using six printers running at capacity, Mathews -- who did the printing on her own as PCC is educating students remotely -- was able to print about 30 headbands a day, which then were collected by Couch for delivery to the Pueblo Kiwanis Club, of which he is a member.
   
 It was the responsibility of club members to attach the bands to the shields.
   
 "I am so excited to be able to help the community during this desperate time," said Mathews. "PCC and Parkview have always had a great relationship and have helped each other in the past, so it's great to keep this relationship going and help out when things are needed.
   
 "We always want to be here for the community."
   
 The face shields were put to immediate use by doctors, nurses and other front- line staff, with the whole of the 200 headbands delivered by Monday.
   
 "This is an incredible asset to our frontline staff at Parkview," said communications specialist Racheal Morris. "Our men and women are working tirelessly for our community. We are so thankful for the support of PCC to provide our staff protection and comfort against COVID-19."

An additional 1,346 Connecticut residents tested positive for COVID-19 on Monday, bringing the total statewide to 13,381, with 1,760 still hospitalized, a net increase of 106 from Sunday.
 There have been a total of 602 fatalities related to the virus in Connecticut, with 48 more deaths reported Monday.
 Lamont noted that increase in cases is due to an increase in testing, which increased by more than 3,000 from Sunday.
 Considering different parts of the country and of Connecticut are seeing different infection rates, various methods could be used to determine where restrictions can be eased depending on where the virus is spreading the most, Lamont said.
 One way to begin to reopen the economy could be to test those in counties with a lower infection rate, such as Tolland County, and keep those who have tested positive quarantined.
 In higher infection areas, such as Fairfield County, antibody testing could be used to get people who have an immunity to the virus back to work first, Lamont said.
 “An economic recovery only occurs on the back of a complete health care recovery,” New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said.
 “It’s not either/or; it has to be both,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said.
 However, each county or state’s infection rates won’t be the only deciding factor, as Lamont noted some countries that have removed restrictions too soon saw an uptick in the spread of COVID-19.
 “There’s no one-size-fits-all even within the state of Connecticut,” he said. “One thing that’s undeniable is that this virus does not stop at the border of any county, state, or country, but the impact is the same when it comes to our respective economies and health care systems. Working as a regional coalition to make the right decisions will lead to the best public health results for all of our residents. We must solve this problem together.”
 “The reality is this virus doesn’t care about state borders and our response shouldn’t either,” Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo said.

“(But) we’re shorthanded. It will just be my husband and I (as the only adults), and we will be sailing around the clock, non-stop, taking 3-4 hour shifts. When we sailed south in 2018, there were three adults on board. An extra adult makes a huge difference in how much sleep we each get, and in an emergency, it would allow us to have an adult for the children, while having two adults for the boat.

Pearce's path to glory came in the summer of 2018 when Toronto traded him to Boston for a minor league infielder. He played 50 games for the Red Sox in the regular season and reached base in each of his 12 postseason games.
 In the World Series, he went 4 for 12 with three homers, drove in eight runs and scored five. The performance helped Pearce earn a one-year contract worth $6.25 million.
 "Baseball's a funny game," he said when presented with the MVP award at Dodger Stadium. "The longer you stay in the game, great things can happen."
 "You never know where the game will take you," he said. "And I've gone through a lot in my life or in my career to be here, and I couldn't be more thankful."
 Pearce also dismissed allegations the Red Sox used video to improperly steal catchers' signs in 2018. Major League Baseball has been investigating the situation.
 "No. That's such a joke to us," Pearce said on WEEI.
 "We won it fair and square. Whatever they accused us of, we were all kind of like, 'I can't believe this is even an issue.' Once the report comes out we're all going to be free."
 Pearce told the station he recently made one key purchase -- season tickets to see Tom Brady play for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Bucs' stadium is near Pearce's home in Florida.
 "I've been a huge Pats fan pretty much my whole life so I got to watch Tom Brady come in there and take the franchise and do it for 20 years," Pearce said.
 "As much as I love the Patriots, I love Tom Brady, too, and when he gets to come down to Tampa I'm looking forward to watching him play," he said. "It was a no-brainer for me to get those tickets."

I remember being 11 years old and at the food court in Sherway Gardens. In the back corner, there was an arcade for some reason. I guess the logic was that you could dump your kids off to play _Revolution X_ for 20 minutes while you ate your J. Kwinter hot dog or Druxy’s sandwich in peace. Anyway, I wandered off to the arcade while my parents were dining on something and there it was – this two-on-two basketball game where people were capable of hitting ridiculous somersaulting dunks or insane threes from half-court. These men were spitting in the face of the laws of physics. If you hit three shots in a row, your ball would literally catch fire. The announcer was great. Wait, did he just say “Boomshakalaka”? Holy hell, you could even shatter the backboard. And it had an NBA license! Midway’s prior title _Arch Rivals_ , also a two-on- two basketball game released a couple of years earlier, was fun, but this was perfection.

In South Windsor, Sgt. Mark Cleverdon said there were “minor road closures” in town due to downed trees and wires. There were barricades temporarily in place at Strong Road and Main Street, Miller and Abbe roads, and Miller Road and Foster Street extension.
 Additionally, there were both trees and wires down at 259 Lawrence Road. At 1216 Main St, cable wires were down. Fallen wires were also reported at 118 Orchard Hill Drive and 620 Governor’s Highway. Ferry Lane and Main Street was also closed off, due to primarily to downed wires.
 In Vernon, Town Administrator Michael Purcaro said Monday afternoon that there were “widespread” instances of downed trees and wires in town.
 Several roads, including Hatch Hill Road, Mary Lane, and Pine View Drive had closures due to the damage.
 In Stafford, Devin Cowperthwaite, public works director, said that Delphi Road and East Street had to be closed due to downed trees and wires.
 The building inspector responded to the scene of a downed tree that struck a house on West Stafford Road, but no additional information was available.
 In East Hartford a tree fell and struck a home on Mallard Drive, but there were no injuries reported and nobody was believed to be home at the time, police said today.
 Lt. Joshua Litwin said police assisted the fire department after a call was issued by a neighbor shortly after 11:30 a.m. Monday that a tree fell on the house at 157 Mallard Drive. The town building department also responded to the scene, he said.
 In Enfield, the Police Department stated on its Facebook page that downed trees and wires during the storm prompted the closure of Moody Road -- in Somers, the road is called George Wood Road -- at the Enfield/Somers town line, which Lt. Willie Pedemonti said was still closed as of this morning.
 Pedemonti said a tree fell, taking down power lines and impacting two cars, one of which was his cruiser. Pedemonti said he was driving west on Moody Road when suddenly he saw a tree falling toward him.
 "It landed in front of my car, bounced over my car, and landed on another car that was going in the opposite direction," he said.
 Pedemonti and the operator of the other car had to wait in their vehicles for around an hour until Eversource crews arrived to shut off the power.
 Both Pedemonti and the operator were uninjured.
 In addition, the area of George Washington and Betty roads was closed due to a downed tree, the department stated in a later post.
 Pedemonti said the road was blocked off for a few hours but has since reopened.
