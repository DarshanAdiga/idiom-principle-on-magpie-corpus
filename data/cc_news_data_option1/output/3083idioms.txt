"Our fisheries operate under a unique structure and have faced distinct challenges throughout this pandemic. That's exactly why we created the Fish Harvester Benefit and Grant Program- to meet those needs head-on," said Bernadette Jordan, Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard. We've been working around the clock to develop a simple, accessible system to deliver over $469 million to Canada's fish harvesters as smoothly and quickly as possible. That's why it was important for us to announce this in advance of August 24, to ensure applicants have time to prepare."

Beers produced by the So Many Roads brewery will be named after the Bianchi brothers' various ventures through the years.
 "It's going to be a venue: two sides, two stages, a brewing taste room," explains Bishop. "I'm going to put a pizza place in there. It's going to be my own. I do have pizza experience. I'm going to do a brick oven, traditional Neapolitan, good, fresh ingredients. I'm going to do fresh pastas as well. Kind of basics. I want people to come there for the food and the music."
 What kind of music? Jam bands, of course, and reggae...and maybe a little EDM, Bishop says.
 The name of the new joint, So Many Roads, is a nod to the often turbulent journey of the Bianchis, as they ran clubs ranging from Cervantes' Masterpiece Ballroom, which the brothers sold in 2009, to several versions of Quixote's True Blue, Owlsey's Crazy Diamond and Owlsey's Golden Road, among others.
 "There were so many locations and so many different things that happened," Bianchi recalls.

Sinclair’s losing candidacy was nonetheless influential in New Deal policies and it helped rejuvenate the Democratic Party in a state where “as late as 1931,” historian James Gregory has written, “not a single Democrat held statewide office.”
 In 1938, Culbert Olson — elected to the state senate as an EPIC candidate — defeated Merriam to become the state’s first Democratic governor since 1894. EPIC didn’t usher in a progressive groundswell, but it did help set in motion the push and pull between left and right that gives even centrist politics in California today a progressive bent.
 It’s not a stretch to argue that Sinclair’s campaign, and perhaps especially the promise of full employment or $50 a month, helped bring to the mainstream what would later emerge as the state’s encompassing (if still to be perfected) social safety net — affordable quality higher education, equal opportunity legislation and a version of collective healthcare.
 Ting’s plan echoes Sinclair’s ideals and EPIC’s brash call for active governing. Since Congress passed its first coronavirus stimulus in March, states have already been borrowing from the feds to cover the $600 unemployment increase. Ting’s innovation merely extends that, with no need of Congress’s specific cooperation. Sinclair would admire the moxie.

Yankees hitters also heard their walk-up music when they came to the plate.
 The Phillies played just their fifth game of the season and second after being forced to wait seven days following a COVID-19 outbreak among the Marlins that started opening weekend in Philadelphia.
 Yankees lefty J.A. Happ (0-1) gave up four runs on three hits and six walks in three innings in his first career loss vs. the Phillies. Happ entered 5-0 with a 1.45 ERA against his former team.
 Even though fans aren’t permitted in the ballpark, they made plenty of noise from the streets. Someone rang a cowbell and another person played the drums on and off for a few innings, including nonstop for several minutes in the fifth inning.
 After Brett Gardner lined a two-run homer to right on an 0-2 pitch in the second to give the Yankees a 3-0 lead, Happ lost control in the third.
 Happ walked Andrew McCutchen and Harper hit a two-run shot on an 0-2 pitch one out later. Happ then walked Realmuto, allowed a bloop single to Jean Segura and walked Scott Kingery. He walked Phil Gosselin to force in a run and Roman Quinn’s grounder drove in another run to give the Phillies a 4-3 lead.

This is not actor James D'Arcy's first encounter with writing and directing a film. He had that experience a few years ago with an oddball comic short titled "Chicken/Egg," which starred Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, then in his sixth season as Jamie Lannister on "Game of Thrones" (the short is currently available on YouTube). D'Arcy, making his name as a quiet, but dashing screen presence since the late-1990s, had been writing feature scripts for years, and came close to directing one of them, but "Made in Italy" was the first to have all of its pieces fall into place.      And his feature debut behind the camera is a rarity - a sweet and funny and charming and very positive movie that's not filled with cliches. His story teeters close to the edge of a couple of them, but never falls into the abyss.      With a small cast of mostly likable characters, and a scattering of good-for- nothings to make the nice folks look even better, D'Arcy's story introduces Jack (Micheal Richardson), the manager of a London art gallery, and his soon- to-be ex-wife Ruth (Yolanda Kettle) - one of the nasty characters - whose family owns the gallery and is now selling it, leaving Jack out in the cold.      What's a gallery manager who is going through a messy divorce, has no other career skills, has been sad and lost since his mother died in an accident when he was 7, and has no relationship, beyond an estranged one, with his aloof father, to do?      Well, look up dad, take a drive with him to their abandoned old family home in gorgeous Tuscany, sell the place, and have enough money to buy the gallery from his wife's family, of course!      You might wonder if the uncomfortable presence between the father and the son will somehow work out, or if the bitterness emanating from the son's bad marriage will lead to some kind of happiness for him, or if the mission to Italy will result in dreams coming true back home. Those are common and expected story arcs in small, arty films like this.      But "Made in Italy" depends as much on characters and their development as it does in the stories going on around them. It was a spot-on decision to have son Jack and father Robert be played by real-life son and father Micheal Richardson and Liam Neeson. It's not that there's that much of a physical similarity, but it clearly comes across that these two men know and understand each other, and everything clicks when they step into character, even when their roles call for two people who do not know each other very well. That's called good acting.      Their arrival in the little Tuscan village where the house has been empty for 20 years signals that it's time to introduce some comedy - Richardson proves to be adept at pratfalls - and some other characters - it's not long before we meet beautiful restaurant owner Natalia (Valeria Bilello) and business-minded estate agent Kate (Lindsay Duncan), along with a few assorted and rather colorful local characters.      In short order, the plotlines kick in: Do we fix up this dust heap or do we sell it as is? Or do we keep it? Arguments between father and son on those topics ensue. Is Jack getting a little crush on Natalia, even though she has a daughter with her and an ex-husband nearby? Can Robert, once a well-known painter who walked away from it all, ever come back to the limelight?      And then the father-son problems are plopped down in the middle of it all. Did supposedly carefree Robert abandon Jack when his wife died? Will sullen Jack ever figure out a way to get back with his dad? More important, does he even want to?      Amidst regular doses of drama and goofiness, all played out at a slow, smooth pace, with gentle music pushing it along, "Made in Italy" emerges as a story about unhappy people in a beautiful place, and how they're affected by it. There are misunderstandings and there are squabbles, and there's an enjoyable and impossibly happy ending. And even that doesn't feel like a cliche.      "Made in Italy" opens in select theaters and will be available on most VOD and cable platforms on Aug. 7.      Ed Symkus can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.

“By having the shows at ONEOK Field, we will be able to maintain social distancing in how people will be seated, both in the audience and among the performers,” he said. “The stadium seats about 8,500, and we’re expecting about 1,700 for our concerts, so there should be plenty of room.”
 Masks will be required of all attendees, Elder said.
 Patrons will be in the ballpark’s regular seating, with the orchestra set up on the playing field. Elder said the orchestra is working with one of the top sound engineers in the country to ensure that the orchestra will be heard clearly.
 “The sound of the orchestra is incredibly important to us, and we’re going to make sure it’s the best it can be for these concerts,” Elder said.
 The first concert, described as a “Celebration of Beethoven” in honor of what would have been the composer’s 250th birthday, will be performed Sept. 5 (originally, the orchestra had planned its season-opening concert for Sept. 12 at the Tulsa PAC).
 “We’ve also had to make some changes to the concert itself,” Elder said. “Our original soloist, Garrick Ohlsson, is unable to be with us on that date. Instead, we will be featuring Yefim Bronfman as our guest artist, who will be performing Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 3.”
 Bronfman is one of the most acclaimed pianists on the classical scene today and has performed with renowned symphonies around the world. The Texas Classical Review of Bronfman’s 2019 performance with the Houston Symphony said, “He ... brought sheer visceral impact to the fore, turning chords and flourishes into grand dramatic gestures.”

ST. LOUIS -- St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner, whose job performance has been lauded by some civil rights activists and criticized by President Donald Trump and other leading Republicans, held off a challenge from a former homicide prosecutor in Tuesday's primary election.
   
 Gardner, 44, defeated Mary Pat Carl in the Democratic primary. She'll be heavily favored in November against Republican Daniel Zdrodowski since St. Louis voters are overwhelmingly Democratic.
   
 Gardner has shaken up the St. Louis criminal justice establishment since she was elected in 2016, becoming the city's first Black circuit attorney. She initiated reforms that have included using diversion programs instead of incarceration, stopped prosecuting low-level marijuana crimes and drew the ire of police leaders when she developed an "exclusion list" of officers who can't serve as primary witnesses because of unspecified credibility concerns.
   
 But it was her decision to file charges in two high-profile cases that drew the scorn of conservatives.
   
 In 2018, Gardner charged then-Gov. Eric Greitens, a Republican, with felony invasion of privacy. The charge accused Greitens of taking a compromising photo of a woman during an extramarital affair and threatening to post it if she spoke of their relationship.
   
 Greitens admitted to the affair but denied that he committed a crime. The charge was later dropped. But Greitens, who also was facing unrelated ethics complaints, resigned in June 2018.
   
 Gardner again received national attention last month when she charged a white couple, Mark and Patricia McCloskey, with felony unlawful use of a weapon for displaying guns when protesters marched near their home.
   
 Several hundred demonstrators were marching to the home of Mayor Lyda Krewson on June 28 when they veered onto a private street where the McCloskeys lived. He came out with a semi-automatic rifle and she had a semi-automatic handgun, according to a probable cause statement.
   
 Gardner said the display of weapons during an otherwise peaceful protest risked bloodshed. The McCloskeys said they felt threatened.
   
 Trump was critical of Gardner on Twitter and in interviews. Republican Gov. Mike Parson said he'll likely pardon the couple if they're convicted. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri asked the U.S. Department of Justice to launch an investigation of Gardner. Republican Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt asked a judge to throw out the charges.
   
 St. Louis has one of the nation's highest murder rates, and homicides are up again this year. Critics have accused Gardner of wasting time and money on high-profile cases rather than doing more to put killers behind bars.
   
 Despite the criticism, Gardner has had plenty of support, too. The city's Black community in particular has lauded her reforms and her willingness to take on police, who they believe have, for years, unfairly targeted Black residents.
   
 Gardner has long contended she's the victim of race-based attacks. In January, she filed a federal lawsuit accusing the city government, along with the biggest police union and others of a coordinated and racist conspiracy aimed at forcing her out of office. The lawsuit also accused "entrenched interests" of intentionally impeding her efforts to change racist practices.
   
 Carl, 43, also lost to Gardner in the 2016 Democratic primary. She was the city's lead homicide prosecutor at the time, and continued in that role for the first 10 months of Gardner's tenure before resigning. She had pledged a stronger focus on violent crime.

 “That was the reason why we decided simply to cancel our Symphony in the Park show, which was to be done at the Guthrie Green,” Elder said. “We met with Dr. (Bruce) Dart from the Tulsa Health Department, and we realized it would be impossible to put that show on in a way that would keep both our audience and our musicians safe.
