It didn't stop there though as Finebaum brought up how precipitous the Big Ten's fall from grace has been.

For the third straight year Saturday, Northview High School's girls golf team left its home course of Forest Park with the Western Indiana Conference championship plaque.
 Northview junior Brooklee Bussing earned WIC medalist honors with a 7-over-par 80 that, according to coach Josh Trout, could have been four or five strokes lower if some of her "almost" putts had fallen in the hole.
 "I struggled around the greens a little, but I was able to pull it together for a decent score," Bussing told the Tribune-Star afterward. "I hit the ball from tee to green pretty well. Just the putting and the chipping were a struggle."
 Trout's Knights posted an 18-hole score of 378, 23 shots better than runner-up Greencastle's 401.

Governor Newsom, no doubt hoping to provide some smidgen of good news to the counties, announced in the same breath that the state is now allowing barbershops and hair salons to offer their customers indoor hair care services starting Monday. Otherwise, the dance between the governor’s office and county has been somewhat strained and fraught. Counties have complained of being kept in the dark and poor communication from the governor. County Public Health Director Do-Reynoso said the county was first notified of the proposed changes late Wednesday, but only in the sketchiest details. The final, fuller picture, she said, was not announced until Friday afternoon. On the flip side, the governor has blamed counties for flubbing the first re-opening, complaining that county health officials allowed more businesses to open, relying too much on the attestations of business owners, before they had the testing capacity to adequately monitor the situation, not to mention the ability to track-and- trace.

The Republican use of the White House for purely political events brought me back to a time years ago when I saw firsthand another political strong man use public space for his own political purposes.

Well, that is probably because Johnson knew his team had a depth advantage and the ability to keep players fresh with rotations. His hunch that Fulton may eventually run out of gas proved to be true and it was just a matter of containing sophomore quarterback Courtland Simmons, who made a number of big plays to keep his team within striking distance in the first half.

"In this day and age, that would be something that would be so amazing," Lopez said of potentially becoming the first woman to own a team. "I don’t have anything to report on that end right now. But I think in every field, especially in institutions like Major League Baseball that are so American in this moment in time, it is important for diversity. It is important for women to have positions of power that they’ve earned, and deserve, and can contribute in a way that is just as good as any man on the planet. So of course I am for it."

Mais une fois que la portée complète et sauvage du projet de Jeremy et Nedley est détaillée, des téléspectateurs comme Waverly peuvent se demander: «Qu’est-ce que la grenouille?!»

The Black Lives Matter demonstrations usually target police buildings and federal buildings. Some protesters have called for reductions in police budgets while the city's mayor and some in the Black community have decried the violence, saying it's counterproductive.

"Loved our pace the first 10, 12 minutes," Flyers coach Alain Vigneault said. "I think we were playing the type of game that we wanted to play, and then somehow we just lost it. We stopped being first on the puck, stopped making the plays that we needed to make with the puck and they slowly but surely found momentum."

The Forte5 SX with the 6 speed manual is a blast to drive. The power is readily available at low RPMs. The interior is spacious and fits my 6'7 frame well with plenty of room to spare. I don't even need to have the seat all the way back which is exceptionally rare. The ride is quite comfortable. I'm averaging 31mpg(hand calculated, computer says 32-33) in mixed driving. The power folding mirrors may seem a bit gimmicky at first, but they sure are nice to have in a narrow 2 car garage. It's not quite as quick as a GTI nor does it handle quite as well, however you can buy one of these in SX trim for under $18k with a long warranty to boot. Put a little of that savings into some suspension and power upgrades and you're on par.
