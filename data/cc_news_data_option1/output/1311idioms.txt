As Illinois residents hope for the lifting of a stay at home order and a return to normal, here are some sobering facts to consider on the spread of coronavirus in the state
 The number of people testing positive with the deadly disease tripled in six days last week to 4,596 on Sunday, based on 27,762 tests conducted in Illinois Department of Public Health, commercial and hospital labs across the state. The number of deaths on the week rose to 65, including the first infant death reported in the state.
 Cases have been reported in 47 Illinois counties, based on the latest figures released Sunday by the IDPH. Every region of the state has cases. The nearest counties to Jasper with infections at last report were neighboring Cumberland County and Fayette County a county away to the west.
 As of Monday, COVID-19 cases and deaths had not leveled off in Illinois. That brings into question whether schools, thousands of businesses and services, government agencies, churches and entertainment venues will reopen next week, based on tentative dates reported last week.
 Medical experts with the Center of Disease Control are still trying to convince skeptical Americans on the seriousness of this pandemic that has spread across the globe in recent weeks. One simple fact sticks out: COVID-19 is 10 times more lethal than seasonal flu strains.
 Until the stay at home and closure orders are rescinded, all people of all ages should practice social distancing or staying at least six feet apart from others in public. Cleaning hands, disinfecting bathroom and kitchen counters and other regularly touched surfaces, and sneezing or coughing into a tissue or your arm, all can check the spread of the disease. And most important, if you are sick stay home from work or going out for groceries or other supplies.
 There are ways to help others during this health crisis. Two ways are sewing face masks for hospitals (see related story) or helping with food or medicine pickups for elderly neighbors or those in need - using precautions to not infect them, of course.
 With warmer weather arriving this month, getting outside is great for exercise and unwinding from the at-home requirement. But practice social distancing.

If you look back at the Patriots' roster over the past 20 years, you'd be hard-pressed to find any edge rushers being paid top dollar. The biggest pass rushers off the edge in Patriots history are Willie McGinest, Chris Slade, Mike Vrabel, and Chandler Jones. None of them ever garnered top-shelf contracts when compared to others at their positions.

What stood out to me (again) was the total lack of acknowledgement that a significant portion of Destiny 2 players strongly dislike the direction the game is going as whole. Each new season brings a major stock refresh for Eververse, Bungie's microtransaction store. More and more, any cosmetic worth owning will cost real dollars, which are used to buy Silver, the premium in- game currency. Completing activities in the game itself will often fail to provide interesting cosmetic rewards players enjoyed from past years and the original Destiny. This has led some to feel Bungie only cares about getting them to buy ornaments. This belief is amplified by the fact Season of the Worthy is light on content, and what's there hasn't been particularly well received.

WEST BEND, Wis — Many dairy processing plants across Wisconsin have more products than they can handle and that's forced farmers to begin dumping their milk down the drain.
 That's the case at Golden E Dairy near West Bend. Farmer Ryan Elbe told WISN- TV they are dumping about 30,000 gallons (113,562 liters) a day.

This failure to acknowledge isn't a new thing, either. Players have been talking about how Bungie cares more about Eververse and making content for that microtransaction machine than the core of the game for over a year. You can visit the subreddit any day of any week and see the posts and comments. They started off concerned, transitioned to angry, but have more recently moved to a total lack of faith that Bungie cares and hopelessness that anything will be fixed.

"But [Uber is] providing an opportunity for work for workers that would have no alternative if this didn't exist.

Linking your Bethesda account to your Steam account is great for cross- platform promotions. Bethesda has been known to offer a game on Steam for those that already own it on the Bethesda launcher.

On the positive side of things, which we'll get out of the way quickly, Bungie is looking to improve the way Trials of Osiris rewards work, making the activity worthwhile for both the 1 percent and the 99 percent. They're also continuing to work on banning cheaters and hoping to deploy a fix for the disconnects. Those have gotten so bad I failed to realize I had a real internet connection issue for about a week as it was able to expertly hide among the sea of errors Bungie was tossing at me. The disconnects are so prevalent people are jokingly calling this season the Season of the Beaver, an infamous error code used by Destiny 2.
