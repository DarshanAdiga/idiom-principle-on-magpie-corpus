 ## In Short
 AXGN is in a "prove it to us" phase, where valuations and upward trajectory in revenue volumes have begun to gain speed. We are bullish on the longer-term outlook of the company, and feel that targeted activity from management this year has already begun to come through the income statement, via operating efficiencies and higher sales conversion from the rep headcount. We believe the market may be under-reflecting the upside in operating efficiency in particular, and feel that AXGN shares are worth ~$20 at best right now, with more room to grow as market cap expands in tandem pricing distribution. Add in the fact of the upcoming clinical trial tailwinds for 2021/2022, then we feel that AXGN will continue their walk northward over the coming periods.
 There are downside risks to the valuation and upward trajectory in pricing outcomes that must be factored into the investment debate also. For example, there is a chance that the reduced headcount in the salesforce may translate negatively to the cadence of sales conversion, and this would carry through to the speed of revenue expansion over the coming periods. AXGN is retaining the risk of ensuring that their focus on hyper-training the existing rep base, therefore much is riding on their propensity to drive growth to the top. Additionally, the effects of the pandemic may continue to draw out, as the US and Europe are now continuously seeing a resurgence in cases and the death tolls are rising for both zones drastically. The US has had over 17 million confirmed cases this year, to illustrate, with the highest rate of the same occurring in the last 2 months. This would certainly add more stress to AXGN's end-markets and the overall turnover of procedure volumes. Moreover, the company may face unforeseen setbacks to timeline milestones, that would ultimately be reflected negatively on the charts. Any setbacks in the RECON and REPOSE trials would therefore present as downside risks to our valuation and the upward trajectory in pricing distribution. These risks to the downside scenario should certainly be factored into the investment debate, although we feel the effects would have a small effect to the fair value, but may impact the convergence to the upside in the near to medium term.

Furthermore, clinical milestones are at no standstill and remain unchanged in terms of the timeline. The RECON trial, aiming to transition Avance towards biologics (under the 361 to 351 FDA guidelines) is on schedule, and management expects to complete single-year follow ups on the last patients into 2H 2021, most likely around October. We can expect readouts from preliminary data in early 2022, in anticipation for the BLA filing the following year. The company also completed the last follow-up of the REPOSE trial, which was investigating Axoguard's performance as an intervention in painful neuroma. Analytics are underway for the data collection and findings from the pilot study are expected for readouts in the 1st quarter next year. We firmly believe that AXGN has shown its resilience in pipeline development in the face of wider market challenges this year, adding into the strength of the portfolio mix and the overall utility of the product mix, by expanding labels into adjacent segments within the same markets. Therefore, investors can expect movement in shares on these 2 clinical tailwinds, that may drive pricing distribution northwards should the data hold up.
 Management has been correctly conservative on guidance, although expects Q3 momentum to carry over into Q4, particularly in sales trajectory and clinical momentum. We feel that YoY growth in the 4th quarter is reasonable, and agree with management's sentiment there. We would point to investors the diminishing effects of Covid-19 that may begin to surface as the vaccine rolls out, in addition to the legislative tailwinds that may arise on the back of this, in terms of social distancing/restrictions. We would expect procedure deferrals to normalise towards pre-pandemic levels, albeit in Europe where Covid-related headwinds remain. Consequently management remains conservative on FY2021 revenue volumes at ~$120 million, which represents ~5.3x forward EV/Revenue, hardly a premium at this stage.
 Most of the backlog from earlier periods this year has already been worked through; therefore, we would anticipate a more organic contribution to sequential growth into Q4, and backing Covid-19 out of the equation in the upside case, we see a sequential growth pattern of ~9%, with ~7.5% YoY upside in revenue volumes factoring in additional Covid-19 headwinds for Q4. Our modelling bakes in total volume growth of ~350bps, in line with procedure volume recoveries plus normalisation in demand and patient turnover. Thus, investors should consider the upside potential and reflection on multiples expansion this growth pattern may have on AXGN shares, particularly as we see lagging competitors who remain disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, whilst sharing the same end-market as AXGN. We are aligned with management's guidance, and estimate ~$122 million at the top for FY2021, with a growth pattern of CAGR 18% by 2025 at the same level. We see profitability at EBITDA levels by 2023, and believe the carry through to FCF will remain substantial enough until positivity in this level by 2026 onwards. Gross margins have been healthy over the past 4 years, and we envision strength to remain here as operating efficiencies come through the income statement.

Given the improvements in productivity and cash conversion realised this year, this aligns with the growth narratives in each addressable market size, excluding uncertainties associated with trauma incidence. Last year, the peripheral nerve repair market was sized at ~$135 million, and is forecast for CAGR at ~21% into 2026, reaching a total market size of ~$515 million by that period. This ties in with global nerve repair and regeneration market projections, which are estimated for growth of CAGR ~9% to reach $9.7 billion by 2025; therefore the actual peripheral segment may widen greater than the forecasts mentioned above. As commercial movements begin to normalise for AXGN given the eventual slowdown of Covid-19, the company has maintained priority on surgeon support, and we feel they will benefit from the widening of the peripheral nerve repair market, in line with growth figures of the same. To illustrate, the company exited the 3rd quarter with YoY growth of 11% in active accounts, now holding 875 accounts. Around 35% of sales is exposed to the upper decile of accounts, and therefore management is keen to drive further penetration in these channels and driving growth at the top via this route. Management also remains confident that the current headcount of the salesforce is sufficient to fuel the growth vision, and the direct sales channel was supplemented by 20 independent agencies this recent quarter. As such, the company has remained focused on limiting headcount expansion prioritising ongoing training of the existing rep base.
 ## Additional Inflection Points For Consideration
 We feel that sales will continue along the current YoY trajectory of 5-8%, in line with the growth of the wider peripheral nerve repair market. To converge to the upside case, AXGN needs to continue the sales execution observed in inventory turnover and the operating cycle listed above, whilst increasing sales conversion from the priority on the existing rep headcount. We are backing the company to do this, given the affirmative liquidity action taken by management this year, and the upside that has been reflected on the charts resultant of. Notwithstanding the improved performance of the salesforce this year vs. 2018/2019 in tandem with the Covid-related pressures experienced by the wider market. We feel that investors may not have fully priced in the operating efficiencies and guidance for Q4 and FY2020, and believe that the company will continue to see upside based on sales performance over the back end of 2H 2020. Given this, Q4 and FY2020 performance are key catalysts for inflection that investors must consider in the investment debate.

Dec 21 (Reuters) - Tottenham Hotspur manager Jose Mourinho questioned the attitude of some of his players following Sunday's 2-0 home defeat by Leicester City in the Premier League.
 The visitors were awarded a penalty in first-half stoppage time after defender Serge Aurier clattered into Wesley Fofana, and Jamie Vardy converted from the spot.
 An own goal from Spurs' Toby Alderweireld in the second half sealed the win for Brendan Rodgers' side.
 Mourinho said Aurier should have been more aware of the situation but did not blame the defeat on his reckless challenge.
 "I would describe it as a mistake," Mourinho told Sky Sports. "You have to know where you are and know that you are inside the box and the player is going away from your goal without any kind of danger.
 "Serge was phenomenal against Liverpool, probably our best player but today he made this mistake. Did this mistake cost us the three points? I think it is unfair to say that."
 Mourinho said that while it was unfair to point the finger at Aurier there were others in the team who did not show the right attitude.
 "If I have to talk about individuals, I could go in other directions where the attitude was not the attitude that I like," he added.
 The defeat saw Spurs drop to fifth on 25 points, six adrift of leaders Liverpool. They next face Stoke City in the League Cup on Wednesday. (Reporting by Arvind Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Rutherford )

MADRID, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Talking points from the weekend in Spanish football.
 LA LIGA MINNOWS RESIST PEREZ'S SUPER LEAGUE PUSH
 Real Madrid President Florentino Perez caused a stir by saying proposed reforms to competitions such as a European Super League "cannot wait", but Real's end-to-end match with Eibar showed the enduring value of national leagues.
 Madrid left with a 3-1 win but minnows Eibar went toe-to-toe with the champions and could have earned a draw had they not been so wasteful.
 "The match in Eibar showed the value of national leagues against the opulence of a Super League," said newspaper Marca.
 "Let's hope they never rob us of games like this, which speak so well of our football and our league."
 MADRID TURN ON THE STYLE BUT STILL LOOK VULNERABLE
 Real Madrid are on a roll after winning five games on the spin and are starting to look a lot like the consistent side that swept to last year's title.
 Their win over Eibar showcased their best moments of the season, with virtuoso displays from Luka Modric and Karim Benzema, but the performance was also riddled with individual errors.
 One mistake which could have proved costly came from captain Sergio Ramos, who gifted the ball to Eibar's Takashi Inui by his own area and then committed what looked to be a handball but escaped punishment.
 POOR DEFENCE UNDERMINING BARCA TITLE BID
 Just when it looked like they may turning a corner after their statement win over Real Sociedad, Barcelona showed how far they still have to go with Saturday's 2-2 draw at home to Valencia.
 Barca have yet to string three successive league wins together and they trail leaders Atletico Madrid by eight points while playing a game more.
 Coach Ronald Koeman was unhappy with his defence yet again, and despite picking a side containing four players aged 21 or under he criticized the team for not being mature enough.
 COUDET'S CELTA REVOLUTION CONTINUES
 Argentine Eduardo Coudet had no experience of coaching in Europe when he took on a Celta Vigo side in freefall in November when Oscar Garcia was sacked, but he has overseen a dramatic transformation in little more than a month in charge.
 His side eased to a 2-0 win over Alaves on Saturday to record a fourth consecutive victory in five league games in charge, turning his side from relegation candidates to contenders for the European places.
 SOCIEDAD'S EARLY PROMISE FIZZLES OUT
 Real Sociedad looked like dark horses for the title after an excellent start to the season but the fragility of their squad has been shown up by a run of eight games without a win in all competitions, including Saturday's 2-1 defeat at struggling Levante.
 Coach Imanol Alguacil told worried fans to keep believing, but unless they can bounce back in Tuesday's showdown at home to leaders Atletico Madrid they will be written off altogether. (Reporting by Richard Martin; Editing by Peter Rutherford )

Q3 Walkthrough Supports Narrative In Operating Efficiency and Addressable Market Growth
 Q3 financials came in well above consensus and provided evidence of a good runway for growth into the coming periods. The top-line came in strong at ~$33 million, exhibiting ~17% upside YoY. Much of the sequential growth pattern in Q3 was defined by a pull-through of procedure deferrals, which had benefitted from a recovery in volumes, and contributed ~10% of total sales for the quarter. Organic growth therefore is contained to ~6% YoY, still impressive considering the inpatient environment YTD and impact of the pandemic on the wider medical devices/appliances end-markets, including implied incidence of trauma cases at the back of this. The company has also engaged in sound cost- targeting and liquidity preservation measures this year, which have been reflected in lower sales rep headcount, and at the productivity plus operating efficiency levels.
 To illustrate, accounts receivable turnover remained relatively flat YoY, whilst days of sales outstanding increased ~9% to 58 days, meaningfully lower than peers across the YTD. Impressively, inventory turnover actually increased ~25% to 1.64x, whilst the days of inventory outstanding reduced by 50 days YoY to 223 days, again well ahead of competitors this year amidst the current pandemic-induced environment. The company also managed to increase accounts payable turnover by ~20% to 5.28x, reducing the accounts payable turnover days by 13 days to ~69 days. This shows the company's ability to settle transactions and increase the depth of working capital efficiency, being able to pay the bills as it were, to add torque working capital cycle. As such, the cash conversion cycle reduced by ~47 days YoY to 211 days, which carried through to a 50 day reduction to 281 days. Therefore, targeting efficiency measures engaged by management this year have carried through the cash flow statement and into operating efficiencies, and the company has managed to reduce the amount of cash tied up in working capital and increase the conversion rate of inventory to cash. Therefore, we feel the company is well- positioned to continue this trajectory and capture additional market share from competitors, who are lagging in productivity on the back of challenges faced from the pandemic this year.

There was a short-lived expansion into Clemmons from 2005 to 2007, but for the most part Angelo Ballas has focused on his core business, keeping his uncle's vision and his memory alive.
 The menu at Grecian Corner has changed precious little over the years. It still offers a veal cutlet sandwich ($4.50), a once popular item now long forgotten by many other restaurants. The spaghetti a la Venice ($8.95) -- with onions, peppers, mushrooms and mozzarella -- is still a best-seller, though the Greek-style spaghetti with feta ($7.95) has its fans, too. Other Italian items include lasagna ($8.65) chicken veal and eggplant Parmesan ($8.95 each).
 The most popular item on the menu is the chicken souvlaki plate with a Greek salad ($11.80), though for years the restaurant sold only the traditional pork souvlaki. "People bugged my uncle for a long time to add the chicken souvlaki," Angelo Ballas said. "Now it outsells the pork 10 to 1."
 Other Greek items include the gyro ($6.85), moussaka ($8.95) and spanakopita ($5.85). The spanakopita is a relatively recent addition under Angelo Ballas' tenure, as is the popular avgolemono (Greek lemon soup ($4.25).
 Grecian Corner sells quite a few hot dogs (now Nathan's all-beef dogs). Other sandwiches include steak hoagie, BLT, Reuben and hummus pita.
 Just in case none of that appeals to diners, Grecian corner also sells a variety of pizzas, ($9.65 to $13.14 for a 12-inch).
 A couple of newish items include a chicken pesto pita, sweet potato waffle chips and cranberry pecan salad, but most of the food is just as George Ballas envisioned back in the 1970s. "About 90 percent is probably unchanged," Angelo Ballas said.
 Only a few other things have changed over 50 years. The restaurant is quite small -- it opened as a Minnie Pearl fried chicken restaurant in 1969 before the Ballas family took it over. The Ballases managed to squeeze in about 50 seats in the original building, fondly referred to as "cozy."
 In 2013, Angelo Ballas embarked on a major renovation. The bathrooms finally were accessible from inside the restaurant. "That was huge for us," he said. "For 43 years, people had to go outside when it was 30 degrees to use the bathroom."
 He also built a new dining room on the side, increasing the seating to 80. He even tinkered with the idea of moving the restaurant next door to the old Pier One building on First Street. "But when I mentioned it to customers, they said, 'No, don't move it!'"
 Another big change was the acceptance of credit cards in 2015. "For 45 years, we were cash-only," Ballas said. "When we added credit cards, I had to put it on the sign out front, because no one believed it."
 Despite the updates, Grecian Corner retained its atmosphere as a "simple, comfortable little place," as Ballas described it, and that's just how customers like it.
 Ann Jones has been coming to Grecian Corner for 48 of her 86 years. She would eat there often five times a week. Though she's not eating in the dining room during the pandemic, she still calls in to-go orders, and she can't wait to get back. "I miss it very much. I miss the people. I was very close to George and his wife, Loula, and Angelo is an exceptional person, too. They've been like family."
 Anne Butler said she has been going about once a week since the 1980s. "I always get the chicken souvlaki platter with the Greek salad," she said. "It's good food. It's consistent. I know what I'm getting. The staff knows my name. They know I like my tea unsweetened. They really take care of their customers. It's just an easy place to get a good meal."
 Linda Hill and her late husband, Gene, made it their go-to restaurant for years, partly because they lived just two blocks away in the West Highlands neighborhood. "This has been our neighborhood hangout for 38 years," she said. "We have celebrated anniversaries there. We have celebrated birthdays. My kids grew up eating there."
 She recalled that, when Gene Hill died four years ago, Angelo showed up unannounced with a carful of food.
 "He brought pans of chicken souvlaki, pita, jugs of iced tea and flowers. They're just extremely generous people," Hill said.
 This spring, regular customers like Borgia Walker placed large orders for takeout to go to charities, such as the Bethesda Center for the Homeless. Chris Clifton of Grace, Clifton and Tisdale bought enough food to feed dozens of law-enforcement officers. Often, Ballas would kick in his own contribution, too, knocking 10 or 20% off the bill for such donations.
 Customers have really stuck with the restaurant through the pandemic, Ballas said.
 "We've been blessed," said general manager Denise Decker, who has worked at Grecian Corner for 15 years. "People have bought gift cards. Some of our regulars come get food to go two or three times a week just to help us out."
 To thank such customers, Angelo Ballas had hoped to throw a party this month, setting up tents in the parking lot and cooking up a feast. Instead, he's coping with a pandemic, government restrictions and a nervous dining public.
 Grecian Corner has not closed at all during the pandemic, but it did shut the dining room from mid-March to Aug. 31 -- long after he was allowed to reopen. "I waited, because I wanted to see what was the safest and best thing to do. There was a lot we didn't know early on, so I didn't feel comfortable opening the dining room," Ballas said.
 One of the first things Ballas did was put Plexiglas across the front counter to separate customers and employees.
 When he reopened the dining room, he established a separate entrance for takeout and dining-in customers to avoid bottlenecks. The restaurant is still cozy, though, so with COVID-19 social distancing, it has only six or seven tables available.
 But takeout always has been a big part of Grecian Corner's business. "Traditionally, we were 35% takeout. So for us going from 35% to 100% takeout wasn't hard when the dining room was closed. Our menu lends itself it being takeout-friendly. We just ramped it up."
 Now, even with the dining room open, takeout is about 75% of business.
 One of the key components of Grecian Corner's takeout business has always been the medical center. "The hospital has been a great neighbor," Ballas said. He said he also draws a lot of customers from the Ardmore neighborhood on one side and Buena Vista on the other.
 Still, like most restaurants, Grecian Corner is having a rough year. "Catering (or lack of it) has had the biggest impact," Ballas said. "Because I'm a small restaurant, catering was like filling those extra seats we didn't have. There's money in catering, because you don't have as much overhead, but I lost all that this spring -- catering for pharmaceutical reps, for Wake Forest athletics."
 He said he has managed to keep his staff at about 15 people, though they may get fewer hours these days.
 "Business has dropped, but I've tried to keep as many people as I can," he said. "We got a PPP (Paycheck Protection Program loan), which was a lifesaver for about three months. At this point, we're just trying to watch expenses, watch food costs, keep inventory levels right -- just tightening our belt a little bit."
 Like other restaurateurs, he hopes that such measures will be enough to keep him going a few more months, until the pandemic begins to fade.
 "We're just trying to hold on and get back to normal, or whatever normal is going to be," Ballas said.
 But he's not complaining. He has a great staff. He has loyal customers. And he has 50 years under his belt.
 "Consistency would be the biggest thing," he said in explaining the restaurant's success. "Not just the food, but the people - having good staff is huge. And we've been fortunate this year that the menu lends itself to takeout."
 Still he doesn't take anything for granted. "We've been around for 50 years. But in this business you have to keep on your toes."

She added: “The Give and Take Box scheme also enables unperishable food close to ‘out of date’ to be distributed in the community rather than being thrown out, so it is very much part of the Love Food Hate Waste movement.”
