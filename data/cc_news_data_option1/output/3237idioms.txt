The Missouri State Softball team has high expectations for the 2021 season following a promising showing during their 2020 non-conference schedule.
 The Bears posted a 7-12 record before the season got cut short by COVID-19. Although not the most impressive on paper, the team showed a lot of promise against arguably the toughest non-conference schedule of any Missouri Valley Conference team.
 Some of the Bears highlights from the previous season included victories over Baylor and Creighton and two one-run losses to nationally ranked Oklahoma and Minnesota.

One protester held a sign bearing an historical quote: “Authoritarians need obedient civil servants — Timothy Snyder.”
 Some spoke of their ancestors' fight for the right to vote. Others urged people to contact their counties to see how they are planning for an expected surge in voters.
 Friends Stacey Johnson and Jamie Andrews wore shirts with “Nasty Woman” across the chest, a reference to Trump's description his former presidential opponent Hillary Clinton and U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, Joe Biden's pick for vice president.
 “We must do something,” Johnson said.
 Others in the crowd spoke about their patients' need for medicines that now already show up weeks late in the mail.
 Cars lined several streets in the DeJoy neighborhood. Some people rested on their bikes. Some held children in their arms or dogs on leashes.
 Everybody seemed to have a story.
 “Lately, I haven’t gotten my mail on time so I’m here for me,” said Catherine Holcombe, a retired teacher. “And then someone said what’s going to happen to the election? That’s going to be a big problem. So I have several concerns.”
 Scott Huffman, a Democratic candidate for the for the 13th Congressional District, said that the machines DeJoy had removed could sort millions of pieces of mail an hour. He and others noted that a lot of postal employees are veterans.
 Huffman, who wore a U.S. Postal Service shirt and U.S. Navy hat, also accused Trump and DeJoy of attacking the underpinnings of the country.
 “Are we going to let him?” he asked the crowd.
 “No!” Reverberated throughout the crowd.

“Classes were harder and more involved than I’d expected (during my return) and school became a full-time job,” Hilton said. “I started putting aside money in a bank account.”
 Hilton suggests starting a savings account to only access for emergencies, with a minimum of $500 as a single student or a minimum of $1000 as a married student.
 If you need to pull out money for loans, make sure you only take what you need, according to Rabon.
 “The temptation is going to be to take out as much as you can, but then you run the risk of messing with your opportunity cost,” Rabon said. “It will affect what you can do in the future, like taking nice vacations.”
 A similar scenario can be used when purchasing a meal plan.
 According to Rabon, students should only pay for the bare minimum of meals they need. If you know you won’t eat three meals a day, go for less.
 Despite living off-campus, Hilton said she and her husband struggled to pay for groceries until they learned how to better budget their money.
 “My husband and I went through a financial class and we were practicing budgeting everything we put money in,” Hilton said. “It gave us more power over where our money went. It took many months to get our grocery bill down, but we learned to always be in agreement where our money went. We are stronger for it.”
 Regardless of purchases, being aware of the cheaper alternatives is also important while budgeting.
 “With textbooks, the campus bookstore is bound to be more expensive, so take advantage of Google and check out Amazon, or ask the professor if you can use an older edition,” Rabon said. “Or, if an access code is required, some people sell access codes for a discounted price.
 “For groceries and other necessities, try Walmart. There are locations everywhere in Springfield. Just keep in mind that an item can be on sale in one location but still be cheaper at a different store.”
 Money management is pivotal for a successful livelihood, according to Rabon. Those who know when to turn down splurges will be better off in the long run.
 “A great thing about college is if you want to go to Waffle House at 3 a.m., you can,” Rabon said. “No one is there to tell you that you shouldn’t or that dropping $100 on a bar tab is a bad call. It’s up to you to stay organized.”

 One week of fall camp is in the books for area high school football teams.
 Monday started with uncertainty about how the players and coaches would respond to all being together again.
 Friday ended in pads and with high hopes for each squad.
 Here's a look at some of the storylines for both the week and future.
 -- Bartlesville High is still trying to settle on a starting quarterback to take the place of departed Ben Winters. Paxton Bradford and Harrison Clark might have the upper edge, but the coaching staff might look to develop a younger signal caller in Simian Gilkey or Dereck Farrimond and use the other two veterans to fill other critical spots.
 -- Pawhuska brought Oklahoma's all-time leading high school passing recordholder Mason Fine on board as a volunteer assistant. Fine's most important assignment could be to tutor Huskie quarterback Bryce Drummond, one of the top senior quarterback prospects in the nation. Drummond already has committed to the University of North Texas -- where Fine played and set records.
 -- Dewey also is looking for a new quarterback and holding a competition to fill the spot.
 -- Copan High's numbers are up and could reach as high as 18 or 19 -- more than double what the Hornets have averaged the past 10 years. Tyreek Millien could be the Hornets' next quarterback, although others also are in the mix.
 -- Wesleyan Christian only has 11, or so, players right now, but shows plenty of pop and potential.
 -- Caney Valley has opened up its quarterback competition.

Since we're talking about Terminator movies here we're going to have to leave Jonathan Jackson out of the mix for now since The Sarah Connor Chronicles was a TV show. But in the movies, the ranking is pretty easy to see for most people since Kyle Reese became a key character that, much like John Connor, was dumped the moment that James Cameron decided to trash the rest of the Terminator movies and go straight from T2: Judgment Day. The big downside of this is that we didn't get a fourth person that could have played Kyle Reese and instead we got what was supposed to be a tough as nails hybrid warrior that turned out to be tough, fast, strong, and resilient, but had a lot of limitations despite the very big feminist lean that the movie was given and the idea that women didn't need men to rescue them. That was until Arnold Schwarzenegger came into the movie and evened the odds up just a little bit since without him the new terminator would have slaughtered the heroes pretty quickly. Hey, remember when Kyle Reese managed to fight off a terminator on his own, saved Sarah's life, and made a getaway? Man, those were the days. Dark Fate could have been something great had they joined forces and allowed John Connor to survive and brought Mackenzie Davis and a new addition to the resistance into the mix. But that would have been too simple apparently. Oh well.

In earlier decades, officials tried to stop the "unsanctioned marine event" known as the Port Huron Float Down, but now there is a weary acceptance that on the third Sunday in August thousands of people will show up without fail, in storms, strong winds and, yes, even in a pandemic.

“On and off the court, they’re great,” Agugua-Hamilton said. “Shameka had some really big shots and some good key rebounds and blocked shots. (Willard) was tremendous all year. She’s the hardest working kid I think I’ve ever coached.”
 The task ahead is preparing for the upcoming season, and COVID-19 has thrown a wrench into a lot of the offseason plans for college teams — including the Lady Bears.
 “First it was permissible to do workouts — then it wasn’t permissible,” Agugua-Hamilton said in an early April interview. “It’s been kind of up in the air with a lot of things. So right now, everything is voluntary with the workouts they’re doing.
 “I do think they’re motivated and they’re doing some work on their own. But at the end of the day, when we get back together physically, I know that there’s going to be some work to be done.”
 Even with only graduating two seniors, the Lady Bears added more talent through recruiting.
 “The recruits are super excited,” Agugua-Hamilton said. “The ones that we have coming in, Dani and Paige, are both praying and hoping they can come in June.”
 The recruits Agugua-Hamilton mentioned are Danielle “Dani” Winslow and Paige Rocca.
 Winslow is a 6-foot wing player and a three-star recruit from Olathe South High School. Winslow is also a top-10 prospect at her position.
 Rocca is a 5’8” guard from Iowa City High School. Rocca is ranked 372nd nationally and eighth in Iowa.
 The Lady Bears play their home games at JQH Arena, also known as “The Q.” Their 2020-2021 schedule had not been released at press time.
