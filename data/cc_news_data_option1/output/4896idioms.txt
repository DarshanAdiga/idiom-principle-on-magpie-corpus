quot;So, we just need to navigate our way through any differences that might be there from time to time. But by and large, India was made a full member in 1926, the same year as New Zealand was. So we both have been around as cricketing nations for close to 100 years and we can all assume that we are important contributing members of the organisation,&quot; he said.

In the span of the last few episodes, we saw Satchel lose not one, but two fathers. Yes, we saw him literally watch the life exit Loy's eyes after Loy was stabbed in cold blood by Zelmare as a revenge killing in the closing moments of the season. But let's not forget that he was also trained to know when Rabbi Milligan's time on this earth was done as well. Rabbi, of course, was sucked into a tornado after facing down Calamita.  
 In the end, the fact that the character _Fargo_ fans know, remember, and love as Mike Milligan-- _Milligan,_ being the name he took on, and not Cannon-- tells a lot about how young Satchel perceived the events of Season 4. Obviously, he looked fondly on the fact that Rabbi was there for him way more than his actual father was. Sure, this was all rooted in "tradition," but Satchel's father gave him away as a human chess piece; Rabbi cared for him for the entirety of his short time on earth, and taught him survival skills that helped him at first on the side of the road, and that expanded to help him when we saw him in 1979, when we saw him in Season 2. ____

Reports said a Karachi bound speedy passenger van overturned and fell into a deep ditch when it took a turn on the National Highway at Sangi near Pano Aqil. The Pano Aqil Police and volunteers reached on the spot and rescued the victims of the incident. But 11 passengers were killed, including women and children. The police later shifted the bodies and injured to the Taluka Hospital, Pano Aqil.
 The witnesses told the media that the number of deaths went up due to the difficulties to access the fallen van in the deep ditch. They said there was no machinery to launch an immediate rescue operation to bring out the passengers from the van. The doctors of the Taluka Hospital, Pano Aqil, said that only one injured out of four was technically out of danger and was in his senses now.
 The rescued passenger said that they belonged to the same family from Rahimyar Khan and were going to Karachi to attend a marriage ceremony, while there were 15 people on board. The hospital sources said six children, three women and a man were among the dead along with the driver of the van. The deceased were identified as Hina, Tahira, Touba, Noor Fatima, Robina, Iram Rehman, Rizwan, Hanan, and Naiba.

Not surprisingly, the sudden announcement of the RBI-driven LVB-DBS merger has irked major shareholders of the Chennai-based ailing private sector lender. They are crying foul at the structuring of the amalgamations scheme which has wiped out their equity. But the aggrieved parties are clearly not in a mood to wave the white flag! We now hear a clutch of big global consultancies have queued up before a major LVB shareholder to offer their services and prepare an independent valuation of the bank. This move comes after the advisory firms got wind of the shareholder's intent to strengthen the ongoing legal fight by citing a far higher valuation, which the latter believes is deserved by the bank. The need of the hour is an independent valuation report to be presented before the court of law. This key shareholder hopes to rope in a big name soon. Watch this space for more.

Whicker: Rams bite the dust in another tug-of-war with the physical 49ers - Press Enterprise


--DocBreak--
The lame duck period has always been something of a dull, transitory state in American politics. We’re more accustomed to presidents using their last moments of authority to pardon powerful friends and other unpopular favors. Contrary to these expectations, however, President Donald Trump is going into overdrive to end the longest war in American history.
 In 2016, Donald Trump promised that he would bring our troops home from Afghanistan. Four years after his historic victory, 4,500 U.S. soldiers (and even more contractors) remain in Central Asia. Now, in a last-minute attempt to fulfill his promise and rebalance our obsolescent foreign policy, he has fired Secretary of Defense Mark Esper along with the Secretary’s Chief of Staff and Undersecretaries for Policy and Intelligence.
 This was the swiftest attempt at draining the swamp performed by the president in his four-year term, and it’s something he should have done much sooner. Donald Trump’s greatest mistake will always be not scouring Washington, D.C., clean immediately after his election.

GREEN BAY, Wis.
 Aaron Rodgers threw four touchdown passes and the Green Bay Packers beat the slumping Chicago Bears 41-25 on Sunday night to pad their NFC North lead.
 Green Bay (8-3) scored touchdowns on each of its first three possessions and grabbed a three-game division edge over Chicago (5-6) and Minnesota. Since winning five of their first six games, the Bears have dropped five straight.
 The Packers capitalized on mistakes by Bears quarterback Mitchell Trubisky, who was making his first start since the third week of the season. Trubisky threw three touchdown passes -- including two to Allen Robinson -- but also committed three turnovers that led to Packers touchdowns.
 Darnell Savage picked off a pair of Trubisky passes for his first two interceptions of the season. After Za'Darius Smith sacked Trubisky and forced a fumble, Preston Smith picked up the loose ball and ran 14 yards for a touchdown that gave the Packers a 27-3 lead late in the second quarter.
 Trubisky went 26 of 46 for 242 yards while starting in place of Nick Foles, who injured his glute and hip in a 19-13 loss to Minnesota on Nov. 16. Rodgers was 21 of 29 for 211 yards.

Renato Zero ha raccontato di una esibizione degli anni '70 quando uno squattrinato Zero viaggiava alla guida di un furgone, scaricava e montava da solo l'attrezzatura prima di iniziare a cantare. «Una volta mi esibii in un concerto a Tortoreto Lido- ha detto - nelle Marche ha proseguito Zero con sicurezza - Tortoreto Lido è nelle Marche».   Al sindaco di Tortoreto Domenico Piccioni, che non ha seguito il salotto televisivo domenicale, l'episodio è stato prontamente raccontato. Il primo cittadino risponde con ironia alla gaffe del cantante: «Renato Zero si esibì al Sayonara, uno evento rimasto nella storia come le serate di tanti altri big della musica, tra cui i Pooh, tenute presso lo stesso lido. E' trascorso molto tempo da allora e quindi possiamo solo perdonare la dimenticanza di questo grande personaggio che, anche se soltanto per un giorno, ci ha onorati della sua presenza. Approfitto però della piccola amnesia per invitare ufficialmente Renato Zero a farci visita, sarà nostro ospite e gli faremo scoprire come Tortoreto sia cambiata in meglio dagli anni 70 ad oggi».

I CONTROLLI   SEDICO I tamponi per accertare la positività al Covid 19 si potranno effettuare anche al palaRicolt. Il servizio non sarà fornito a tutti, ma andrà ad indirizzarsi comunque ad una parte significativa della popolazione locale. Il Comune di Sedico e Luxottica, infatti, hanno sottoscritto ed avviato un accordo di cooperazione per l'effettuazione di campagne di screening ai familiari dei dipendenti e collaboratori in servizio negli stabilimenti Luxottica di Sedico (che occupano, ricordiamo, circa 2500 persone). Il progetto avrà scadenza solo al termine dell'emergenza epidemiologica. Con questo accordo, a fronte della messa a disposizione gratuita da parte del comune degli spazi del palasport di Ricolt, Luxottica si impegna ad ammettere alle campagne di screening periodico anche i dipendenti e collaboratori del Comune di Sedico, su base volontaria e senza oneri per il Comune.   IL PERSONALE   L'azienda si impegna anche ad assicurare la collaborazione con i medici di base operanti sul territorio che dovessero trovarsi ad eseguire tamponi ai propri assistiti nei medesimi spazi esterni. «Il Sistema Welfare Luxottica commenta il sindaco di Sedico, Stefano Deon - rappresenta un modello di riferimento nel panorama industriale italiano con iniziative di natura economica, sanitaria, educativa e sociale per i dipendenti e i loro familiari. E' ispirato ad un rigoroso principio di sussidiarietà rispetto al welfare pubblico e si propone di sostenere le comunità locali nelle quali Luxottica è presente, affiancandosi alle reti istituzionali sia progettualmente sia operativamente». Luxottica ha da tempo intrapreso numerose azioni di tutela dei propri dipendenti e collaboratori, rispetto all'emergenza sanitaria in corso garantendo tra l'altro, appunto, la possibilità di effettuare tamponi su base volontaria. Adesso l'azienda, nell'intento di ampliare le iniziative di welfare territoriale, intende estendere tali misure di screening, su base volontaria, anche ai familiari dei propri dipendenti e collaboratori in servizio negli stabilimenti di Sedico.   L'AREA   «A tal fine spiega Deon Luxottica aveva richiesto al Comune di Sedico di poter disporre di locali adeguati per dare corso, periodicamente, a campagne per l'effettuazione di tamponi per prevenire la diffusione del virus Sars Cov-2, fino alla cessazione dell'emergenza epidemiologica. Anche a seguito di vari contatti informali e di sopralluoghi sul territorio comunale per ricercare luoghi adeguati abbiamo individuato alcuni locali del palazzetto dello sport di Ricolt e del parcheggio pertinenziale quale sede idonea per l'effettuazione delle campagne di screening».   I TERMINI   Il Comune si è reso pertanto disponibile a concedere l'uso, a titolo gratuito, di questi spazi, purché siano utilizzati senza interferire con altre attività eventualmente in corso, e assicurando la creazione di percorsi di accesso segnalati, separati ed esclusivamente dedicati ai soggetti che intendano sottoporsi a tampone. Luxottica dovrà anche garantire periodicamente pulizia, igienizzazione e sanificazione degli spazi e ammettere appunto alla campagna di screening anche i dipendenti del Comune di Sedico. Il progetto è partito il 24 novembre e avrà scadenza appunto solo al termine dell'emergenza epidemiologica. Il Comune di Sedico, in particolare, concede a Luxottica l'uso, a titolo gratuito, dei locali del Pronto soccorso, i servizi igienici attigui, posti al piano terra del Palazzetto dello Sport, l'area esterna ed il parcheggio. Il tutto fino al termine dell'emergenza epidemiologica, ma limitatamente alle giornate in cui Luxottica darà corso a queste attività di screening. In via indicativa il progetto prevede un impiego di due settimane ogni 30 giorni.   Egidio Pasuch   © RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA

Shout out to Nate Robinson. Most people wouldn’t dare get into the boxing ring and if they did they would certainly get washed in the exact same way that he did. The only thing is, Nate got paid a decent amount of money to get his butt beat. I think he’s going to have to learn to live with these Memes and also live in infamy now that he was knocked out cold in front of millions and millions and millions of people. I am not sure I would be able to take that regardless of how much money I got paid. Nonetheless, here is what he had to say and you can pass your own judgment on it.

Earbuds (or head-phones in the early days of telephony and radio) are a pair of small loudspeaker drivers worn on or around the head over a user's ears. They are electroacoustic transducers, which convert an electrical signal to a corresponding sound. Headphones let a single user listen to an audio source privately, in contrast to a loudspeaker, which emits sound into the open air for anyone nearby to hear. Headphones are also known as earspeakers, earphones or, colloquially, cans. Circumaural and supra-aural headphones use a band over the top of the head to hold the speakers in place. The other type, known as earbuds or earpieces consist of individual units that plug into the user's ear canal. In the context of telecommunication, a headset is a combination of headphone and microphone. Headphones connect to a signal source such as an audio amplifier, radio, CD player, portable media player, mobile phone, video game console, or electronic musical instrument, either directly using a cord, or using wireless technology such as Bluetooth, DECT or FM radio. The first headphones were developed in the late 19th century for use by telephone operators, to keep their hands free. Initially the audio quality was mediocre and a step forward was the invention of high fidelity headphones.

Carlos Bolsonaro, a key member of his father's social media team, kept his seat on the Rio council with more than 71,000 votes -- though that was fewer than the 106,000 he got four years ago.

"The claim is malicious because the volunteer was specifically informed by the medical team that the complications he suffered were independent of the vaccine trial he underwent. In spite of specifically being made aware of the same, he still chose to go public and malign the reputation of the company," Serum Institute said.

"We tried to do the roll up sign. We tried to have a blunt. We tried to say 'blaze one.' Bro, they had a legal girl there from the Jacksonville Jaguars and they're like 'no, no, no, no.' So finally I just said, 'why don't I just say I always have the best stuff.' … We couldn't do none of that but Chris did try. He did try to push the envelope because he even goes, 'what is that you do, Iranian tobacco? Say that, your fans will know.'"
 Konnan added, "When they were shooting with Jericho, they [Inner Circle] kept insisting I have drinks. Who am I to say no? They kept insisting I smoke. Why would I say no?"

I had to sign a million things just to do that scene and get COVID testing and they had a lawyer there. They do everything by the book. Their level of professionalism is very high. I was treated very well. They had me at a nice hotel, everything was very cool. Kudos to them on that."

It took five days for the 2020 election to be called for former Vice President Joe Biden. Five days with me peeled to the television and the internet. Five days holding my breath. Five days, meditating and praying for strength. I could not imagine four more years of Trump. I actually started going through my belongings, trying to decide which one would make the cut for my move to Ghana (yes, if the Chump had won, I was seriously considering a transcontinental move).

Coming up with artificial solutions which provide no actual protection for minority shareholders after the fact (even when they are "tailor-made and negotiated by the Board in light of the particularities of this Transaction") is no substitute for the actual protections which the independent members of the Board should have agreed if they had in fact fulfilled their fiduciary duties, such as a hard acceptance threshold; Mr Drahi not being allowed to vote on items where he so clearly has a conflict of interest; and sticking to the Dutch law requirement of providing a reasonable exit opportunity for minority shareholders - which this is clearly not.

The financial services space, especially the heavyweights, had led the avalanche of fund raising activity during the early days of the lockdown period through QIP's, preferential issue and a mix of other instruments. As we approach the end of the year, the segment is back in focus with many players eyeing listings. Investment banks are busy pitching to one of them, a housing finance player, backed by a global PE giant. If the plans fructify, it would be the first Indian IPO in this fund's portfolio in five years. A second housing finance player backed by a desi PE player is all set to launch its IPO in January or February. The same PE firm is also scouting for a pre-IPO fund raising round for its small finance entity. On the other hand, a fourth entity, a micro-finance player is in the wait and watch mode for the time being.
