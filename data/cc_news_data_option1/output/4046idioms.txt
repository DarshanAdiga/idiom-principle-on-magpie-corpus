If I'm going to use a robovac, I don't want to monitor it as it goes around my house. That's why I love that this one uses "laser smart technology" to map your home. You can set "no-go lines" after it maps each room so the D7 automatically knows not to cross over a heavily-wired area. You can also save up to three maps so you can conceivably use this vacuum to clean three floors, should you be so lucky to have that much space.
 The vacuum also comes with three ultra-performance filters designed to pick up 99% of allergens and dust mites. And, you can choose between eco and turbo cleaning modes; with turbo mode, the D7 uses maximum suction to pick up debris as small as 10 microns. Cleaning the Neato D7 is relatively easy, which I appreciate since I use the vac daily. After each cycle, you remove the dustbin from the top of the vac and tap out as much gunk from the filter as you can, or use the attached cleaning tool to cut out hairs and fibers off the brush. The filter has a screen over it so you can't really use the cleaning tool to brush out the debris.
 To test how well the D7 actually cleans up, I put a few tablespoons each of all-purpose flour, coffee grounds, and kitty litter on my carpet and hardwood floor and let the D7 do a cleaning cycle. On both the carpet and hardwood, the vacuum removed all of the coffee grounds and kitty litter without a trace leftover.
 The flour was a bit trickier, which seems to be the norm for robotic vacuums. On the carpet, it removed about 90% of the flour; on the hardwood, it was closer to 75%. I also sprinkled flour in corners of different rooms and though the vac didn't get everything, it came within a quarter of an inch of the corners, which is better than any of the other robotic vacuums I've tested.
 The D7 also does a great job with pet hair, which I didn't have to purposely set out because we have two cats who get the job done just fine. When I run the vacuum on its regular schedule, I didn't notice any cat hair left on the floor.
 As far as noise levels go, this is also the quietest robotic vacuum I've ever tested. My sound meter measured it at 66 decibels from a foot away, which is just slightly louder than a normal conversation from three feet away.

"I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color," Kaepernick said, according to NFL.com. "To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder."

In its evaluation of the ForgeRock Identity Cloud and Platform, a comprehensive solution for Customer and Workforce IAM needs, Forrester noted the “powerful workflow and policy abstraction called Trees that allows admins to create modular, customized, no-code or low-code workflows for all CIAM use cases, including registration, authentication, and self-service. Mapping data from existing user stores to the solution is easy. It supports early-stage, passwordless registrations out of the box; single sign-on (SSO) and validation flows are very broad and flexible.”
