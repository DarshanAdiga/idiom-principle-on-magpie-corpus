 Lee said conference calls with Continental leadership around the world are helping the megasupplier engage all operations in the shutdown.
 The conversations have included how to temporarily reroute supply chains, sourcing products from plants less affected by the virus and making engineering changes so products can be sourced from plants still up and running.
 "We have to make sure we keep customer requirements as part of our calculus in what we do. There have been government directives," Lee said. "There are many different constraints we have to work with.
 "The one positive thing I've taken away from this situation," he added, "is that it is forcing a much tighter communication and collaboration with your partners and customers."
 Lee, who has an MBA from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, joined Continental in 2014 after several years in the industry's battery and electronics segments with LG Chem and SK Innovation. He also led a New York- state instant-messaging startup.
 "While I still have some things to learn about the auto industry, I can bring some different perspectives as well," Lee said.
 His arrival at Continental North America coincides with the German giant's move deeper into advanced vehicle technologies, connected vehicles and autonomous driving.
 Just as the coronavirus was rearing its head, Continental was launching a sweeping corporate restructuring plan that included two U.S. plant closings, work force reductions and other cost-cutting efforts as a result of weakening global demand and the discontinuation of some operating activities.
 Lee said he does not expect the virus disruption to derail the plan nor change the company's direction. Continental North America will continue pushing ahead in new technologies while also improving its software capabilities, he said.
 Lee has lofty goals. They include better attuning Continental's R&D capabilities to the needs of North American customers and working more with emerging automakers, such as Tesla, Lucid Motors and Rivian.
 On the pandemic front, there are lessons to be learned from how Continental navigated the crisis in Asia when it first appeared last year, Lee said.
 Continental's Asian operations implemented social distancing guidelines early throughout the region. It also encouraged employee virus testing, introduced masks and adopted the practice of taking employees' temperature as they returned to offices and plants. Those practices are being applied now in North America.
 "There are some lessons to be learned here in terms of how we manage crisis and stabilize the supply chain," Lee said.
 "But in terms of our overall focus on technology, and building our capabilities and software and services, I don't think any of that has changed."

At the same park, Lauren, who declined to provide her last name for fear of being outed as a scofflaw, allowed her sheepadoodle, Elway, to roll around in the grass. She knew the park was closed, but came anyway.
 “I guess it’s kind of frustrating,” she said of the park closures. “We come here three times a day.”
 Within minutes, Scott had approached Lauren, Elway and another woman and her dog, and informed them the park was closed.
 Scott told The Seattle Times he wasn't too concerned by the people he had seen in the park. "Mostly everyone is aware of the rules," he said.
 But as temperatures ticked higher through Sunday, there were signs that more people were showing up to parks to enjoy the sunshine.
 As temperatures rose above 55 degrees, a steady flow of joggers, cyclists and roller-bladers could be seen circling Green Lake on the park trail by the water. The tennis and basketball courts were empty, but several picnic blankets still dotted the daisy-filled hills nearby. There were few indications that the park was closed.
 Hannah McCausland, 23, and Bubba Schwanner, 31, said they didn’t realize Green Lake Park was off-limits. The couple was having a picnic with wine, cheese, strawberries and backgammon to celebrate their six-month anniversary.
 Green Lake wasn’t their first choice, however. The couple first tried Gas Works Park before getting kicked out.
 “We need[ed] to get out,” McCausland said. McCausland had been struggling with her mental health in recent weeks, she said, and being cooped up wasn’t helping.
 “I think not knowing when it’s going to end — that's what drives my anxiety,” McCausland said.
 At Discovery Park on Sunday, gated entrances that had been open the day before were tied with chains and zip ties. A parking lot off Emerson Street West was blocked with caution tape and the pedestrian entrance was chained with a paper sign that read “park closed until Mon,” accompanied by a smiley face.
 Some still managed to get inside the city’s largest park. Around 4 p.m., a group of hikers and cyclists who said they came in near the beach were having trouble finding their way out.
 A group at Gas Works Park on Sunday, however, ignored Parks staffers' directions to leave until Seattle police were called, the Parks Department said.
 Even after police dispersed the group, Parks employees scrambled to intercept droves of other people on foot, bicycle and Solowheel as they attempted to get inside Gas Works later in the afternoon.
 Several people and their dogs managed to slip through the park's initial defenses before being asked to leave once inside.
 Others made alternative plans: Across the street from the main Gas Works parking lot, Connor McDermott, 27, and Garbo Grossman, 31, inflated a raft. Their plan was to avoid the park, but still enjoy some socially distant time on Lake Union.
 "It makes sense," McDermott said of the city's decision to close major parks. "It's a nice day. Otherwise there would be swarms of people."

The company, which has 62 people on its payroll, is used to making fast decisions and relies on personal meetings when issues arise, Payne said. That changed when everyone started working from home on March 13.
 "If I have a problem with a design, I'll walk 40 feet over and talk to the designer or engineer who owns that thing and talk it through in three minutes," Payne recalled of normal times. "Now, I have to set up a call and they have to find a spot on my calendar, or I have to find a spot on theirs. And that meeting is guaranteed to be a half-hour, but usually it's an hour because you have to talk it through and share screens and show pictures and fumble through" the computer-assisted-design material.
 Nissan's North American R&D operations employ roughly 1,400 engineers. Some engineers have said they, too, are putting in longer hours at home to get the same amount of work done.
 "I talked to a few engineers who told me they find themselves working more during this time period," Flotkoetter said of work time spilling over into other hours. "They don't have that clear line."
 Ford's Schabel says his work computer stays on longer as he moves between engineering time and working with his wife to home-school their two children.
 Tabar worries about her staff as the weeks of working at home grind on. She holds two conference calls a day to keep them informed on Toyota's internal corporate news, to check on their well-being and to help resolve issues.
 "That's the most stressful thing, to make sure they're not feeling too overwhelmed, feeling so much pressure to keep up their due dates, while still trying to work at a site that they're not used to, with their children running all over. It's a very tough thing to transition to," she says.
 While it is not certain when product development engineers and the rest of the industry will go back to work, it can't come soon enough for some.
 "It's pretty darn stressful," Payne said. "We've got a lot of people who are really good at working hard but fast. And this slows them all down. It's like you have a track full of racehorses just champing at the bit. But they can't go more than a gallop. And it is hard."

In reposting the message, Trump added: “Sorry Fake News, it’s all on tape. I banned China long before people spoke up.”
 The tweet came amid a flurry of messages blasted out by the president Sunday defending his handling of the coronavirus, which has come under sharp criticism, and pointing the finger instead at China, the World Health Organization, President Barack Obama, the nation’s governors, Congress, Democrats generally and the news media.
 Trump did not “ban China,” but he did block non-American citizens or permanent residents who had been in China in the past 14 days from coming into the U.S. starting Feb. 2. Despite the policy, 40,000 Americans and other authorized travelers have still come into the country from China since that order.
 Fauci and other public health experts were initially skeptical that the China travel restrictions would be useful when the president was first considering them, but then changed their minds and told Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, on the morning of Jan. 30 that they supported them.
 Trump has repeatedly pointed back to those travel limits to defend his handling of the pandemic, but experts have said the limits were useful mainly to buy time that the administration did not then use to ramp up widespread testing and impose social distancing policies before infections could begin growing exponentially.
 By the third week of February, advisers had drafted a list of measures they believed would soon be necessary, like school closures, sports and concert cancellations and stay-at-home orders, but the president did not embrace them until mid-March.
 Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, said Sunday that earlier imposition of such policies would have made a difference.
 “I mean, obviously, you could logically say that if you had a process that was ongoing and you started mitigation earlier, you could have saved lives,” he said on “State of the Union” on CNN. “Obviously, no one is going to deny that. But what goes into those kinds of decisions is complicated. But you’re right. Obviously, if we had, right from the very beginning, shut everything down, it may have been a little bit different. But there was a lot of pushback about shutting things down.”
