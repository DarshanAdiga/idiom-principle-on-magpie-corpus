But while the standard bike Ural sells is pretty damn impressive on its own, I’m more interested in what an electric one would be like. While I don’t have to imagine it from scratch because Ural put out what looked like a production- ready electric concept bike two years ago, I am left wondering why we don’t have it yet.

“It's really hard to speculate, but I think if schools see if a ‘Stanford’ could cut men's volleyball — one of the most successful academic and athletic programs in the nation and in the world — then ‘why can't we and save a couple hundreds of thousands of dollars down the road?’” Erik said. “I pray to God that it does not and we can get this back up and running as quick as possible. But if we look in the long run, if this decision isn't reversed, then Stanford could play a very large part in, honestly, just killing the sport of volleyball.”

It's an _incredible_ moment for a series that, at times, has a penchant for the melodramatic. To think a couple seasons ago that _Yellowstone_ would highlight the darkness of victim blaming is a shock, to say the least. __But in the back half of Season Three, _Yellowstone_ has managed to create this microcosm of badass women who are learning to work outside the confines of the types of women we often see in westerns. Even in this week's secondary story where a Native American girl named Sila goes missing and is found dead, Chief Rainwater (Gil Birmingham) and Monica (Kelsey Asbille) have a frank conversation about how indigenous people are a bother to the American government because they only are interested in the land the Native American people hold. Monica steps up to lead the charge to protect indigenous women in Montana.

With the way that Season Three has evolved, especially over the past two or three weeks, it seems that Sheridan has a plan to take __these women who anchor the series and say a lot more with their story than viewers initially expected. The darkness that _Yellowstone_ has become known for has shifted, alluding to something more meaningful than it did at the start __.
 As __the series continues to wade into the complex social waters that it has throughout most of Season Three, it will be interesting to see what Sheridan has in store for the female characters who are bringing the series to life. For a series that seems to be continually on the rise in popularity, narratives like the ones in this season will only keep viewers coming in. That _and_ the occasional voyeuristic wolf. __ __ __

CLAYTON, N.Y. (WWNY) - Sunday was the final day of competition at the 2020 SiteOne Bassmaster Elite at St. Lawrence River in Clayton with a first place check of $100,000 dollars on the line.Unlike the first 3 days of the SiteOne Bassmaster Elite at St. Lawrence River, rough conditions greeted the 10 anglers competing for the title on Sunday.The tournament boiled down to a 2 man race for the title between the leader the first 3 days, Paul Mueller, and Chris Johnston, who held down 2nd place through 3 days of fishing.Mueller entered the day with just more than a 2 pound lead over Johnston, but unlike the first 3 days of fishing, where he averaged 25.5 pounds, Mueller would hit a rough patch and haul in 5 fish for 18 pounds 15 ounces on Sunday for a 4 day total of 95 pounds 14 ounces.”It was rough right from the get-go and I made a decision to go. You know, I put all my eggs into Lake Ontario basket and, you know, I just didn’t think I could put together a good bag to contend in the river today just given the conditions. And I don’t have any complaints other than maybe I should have fished there a little bit longer. But you never know, I mean the winds building and the waves are getting- They’re not getting any smaller so what an incredible week,” said Mueller, who finished second.Chris Johnston, meantime, was looking to rebound from a heartbreaking final day loss in Waddington last year, a tournament he led the first 3 days and he would do just that.Johnston would reel in 5 fish on Sunday for a total weight of 22 pounds 12 ounces and a 4 day total of 97 pounds 8 ounces, giving him the 2020 SiteOne Bassmaster Elite at St. Lawrence title and making him the first ever Canadian to win a Bassmaster Elite event.”It’s great. 2020′s been a crazy year fishing wise for me. I had 2 of the worst tournaments of probably my career and to bounce back here on the St. Lawrence of all places, it’s just incredible. Kinda at a loss for words and I’ve wanted this bad, especially on the St. Lawrence River. A big tournament win and it finally came together. Normally when the weather conditions come like this on the 3rd day, I’ve been burned. I couldn’t go out to the lake and today it was still open and luckily I got out there and was able to get it done,” said Johnston.An incredible finish to a great week of fishing. A week most of the anglers said was one they will remember for years to come.”I had a great time. These people in Clayton are awesome. I mean, I don’t know how, I’ve had hundreds of people every day come running down the dock and just talk to me and hey, I told my cameraman this morning on the way to our first spot. I said ‘man ‚you hungry today,’ I said when they get us on live I’m gonna ask for some sandwiches and man it wasn’t 30 minutes later here come a guy bringing me some sandwiches,” said Brock Mosley, who finished in third.Copyright 2020 WWNY.

Associate law professor Rabia Belt, whose Disability Law class is the only one of its kind on campus, says the ADA is designed to ensure that there is not only equality but true equity to ensure a fair game for everyone. The Act strives to “make people with disabilities integrated as part of the world,” she said, and that mandating accommodations and modifications are integral because people with disabilities “were coming into a space that was not designed with them in mind.”
