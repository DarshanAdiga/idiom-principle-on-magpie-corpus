  # Ice storm enhances escapades on farm


  Hanaba Welch


  View Comments


  At the end of a day on ice, I suddenly understand the meaning of the show name “Ice Capades.” All it takes is a little ice to turn ordinary activities into escapades. No skates required.


  Yes, I’m slow. It’s taken me all my life to figure out that “capade” by itself is not a stand-alone word. That said, “ice-capade,” hyphenated, seems to have fallen into general usage. The legendary Ice Capades should probably get some credit for the origin of the term, but any such etymology would be lost on Millennials. They don’t know Lawrence Welk either.


  Anyway, I decided yesterday’s ice would make the day ideal for a voting escapade. Sure enough, I had my choice of the machines.


  Invigorated by my icy drive to town, I kept my risk level up by voting in Spanish. (It was like the time I pushed “dos” for Spanish. Adrenaline is where you find it.)


  After I cast my ballot, the cows set the agenda for the afternoon. They demanded a cold-weather handout.


  The tractor acted sluggish. By the time I’d managed to spear and move and feed a bale of hay, the tractor wouldn’t budge. Not good.


  If there’s anything that comes in handy on a farm when ice and slush prevail, it’s a functioning tractor. I still remember Daddy starting the old John Deere one dark and stormy night when it was our only working vehicle. Maybe we’d stuck both cars. I don’t remember. Mother and I watched from nearby.


  First Daddy had to dry something – maybe where the coil wire goes into the distributor. It seemed odd to me that just one paper towel could fix everything. Pop, pop, pop, pop. Nothing beats the sound of a two-cylinder John Deere on a wet wintry night.


  I don’t remember the rest of that adventure. I just remember that glorious moment when the tractor started.


  Back to yesterday. Because the tractor wouldn’t move, I couldn’t use the bale spear to properly unroll the big round bale. The longhorns were quite happy to manage on their own, using their horns not only to delve into the hay but also to keep the other cows away.


  Feeling sorry for the polled and dehorned mamas, I decided to head back to town for some feed cubes.


  I was backing a flatbed trailer with my usual finesse when the front right tire on the truck went into a mysterious mini-sinkhole. Stuck, I had effectively blockaded the driveway.


  In retrospect I should not have tried next to blaze a new trail with the old Chevy pickup. The ice-coated lantana bush won. Use your imagination.


  My car was blocked in. My other car was a mile away at the other house. I walked into the north wind as darkness fell along with the temperature.


  Somehow it made voting in Spanish seem like no big deal.


  And the real Ice Capades?


  I think all the renowned extravaganza lacked was a “Hee Haw” segment. I think I could write it.


   _Hanaba Munn Welch_ , a correspondent for the Times Record News who divides her time between Abilene and a farm north of Vernon, appears on Mondays. Her columns, as a tribute to the Childress Engine 501, always contain, amazingly, 501 words.

NILES — The decades-long wait for Brandywine is finally over as the Bobcats won its first playoff football game in school history on Friday night at Selge Field, downing Comstock 44-7 in their MHSAA Division 6, district 45 playoff opener.
 “We came out ready to play today,” Brandywine coach Mike Nate said. “We had a great first half and everything was clicking. We’re happy to get out of here with a “W” and make history tonight.”
 Brandywine quarterback Gabe Gouin was the driving force behind Friday’s blowout win, racking up 78 yards and four touchdowns on 13 carries and completing all three passes he attempted for 75 yards. Running back Michael Palmer led the Brandywine backfield with 107 yards on 17 carries. Senior tight end Cam Barrier caught two passes for 34 yards and added a couple two-point conversion grabs for the Bobcats.

If you own a company—or are employed at one—you know there is much more to your business’ success than simply showing up each morning for work; you are an important part of an organic and hopefully well-defined operational system. Every company is a living and breathing entity, with warm bodies at the core of its existence (at least until intelligent machines become our overlords). This metaphor of a living corporate organism has been likened many times in business books and allied jargon…

Losing power wasn't just an inconvenience for people going about their daily lives in Iredell County, it put a damper on early voting at two sites.
 However, it may have been the lack of power, not the weather itself, that slowed down voting.
 Electricity at the Harmony and Troutman early voting sites went out on Thursday, leading to a considerable drop in early voting compared to earlier in the week.
 After averaging 274 voters between Monday and Wednesday, Harmony only had 24 voters come through before the power went out. In Troutman, there were only 114 voters on Wednesday, down from the average of 509 a day earlier in the week. The other four sites saw roughly the same number of voters, or more, despite the storm.

Actor Mukesh Khanna, who essayed the iconic roles of _Shaktiman_ in the popular show of the same name and _Bhishma Pitamah_ in BR Chopra's _Mahabharat_ , is under fire on social media for his remarks on the ‘MeToo’ movement.
 In an interview with The Filmy Charcha, the actor can be seen saying in Hindi that sexual assault and harassment started happening only after women had started stepping out and going to work.
 What the actor said in the clip was “Men and women are made differently. A woman’s job is to look after the house, forgive me for saying this at times. The MeToo problem began when women started going to work. Today, women talk about being equal to men. People talk about women’s liberation, but all that’s the core of all the issues. The first family member to suffer is the child who does not get the attention of his mother. They would be watching a saas-bahu TV serial with their nanny.”

Women in Consumer Technology hosted its fifth annual Women in CT Career Enhancement Forum at the Rubin Museum of Art in New York.
    Held last month in conjunction with CE Week and titled "Design Your Life: A Roadmap to Success Amid Change," the forum gave 85 attendees concrete ideas, inspiration and step-by-step methods on how to achieve advancement in the consumer technology industry.
 "I've attended the forum event every year, and each time I come away with a wealth of knowledge that helps me focus and achieve my career goals amid new challenges," said Amelia Moore, a Women in CT member. "This year's Women in CT Forum was full of valuable takeaways to help women lead in the CT industry."
 The forum opened with a passionate keynote address from The New York Times bestselling author, journalist and popular lecturer, Gail Sheehy. Sheehy described how, in a male dominated industry, she reached the top. She urged attendees to dream big, take risks, outlive the early failures and build toward success with meaning and social purpose by midlife.
 The hands-on interactive day also featured Sam Horn, who has presented at TEDxNASA and gave attendees a step-by-step plan on how to facilitate what is most meaningful in their lives. Kendra Thomas, head of global diversity for Pearson, presented a talk about leveraging gender intelligence to transform cultures. Deena Ghazarian, senior partner for TargetPath, and Melissa Andresko, communications director of public relations for Lutron Electronic, brought to life the group's Connect Circle Program. Finally, award-winning journalist Andrea Smith and mother-daughter team Karyn Schoenbart, president and COO for the NPD Group, and Danielle Sporkin, client partner at the digital media agency Essence, shared generational experiences in how to use best practices for today's business world.
 "The mission of our annual Career Enhancement Forum is to give women the tools, information, and the support they need to succeed in CT," said Carol Campbell, founder of Women in CT. "This year, many of the messages from our excellent lineup of speakers really hit home and generated a lot of discussion in our breakout sessions. The knowledge and relationships I saw being built are what Women in CT strives for and what make this conference a great asset to the women in the CT industry."

Ameerah Haq still recalls with a bit of incredulity the day a decade ago when she realized that the lofty commitments the United Nations had made for years – to place women in senior peace and security positions – had been largely lip service.
 Assembling for a group photo with other special representatives for the U.N. secretary-general like herself, the Bangladeshi diplomat looked around and realized she was the only woman in a sea of men.
 “I recall thinking, ‘This is 2010. It’s not 1950 or 1960,’” says the former special representative for East Timor. “‘Can we not do better than this?’”
 As it turns out, yes we – or rather the U.N. – can.
 Less than four years after Secretary-General António Guterres took up his post in January 2017 with a commitment to achieve gender parity in senior positions at the U.N., dozens of women have been named to key positions, and Mr. Guterres continues to all appearances to pursue his goal with a vengeance.

 Burke County coach Eric Parker has led his team to overwhelming success against Thomson the past 12 seasons, compiling an 11-3 record against the Bulldogs in 14 meetings.
 Some of those victories included upsets. Like last season, when most expected Thomson to be the better team. The Bulldogs jumped out to a 21-14 lead at halftime, but Burke County pitched a shutout in the second half en route to a 37-21 win to secure a region title.
 Thomson's most recent win in the series came in 2016 -- at the Bear Den nonetheless.
 The Bulldogs likely haven't forgotten about last season's meeting. The disappointment of losing to a rival. The disappointment of failing to score in the second half. The disappointment of seeing Burke County secure a region title.
 But that was then.
 If there's one thing we've learned from Thomson this season, it's that in many cases situations filled with adversity have become moments to successfully overcome. The Bulldogs have rallied past second-half deficits and held off late-game charges.
 While a win at Burke County wouldn't move them directly to the top of the region, it would keep the Bulldogs in the running for the title and give them a victory to be proud of.
 Despite a loss to Richmond Academy, the Bulldogs have one of the fastest teams in the region. With Tay Martin on offense and Snoop Williams on both sides of the ball - with playmakers scattered around the field - Thomson has a good chance to get a win over Burke County.
 If that happens, Thomson needs a Richmond Academy loss this week against Morgan County and to Burke County in the regular-season finale to grab the region title.
 If Burke County beats Thomson, the region will come down to its meeting with Richmond Academy.

Collin Hershberger has been coming up clutch for Newton High School in two sports this fall -- as a midfielder for the Railer boys soccer team and a kicker for the football team.
   
 A 40-yard blast in the 106th minute from Hershberger off a Santiago Fernandez throw in gave the Railer soccer team a 3-2 overtime win over Emporia on Thursday in the Class 5A regional semifinals at Fischer Field.
   
 "I saw the ball coming at me and I took it off my head," Hershberger said. "No one was really around me, so I had a go. It was going off the post all game, so I was fortunate that it went in."
   
 Newton started out strong, but struggled connecting passes as the game went on.
   
 "I think we were overconfident," Hershberger said. "We beat them early in the season and thought we had it in the bag. They came out and surprised us. We had to play our game and keep it in our hands and keeping it under control."
   
 Newton played the final 27 minutes a player down when Carson Ebert was ejected for an alleged dive. He had been given a yellow card in the 69th minute. Newton was given a total of four yellow cards and a red. Emporia was given three yellows.
   
 "That was just fuel on the fire for us," Hershberger said. "That stayed in the back of our heads as something to motivate us."
   
 Hershberger said he practices once a week with the football team and spends the rest of the time with the soccer team.
   
 "The coaches are really willing to work with me," Hershberger said. "I normally go to practices for football on Wednesday and come to soccer practice Monday and Wednesday, and go to the games on Tuesday, Thursday and Friday."
   
 Hershberger, a sophomore, has hit several field goals and made most of his PATs this season and several goals for the soccer team.
   
 "We've been working on it," Hershberger said. "Ben (Schmidt) is a good holder and we have a good snapper. We've really been working on that. Our offense has been scoring a lot, so it's a good deal."
   
 "Collin is everywhere on the field," Newton soccer coach Scott Jantzi said. "He's our workhorse in the middle. The ball just came to him and he hit a nice volley. From my angle, it was just a nice bend over the keeper. He spends most of the time with us, so we get to train with him. He won't be able to train tomorrow. He's such a great athlete. The soccer knowledge is there."
   
 Newton outshot Emporia 26-11, 18-10 on goal. Newton used backup goaltender Yael Aramburu, who finished with eight saves. Diego Reyes had 15 saves for Emporia, which ends the season 7-8-1.
   
 Hector Hernandez had both goals for the Spartans. Kevin Rios had an assist.
   
 Fernandez finished with a goal and an assist for Newton.
   
 The Railers controlled the game for the first 10 minutes, getting off the first four shots of the game and scoring on a corner kick converted by Mikey Parga. Armando Alvarez had the assist.
   
 A miscue by the Railer defense in failing to clear out a ball in the back allowed Hernandez to equalize on a crossing pass.
   
 Newton held an 8-7 advantage in total shots in the first half.
   
 Newton regained the lead in the 49th minute when the Emporia keeper stepped out of the penalty area with the ball. Fernandez nailed the direct kick.
   
 Hernandez equalized again on a breakaway in the 61st minute.
   
 Newton got the first two shots of overtime. One was blocked by a defender. The second was off the post. Newton had another post shot in the 90th minute. Newton outshot Emporia 4-1 in the second half of the first overtime.
   
 Emporia got the only shot of the first half of the second overtime.
   
 "Emporia came out with a good game plan," Jantzi said. "They came out and had our forwards marked. Further down the field, they were marking our outside flanks. In that first half, we had a really hard time of getting rid of our defender. We had our opportunities to finish it off in regulation. We just didn't put the ball in the back of the net. In the last two days, we've been inside and there really isn't an opportunity to do much inside except get a few ball touches. We'll be able to train out here tomorrow evening and be out here ready to play Saturday."
   
 Newton, 11-6, will host 9-8 Andover Central at 1 p.m. Saturday in the regional finals. Newton downed Central 2-0 at home on Sept. 27. Central downed crosstown rival Andover 1-0 to advance.
   
 "They're a good team," Hershberger said. "We need to come to play and get a result and make it to state."

Of course, in this highly partisan and closely divided moment, adoption of any change, no matter how warranted or beneficial, seems unlikely. Yet proposals of this ilk merit assessment. Any proposal that might fly in the face of tradition, whether enshrined in founding documents as with life tenure or in public perceptions, as with the number of justices, should be subject to serious scrutiny. What is necessary for measured thought, then, is a “cooling off” period when facts and fictions can be separated.

Successivamente si tenterà di aprire una breccia tra i temi più complessi e controversi dell’istituto, un approfondimento, questo, dedicato a tutti coloro i quali vorranno cimentarsi con una discesa negli inferi di una materia così variegata. Si cercherà, quindi, negli articoli di prossima pubblicazione, di esaurire le questioni inerenti al tema trattato, avendo sempre ben evidente l’obiettivo primario che si è imposto questa testata, vale a dire quello di rendere sufficientemente intellegibile, anche per il lettore non specialista, una materia ostica come il diritto, in generale, e quella che ci accingiamo ad affrontare, in particolare.

He was a quick study (he finished his aeronautical engineering degree at Virginia Tech in two years). He joined NASA not long after it was created in 1958 and helped design a space program from scratch. It was a mighty undertaking. There were so many things he had to think through — like developing a communications system that would allow him to speak to the crew every 15 minutes. "What do I have to do to do that?" he asked, "Well, I had to build a whole damn worldwide network which had never been before. That, in itself, was quite a job."

"[The fajas] ended up in the black market," Ovalle says. "So if you're a place that sells fajas and you can get this good Colombian product for only like 20 bucks a pop as opposed to 50 bucks a pop... and then you can sell it for over a hundred while you're making a pretty good return."
