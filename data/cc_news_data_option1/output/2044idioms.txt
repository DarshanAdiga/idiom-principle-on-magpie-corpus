WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress is at a crossroads in the coronavirus crisis, wrestling over whether to “go big,” as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wants for the next relief bill, or hit “pause,” as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell insists.It's a defining moment for the political parties heading toward the election and one that will affect the livelihoods of countless Americans suddenly dependent on the federal government. Billions of dollars in state aid, jobless benefits and health resources are at stake. As questions mount over Washington's proper role, it's testing the ability of President Donald Trump and Congress to do the right thing."These are the eternal debates in American history," said Richard Sylla, a professor emeritus of economic and financial history at New York University.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., speaks at a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, May 12, 2020. Standing behind McConnell is Senate Majority Whip John Thune, R-S.D. As negotiations develop on Capitol Hill, the coronavirus response offers Congress an opportunity to shape the country's post-pandemic future but also carries the risk of repeating mistakes of past crises, including the 2008-09 recession, that history does not easily forget."It's a bit like what Andrew Hamilton was facing in 1790," he said, describing the plan to have the new federal government assume the Revolutionary War debts of the states, despite protests of a bailout. It was, he said, as Hamilton framed it, "the price of liberty."As negotiations develop on Capitol Hill, the coronavirus response offers Congress an opportunity to shape the country's post-pandemic future but also carries the risk of repeating mistakes of past crises, including the 2008-09 recession, that history does not easily forget.Trump and McConnell huddled late last week on next steps after rejecting Pelosi's plan. The Democratic speaker set the table with passage of the sweeping $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill, which includes $1 trillion to shore up states and cities to avert municipal layoffs, $1,200 stipends to Americans and other aid."We could have done bigger," Pelosi told The Associated Press in a recent interview.With more than 38 million unemployment claims, the Republican response centers on kick-starting the economy to reduce the need for more federal intervention.Republican priorities are to wean Americans off unemployment benefits to nudge people back to work and provide liability protections for businesses that reopen.Republicans want to eliminate the $600 weekly unemployment benefit boost, arguing it "handcuffs" some employees with higher pay than they earn at their jobs. McConnell also wants to protect doctors, schools and others from COVID-19-related lawsuits — a "red line," he says, for any deal."There's a high likelihood we will do another rescue package," McConnell said on Fox News. "We need to work smart here."The political and economic debate stretches beyond the halls of Congress as wary Americans await Washington's next move.It was Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell who counseled Pelosi to rely on historically low interest rates to "go big," while Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warned of "permanent damage" to the economy unless businesses reopen.Washington has been here before. Staring down the 2008-09 financial crisis forced the House and Senate into a historic debate over the size and scope of government that still resonates today.Then, like now, countless Americans fell swiftly into the ranks of the newly unemployed, while the very foundations of the American dream — home ownership then, health now — hung in the balance. Then, banks needed a federal lifeline; today, businesses look to Washington for help.Pelosi told the AP the biggest lesson learned was to be "very prescriptive" in how the money would be spent after facing a backlash that the rescue benefited Wall Street over Main Street.But perhaps another lesson from the earlier crisis was the voter revolt against big government. The bank bailout and recovery act sparked the rise of the tea party wing of the GOP. Pelosi lost her gavel in the 2010 election, and Republicans took control of the House.Many of the same tea party forces — including the deep- pocketed Koch network — are aligned with Trump's push to prevent state aid, reopen the country and get people back to work."The American people need to understand the choices they have," said North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, one of the most endangered Republicans seeking reelection in the fall, during an online forum with the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity.Tillis opposes Pelosi's "manifesto" and doesn't expect the Senate to act before July. He said of the GOP-held Senate, "We're a bulkhead against bad happening."Despite rare bipartisan support for earlier aid, the $2 trillion bill approved in March, neither side was particularly pleased with the outcome, the largest federal intervention in U.S. history.Polling, however, shows Americans favoring the federal response, even as they have some concerns about spending.An AP-NORC poll conducted in late March found that elements of the stimulus package were widely popular. The poll found that about 9 in 10 Americans favored the federal government providing funding to small businesses and hospitals.About 8 in 10 said they were in favor of suspending evictions and foreclosures, giving lump-sum payments to Americans, increased unemployment benefits and suspended student loan payment.A mid-April NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showed registered voters somewhat more likely to say they were concerned about the federal government spending too much on economic stimulus and driving up the budget deficit than they were worried that too little money would be spent, lengthening the recession, 48% to 40%. The remaining 12% said they didn't know.Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow acknowledged the $3 trillion proposal is a "big number."But she said on her drive home to hard-hit Michigan, "The cost of inaction will be much higher."___Associated Press Director of Public Opinion Research Emily Swanson contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

Thus, investors are now placed in a dicey fork-in-a-road-situation. They may choose to continue the ISDS arbitration and bear the (enhanced) risk of not getting any enforcement down the road. Or, they may opt for the settlement procedure, which yet arguably provides for a very narrow leeway for successful claims. To give but one example, the Italian Constitutional Court has upheld the legitimacy of all the measures taken to scale down, and eventually repeal, the Feed-in-Tariffs schemes for RES sources subject to ISDS litigation. Facilitators are bound to acknowledge this development when settling the dispute. Thus, should investors opt for the settlement procedure, their claims are likely to be quashed even before reaching the merits of the dispute.

3rd-placed Leipzig welcome 11th-placed Hertha Berlin to the Red Bull Arena, on the back of a 5-0 thrashing of Mainz. Hertha also enjoyed success, as they battered local rivals Union 4-0 in the Berlin Derby. A win for Bayern in Der Klassiker coupled with a victory for Leipzig in their match would see them move ahead of Dortmund in the Bundesliga table on goal-difference. The opposite result would see them close the gap to the top to 4 points. Basically, if they beat Berlin, they will well and truly be involved in the title race. But Berlin could break into the top half of the table with a victory, and perhaps get involved in the fight for the Europa League spots. Another interesting fixture to kick-off Wednesday.

The Breckenridge Fire Department will be working on rebuilding an army surplus truck into a tanker that will allow for the department to spray water while driving at the same time. The truck is expected to be rebuilt and finished in fall 2020.
 Fire Chief Nathan Summerville for Breckenridge, Minnesota, explained that for over the past years, the department has been working to replace its oldest tanker that is a model from 1985.
 The department has been applying for various grants for the last 4-5 years for approximately $240,000 which would pay for a new tanker. However, they have not received any grants.
 “We were able to acquire an Army surplus truck that is a 2009 truck with only 900 miles and it’s got four-wheel drive,” Summerville said.
 After receiving multiple quotes, Summerville determined that to remodel the Army truck and add a tanker on to it, it would cost and could not exceed $140,000.
 “The current tanker holds approximately 2,000 gallons of water and this one would hold 3,000 gallons and we are looking forward to getting that built,” he said.
 Another key importance to the tanker would be that it would allow the department to drive the tanker while simultaneously pumping and spraying water.
 “We don’t have anything right now that you can pump water and drive at the same time,” Summerville said. “Out in the townships we serve, we take care of any kind of ditch fires along the fire tracks, which we commonly do. Any kind of those scenarios would be a good use of the tanker. It’s also good because there are less chances that the guys have to get out and pump on the roadside. It’s something that we would be really beneficial.”
 At the recent City Council meeting, council members voted to approve providing funding for this project.
 For the $140,000, $40,000 will come out of the capital outlay fund and the remaining balance will come out of the rural fire fund, City Administrator Renae Smith explained.
 Summerville said that the tanker is expected to be complete later this fall.

May 26, 2020 — On this date in 1998, North Dakota paleontologist John Hoganson received a telephone call from Kent Pelton, a teacher at Watford City High School. While fishing on Lake Sakakawea near New Town, Pelton had discovered what he thought were two mammoth tusks. Hoganson was excited, because very few remains of mammoths have ever been discovered here.
 A few days later, he traveled to Watford City to take a look. Pelton was storing the fossils in the school’s shop room, and when Hoganson walked in, he was at first confused by what he found. Nearby, he spotted a large bison skull that Pelton had also collected, and after a few minutes, Hoganson put two and two together. He realized the long curved pieces weren’t tusks; they were horn cores of a giant extinct ice age mammal called Bison latifrons.
 Hoganson says this was an even more exciting and scientifically important discovery than finding the remains of a mammoth. Prior to this, only one other specimen of this type of bison had been found in ND; in 1918, a horn core had been found near Independence School on the Fort Berthold Reservation.
 Hoganson, Pelton and several others immediately went by boat to the site where the bison bones had been found. There, Hoganson located several more pieces of the skull and some other bone fragments.
 The remains were on land administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers within the borders of the Fort Berthold Reservation. After several months of discussion, it was decided the Corps of Engineers would provide the funding to restore the bison skull for exhibit at the State Heritage Center in Bismarck. They also agreed to make several cast replicas for the Three Tribes Museum in New Town, the new Long X Visitors Center in Watford City, the Corps’ Riverdale office, the National Buffalo Museum in Jamestown and another is on display at the Missouri-Yellowstone Confluence Center near Williston.
 Tests revealed Pelton’s specimen was more than 47,500 years old. The animal was about 25-50% larger than modern-day bison, and its horns were dramatically different. Whereas today’s bison has a horn-span of about two feet, the latifrons – or “longhorn” – has a span of up to seven feet.
 Remains of the longhorn bison have been found primarily up and down the central corridor of the country, but it has also been discovered in Florida, the La Brea tar pits of California, the western mountain ranges and a few other spots. The specimen from North Dakota is farther north than any other found in the U.S., but two have also been found northwest in Canada.
 Hoganson says the longhorn bison lived a bit differently than today’s bison; it appears it wasn’t as social. Rather than traveling in herds, the latifrons’ habits more closely resembled those of the modern-day moose, which travels alone or in small groups. Most paleontologists also believe longhorn bison were browser-grazers that lived in woodlands or in forest openings, rather than on open grasslands.
 The first ice age mammal to be discovered in the state was a mammoth found on a ridge that once existed as the beach of Lake Agassiz; a geologist named Warren Upham discovered it in Cass County in 1895 while mapping Agassiz’s former boundaries. While discoveries of ice age mammals have been relatively scarce in North Dakota, paleontologists have also found remains of staghorn moose, mastodons, horses and the giant ground sloth, like the one in the movie “Ice Age.”

The Agreement’s greatest shortcoming lies, however, in leaving the ECT out of the picture. The ECT is the largest multilateral investment agreement covering a wide range of investments in the energy sector. About 45% of the pending Intra-EU ISDS claims are grounded in the ECT, notably including the renowned RES litigation brought against Italy, Spain, Czech Republic and Bulgaria, as well as the cases brought against Germany by Vattenfall and other utilities in reaction to the shutdown of nuclear power plants. More recently, German energy company Uniper has threatened to file an ECT claim against The Netherlands to seek compensation for the phase-out of its coal power plans enacted by the Dutch Parliament in December 2019. Hence, from the perspective of removing potential obstacles “chilling” the swift implementation of the European Green Deal, the big leap appears yet to be taken.

Should a person hear that a couple “tied the knot,” it’s immediately known that they got married. But just when and where does the term “tying the knot” come from?
 The phrase “tying the knot” is steeped in tradition, though the origins of the phrase remain open for debate. One origin story states that tying the knot can be traced back to the Roman empire, when brides wore girdles that were tied in knots, and the groom had to eventually untie those knots to consummate the marriage.
 Tying the knot also may be traced to the custom of handfasting. The marriage contract was established between a bride and a groom by joining their hands together and tying them. Although accounts vary as to whether the hands were tied only during the ceremony or later, this is believed to be an ancient Renaissance or Celtic tradition. Others speculate that the phrase traces its origins to Hindu weddings in which brides and grooms tied a necklace of flowers as part of wedding tradition. Yet another theory suggests that the phrase can be traced back to the knotted string that supported beds prior to the use of metal springs.
 Therefore, in order to make a marriage bed, couples first needed to tie the knot. Knots also represent a difficult-to-break bond, which is why they have long been associated with marriage. In one unity tradition, couples may braid or knot together three strands, with one representing the bride, one symbolizing the groom and the third representing God as they join together in faith. Similarly, the phrase “getting hitched” is associated with knot-tying as well. The saying implies that two people are being tied together just like a horse is tied, or hitched, to a wagon.
