Wolfe is a shearer by trade and a self-taught trainer who has Watch Me Dance as a $10 chance in the $1million Group 1 at Ascot on Saturday. Watch Me Dance last month became just the second filly in 61 years to win the Champion Fillies Stakes-WA Guineas double as she produced a thrilling win. Bookies have kept her safe in the Kingston Town Classic, noting the superb recent record of three-year-old fillies in the 1800m weight-for-age contest. Perfect Reflection was the first three-year-old filly to win the race, in 2015, but fillies have won it the last two years with Arcadia Queen in 2018 followed by Kay Cee last year. With the featherweight of 50kg and a good barrier (5) helping her cause, Wolfe reckons she will run a mighty race and favourite Inspirational Girl ($2.25) will have to run sizzling late sectionals to get past her. Watch Me Dance cost just $34,000 and has already banked almost $800,000 and is racing for a $590,000 first prize in the Kingston Town Classic. “She is the real deal,” Wolfe declared, after watching his filly work at Albany, 420km southeast of Perth, on Thursday morning. “She is a bloody exciting filly. “She has got fierce determination and I think that sets people apart and it also sets horses apart. “Those that want to win do win, and those that want to be successful are successful. “She doesn’t have to improve and they don’t come any better than her in terms of trying. “I firmly believe the further back she is in the run, the better she is, if you have a look at her early runs she was coming from last and swamping them. “Now she just jumps like a gazelle and I’d say she will be running fourth or fifth. “With our weight and with the easy run, Inspirational Girl will have to chop out pretty good sectionals late.” Wolfe says another of his horses, Red Can Man, who finished sixth behind Elite Street in the Group 1 Winterbottom last Saturday, will on Monday travel to Melbourne to be set for a campaign which hasn’t been determined at this stage. Wolfe is having the time of his life training horses and a Group 1 win would be the icing on the cake for the former shearer. “I worked on farms and ran a shearing team and then I taught myself about training horses, I learned what I could but I probably have got a lot to learn yet,” he says.“Shearing is a lot harder, training horses is the easiest caper in the world even though different owners might stress you a bit. “Everyone wants to be successful and sometimes you go through some lean runs and unfortunately you start to doubt yourself, but I’m sure all trainers are like that.”

The era of women being in political parties for the fun of organizing women to vote for men and to dance at campaigns must be a thing of the past if development must happen. The advocacy for gender parity can never be too much because given the population of the country and the poverty capital tag, the more competent and ready to serve women in politics, the better for the country. Women must be ready to go the whole hog because the men can never voluntarily give up power.

 # Top-ranked Jin Young Ko takes lead in LPGA Tour finale
 The Associated Press
 NAPLES, Fla. — Top-ranked Jin Young Ko took the lead into the weekend in the LPGA Tour’s CME Group Tour Championship, putting herself in position to win the season money title in only four events.
 Ko shot a 5-under 67 on Friday in chilly and breezy conditions at Tiburon Golf Club to take a one-stroke lead over defending champion Sei Young Kim and 2018 winner Lexi Thompson in the season-ending event.
 “Before when I play in KLPGA it was really cold, so I hate cold weather to play golf, but right now I love it,” said Ko, who spent most of the season in South Korea.
 The $1.1 million winner’s prize, down from $1.5 million last year, is the richest in women’s golf. Ko is 13th on the money list with $567,925. Inbee Park is the leader with $1,365,138, and Kim second with $1,207,438. Ko also is trying to hold off No. 2 Kim in the world ranking.
 “If play good I can do world ranking No. 1 still,” Ko said. “But if not and then she plays good, she can do. Doesn’t matter really.”
 Coming off a second-place tie last week in Houston in the U.S. Women's Open, Ko birdied three of four par-5 holes in a bogey-free round to reach 9 under.
 “I want bogey-free round next two days,” Ko said. “I’m looking forward to the weekend.”
 Kim had a 69. She has two victories this season.
 “Feel very solid in the morning because we got the strong wind,” Kim said. “My shot really solid. ... I’m very looking forward this weekend. Really exciting to chase the world ranking No. 1.”
 Thompson, the first-round leader after a 65, had two late birdies in a 71.
 “It was different conditions today of course with the cooler weather in the morning,” Thompson said. “I would say overall it was a lot breezier throughout the day. ... Wasn’t as good as yesterday of course, but overall happy and going to take the positives into the next two days.”
 Nelly Korda (66) was three strokes back at 6 under with Cydney Clanton (68), Austin Ernst (69), Georgia Hall (69), Megan Khang (71) and Caroline Masson (71).
 Lydia Ko was 5 under, following a 74 with a bogey-free 65.
 “I just wanted to play the best golf I can and not really think about my position and all that,” the New Zealander said. “I think that definitely helped, and I was able to do that pretty well.”
 Race to CME Globe leader Park was tied for 20th at 2 under after her second 71. Second-place Danielle Kang, playing alongside Park and Kim, was tied for 47th at 2 over after a 75. Kim. Kang led the points race since back-to-back wins in Ohio until Park took over the lead last week.
 Tiburon was the site of the PGA Tour’s QBE Shootout last week. In a normal year, the CME Group Tour Championship is held before Thanksgiving.

SAVANNAH, Ga. (WTOC) - Lawmakers are working to finalize a $900 billion coronavirus relief package. It could potentially include a $300 federal unemployment bonus.The Georgia Department of Labor is waiting for the next steps on the CARES Act.Georgia Department of Labor’s commissioner said the office is working with the state’s congressional delegation, as he has concerns about the future of the CARES Act.While Commissioner Mark Butler wouldn’t go into detail about what the new CARES Act could look like, he says he’s seen some of the provisions, calling it an “administrative nightmare.”If the bill passes, it will be up to the Department of Labor to figure out the logistics behind the new process. Essentially, however long it takes the Department of Labor to get a new system up and running, that’s how long unemployed Georgians will have to wait for their check.“If you’re trying to delay people’s payments, then pass the bill like you’re writing it because it’ll take us months and months just to do the programming for some of the stuff you’re talking about. They need to kind of just stick to what they’ve been doing and don’t come up with anything new,” Butler said.All federal CARES Act unemployment insurance programs are set to end on Dec. 31, but the GDOL encourages claimants continue to request benefits after the programs end in the event Congress passes new legislation or extends these programs.Copyright 2020 WTOC.

Another factor is the potentially shortened timeframe to effect solutions. January 20th is likely an important inflection point for Mr. Candeub and, thus, should be seen similarly for Verisign and ICANN as well. Ignoring NTIA's letter or trying to run out the clock would be myopic and risks drawing greater scrutiny from DOJ and others that could carry over into the next administration -- which isn't far-fetched considering the president-elect was Vice President when the 2012 price cap was imposed. Any expanded inquiry would necessarily seek to know the motives of two organizations that, on paper at least, have no interest, rights, or standing for these single-character names beyond the maximum allowable price of $7.85 -- in essence, it would become necessary to determine why ICANN and Verisign accepted such rapidly ballooning risk by seeking so mightily to deny the rights of others for something that they themselves hold no rights to whatsoever?

The horse is Black Duke, a striking black son of Melbourne Cup winner Fiorente.Litt won’t compare Black Duke with Castelvecchio, interestingly it’s one of his former stable star’s biggest rivals that comes to mind when the trainer looks into his crystal ball thinking of what lies ahead for Black Duke.“He’s got the makings of a good horse, a very, very good horse,” Litt said. “To me he’s a Shadow Hero-like horse. “He could be that type of horse, a good and tough style of gelding.”“A very appealing horse to the eye”, Black Duke has been a work in progress, recently gelded after a string raceday misdemeanours.“Last preparation his attitude let him down a lot, so we gelded him,” Litt said.“He would lash out getting in the truck, kick the walls down in the tie ups at the races, you couldn’t take him for a paddle or anything he was overdoing everything.“He was high revs all the time.“I ran him in the Dulcify and he only went fair that day but geez he had a bad day.“He went off in the truck, played up in the tie-up stalls and we couldn’t get his back shoes back on him, he was being a jerk to put it nicely.“He’s still got a bit of rubbish in him but in time I think he’ll put it behind him and the next six months he is going to mature into a really nice horse.” Black Duke made his first raceday appearance as a gelding in a 1000 metre three-year-old graduation at Warwick Farm where he reeling off the quickest last 800, 600 and 400m splits of the race to get within 1-1/2 lengths of the winner.On Saturday, he steps up to 1300m when he takes his place in a competitive three and four-year-old benchmark 72 handicap.“His run the other day was a quick turnaround from a trial and the main thing I wanted for the horse was for him to have a nice day out and get some confidence from the run,” Litt said.“They are all coming out of midweek grade on Saturday, but I think he’s stuck a tough race. I think the form will hold up well out of the race.“In his favour is he’s drawn one, he can just sit in behind them and doesn’t have to get too far back.“I think he’s screaming for the 1300 (metres).”Black Duke has been fancied in early betting, trimming in from $14 to $11 with TAB.com.au.Leading Sydney apprentice Tom Sherry retains the reins and reduces the weight impost to 54kg.Litt says Black Duke’s upcoming assignments will go a long way to steering the trainer into future assignments for the horse that is bred to get better as the distances increase. “If he can hold his own on Saturday it gives us something of an indication of where to look to at the end of his three-year-old season,” he said.“There’s Sydney in the autumn and we’ve also got Brisbane, which has some nice three-year-old races.“It’s a call we need to make sooner rather than later because there are a lot of nice races coming up and we need to decide which ones we are going to target so we can give the horse the best possible preparation for the races we choose.“There’s a lot of good races from March until the end of the season for a horse like this and I think the more he races, the better he’ll get.“How far he gets over ground-wise, I’m not sure, time will tell.“He’s quite brilliant. You don’t often see stayers figuring over 1000m like this horse did first-up but I don’t think it will hold him back from getting out to 2000 metres.“Further than 2000 metres, I don’t really know.”

Given the propensity of Verisign and ICANN to seek absolution in the loopholes of an obsolete legacy agreement, stakeholders might have a brighter future if they follow their lead and stop asking for what isn't in the .com Registry Agreement and get laser-focused on what is -- particularly those elements that a federal appellate ruling says "unlawfully restrain trade." In the meantime, NTIA's timely intervention reinforces the position taken by the IPC and others that the release of o.com -- along with the other remaining single-character .com names -- must be subject to the same procedures, policies and protections as every other newly available domain name.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. is adding a second COVID-19 vaccine to its arsenal.
 The Food and Drug Administration authorized emergency use Friday of the vaccine developed by Moderna and the National Institutes of Health.
 The decision comes days after health workers and nursing home residents began getting a similar coronavirus shot from Pfizer and BioNTech.
 Extra doses from a second vaccine are urgently needed, as U.S. deaths hit all- time highs and some hospitals are running out of beds.
 But even with additional candidates in the pipeline, there won’t be enough for the general population until spring, and shots will be rationed in the meantime.
