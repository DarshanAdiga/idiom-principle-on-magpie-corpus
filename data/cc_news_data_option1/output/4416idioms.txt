Ward officers may come, and ward officers may go, but encroachments go on forever.’ Tennyson’s ‘Brook’ may well have been a precursor to municipal corporations. A ward officer takes charge with the proverbial efficiency of a new broom, listens attentively to citizen complaints, orders department heads to deal ruthlessly with the deadly hug of HIG: hawkers, illegal structures and garbage. A flurry of activity ensues. But cork the bubbly rising in your hopeful breast. HIG has permanent occupancy of city streets, it sings a defiant ‘We shall not be moved’. The ward officer’s own rousing ‘We shall overcome’ begins to flag. It’s soon back to (non) business as usual courtesy the municipal team’s chalta hai attitude/own ‘take’ of the problem, political interference and the size and strength of HIG itself.

Favreau and executive producer Dave Filoni are walking a seriously teeny tightrope here, though. The closer _The Mandalorian_ gets to the core saga, the more risk they take of turning fan service into uncontrollable toxic fan rage. Holding out until the closing moments of this first 54 minute instalment shows restraint – though I do wish they’d held back even more by keeping Morrison with his back to the camera as Mando speeds by with his armour.
 There’s also the _Solo_ of it all. As the Screen Junkies Honest Trailer points out, no-one asked for the line where Han is assigned the name ‘Solo’ by a pompous Imperial Navy recruitment officer.

And Boba Fett is perhaps the classic example of the gaps in his timeline, whether filled in by comics like _Enemy of the Empire_ and _Bounty on Bar- Kooda_ or not, driving the mystery and the appeal to fans and, Disney no doubt notes, collectors. The coming weeks will reveal how precious Favreau and Filoni will be with the Boba Fett mythology. If we see more than 18 minutes of him, though, chances are they’ve made a mistake.
 The best evidence that _The Mandalorian_ season two isn’t veering too heavily into territory covered by the original trilogy is the 99 per cent of the first episode that doesn’t feature a character who may or may not be Boba Fett. Like the first series, it looks epic enough but more importantly it’s all refreshingly local, even though the action does take place in the ghost town of Mos Pelgo on Tatooine. Favreau is clearly having a lot of fun, verging almost into parody with his Beskar armour clinking and finger twitching in the saloon, I mean cantina.
 Our lone wolf Mando is enlisted by the aforementioned Marshall to take on a Krayt dragon that’s terrorising the town and eating unsuspecting banthas; his cub Baby Yoda barely makes a peep all episode. This _Dune_ -meets- _Moby Dick_ ‘slay the leviathan’ set piece is full of dust and sand and dragon bile, yet still manages to look beautiful thanks to Favreau’s eye for angles.
