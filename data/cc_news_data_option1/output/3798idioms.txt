Potenciar o uso do galego entre o alumnado do campus pontevedres e o obxectivo central do programa Falamos, impulsado pola Universidade de Vigo e o Concello de Pontevedra, que desde onte busca darse a coñecer entre a comunidade universitaria nos postos informativos que se iran instalando diante dos diferentes centros. Un ciclo de proxeccions e coloquios sobre peliculas, un club de lectura, un curso de cociña e un proxecto de voluntariado linguistico integran o programa de actividades, de caracter gratuito, desta iniciativa, nas que e posible inscribirse tanto a traves da web do programa como nos diferentes postos informativos.
 Os accesos as facultades de Ciencias Sociais e da Comunicacion e Belas Artes acolleron onte os postos desta iniciativa, resultado do traballo conxunto da Área de Normalizacion Linguistica da Universidade, o Servizo de Normalizacion Linguistica do Concello e grupo de preto de 15 persoas do que forman parte tanto estudantado como profesorado do campus. "Os indices de galegofalantes no campus son baixos", salientou o vicerreitor Jorge Soto na visita que realizou, xunto ao concelleiro de Normalizacion Linguistica, Alberto Oubiña, ao posto instalado diante de CCSS e da Comunicacion. Soto puña o acento deste xeito no informe realizado pola Universidade en 2018 e no que, no referido a sua lingua habitual, so o 18% das e os estudantes se definian como "monolingues en galego", fronte a un 64% en castelan.

In her new film "On the Rocks" -- premiering at the New York Film Festival on its way to AppleTV+ in October -- writer-director Sofia Coppola may well have crafted the quintessential Bill Murray role. But this is a father-daughter story, and the daughter is no less important; it helps, obviously, that both Coppola and Jones know a thing or two about larger-than-life dads, but it also matters that Jones is enough of a skilled actor and comic that she more than holds her own opposite the equally larger-than-life Murray.

To help some of the country's dirtiest electric-power plants save a little money, the Environmental Protection Agency is willing to imperil the lives and health of Americans who live downstream from them.
   
 A new rule that relaxes restrictions on ash pollution is the latest effort by President Donald Trump's administration to sustain coal power in the face of crushing competition from renewables. And like the others, it's sure to prove ineffective, wasteful and hugely damaging to the environment.
   
 The new action relaxes an Obama-administration effort to protect the water supply from mercury, arsenic, lead and other toxic components of coal ash. That rule had required plants to remove heavy metals from wastewater containing pollutants scrubbed from smokestacks and to use dry disposal methods to deal with the "bottom ash" from boilers rather than wash it away.
   
 The revision -- enacted under the EPA leadership of Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist -- weakens the wastewater cleaning requirements and allows plants to continue to flush some bottom ash.
   
 It also extends compliance deadlines until the last day of 2025, or the end of 2028 for plants that voluntarily adopt improved pollution-control technologies or promise to close or switch to natural gas by then.
   
 For the next eight years, in other words, coal ash will continue to be discharged into enormous, notoriously leaky holding pits and reservoirs, from which it will inevitably spill into rivers, streams and lakes, where the toxic metals will accumulate in fish and the ecosystem at large.
   
 Although it's hard to predict exactly how much damage this toxic pollution will cause, it is known to cause cancer, respiratory illnesses, neurological disorders and other diseases.
   
 Why take such an enormous risk? The EPA claims the revised rules will save the coal industry $140 million a year. That tradeoff would be hard enough to justify in its own right.
   
 But the agency doesn't even estimate how much power companies, or taxpayers, will ultimately have to pay to clean up the damage. The Tennessee Valley Authority spent six years and more than $1 billion to clean up and compensate for a 2008 ash spill into the Emory River; three dozen workers died of cancer and other diseases contracted in the process.
   
 This reform is all the more nonsensical because advances in treatment processes have made it easier than ever to discard coal ash more safely and to recycle the useful metals it contains.
   
 Nor will it do much to keep the coal industry alive. Bloomberg Green reports that coal, once the leading source of electricity in the U.S., is expected to provide just 18% of the total this year; it has long since been overtaken by natural gas and this year will be surpassed by renewable energy.
   
 Under Trump, the federal government has spent more than $1 billion trying to revive coal power -- yet plants just continue to close.
   
 Unfortunately, even after the last one is shuttered, coal ash will litter the American landscape for many years to come, menacing nature and threatening human health.
   
 Legal challenges may keep these revisions from taking effect immediately. But in the long run, the U.S. needs new management at the EPA that will place life and the environment above the interests of a dying industry.

The idea of holographic storage isn't exactly a new one but the time for it to take root may finally be here.

My Portuguese and Irish grandparents were born in some of the poorest places in Europe, came here hungry and determined and did OK for themselves. Eventually, they owned modest homes and small businesses, but first they toiled — on the docks in Oakland, on farms in Missouri — and they got their thin sliver of the American pie.
 By the time I was born, my people were no longer unwelcome foreigners — they were white. In our public schools, we celebrated the “melting pot” and “the land of opportunity” and were taught that anyone could succeed here, as long as you worked hard and caught a break once in a while. The books didn’t state it, but the mythology only applied if you were white.
 In the early days of this nation — as we broke free from England — being white meant that you were, well … English; your people came from England, along with a bit of Germany, a little Dutch, and other places the British monarchy had genetically invaded or absorbed.
 A caste system — influenced by how rich or poor each nation was in the 18th Century — had an impact on colonization. Spain, which once ruled the seas, had fallen on hard times and their people were dismissed as fit only to colonize the parts of the New World below the Rio Grande.
 In the 19th and 20th centuries, as the American Experiment shifted from a dependence on slave labor to a dependence on cheap labor, the definition of white became elastic, and began to include formerly shunned people from Southern and Eastern Europe, but still excluded everyone else.
 It began to fracture in the 1960s, and the Civil Rights Movement resulted in decent laws but poor enforcement, as our noble intentions were tarnished by the reality of our flaws.
 Our nation so often falls short of our dreams, and we’re supposed to appreciate that we keep dreaming, but I have a responsibility to examine my role in it, to wonder if it’s part of my indoctrination as a white man. Do I forgive the sins of my heritage by noting that my grandparents started poor and by believing that “As Americans, we mean well?”
 Essayists, pundits and authors refer to slavery as “America’s Original Sin.” I find that to be inarguable. The way white Americans have treated our African family — made them slaves, kept them down, seen them as “other” — is linked to how we have treated everyone we don’t see as white.
 Eurocentric hypocrisy is alive and well in the U.S.A. It’s a sad and abhorrent irony that we drove the First Nations people from their land and did all we could to subjugate them, and now apply a twisted mirror of that ruthless attitude to newcomers who want us to share what we took by force.
 I support the Black Lives Matter movement. Black people have suffered from the worst of our sins, and I hope a national reconciliation can transform that centuries-old stain on our hearts. When it does — and it must — everyone of us has to become an antiracist, because good intentions aren’t enough.
 Educator/activist Bettina Love says that white privilege is like an ATM card that keeps replenishing itself. She’s right, and it means that even the grandson of people who once didn’t fit the definition of white, now has the power to be a co-conspirator in anti-racism, in anti-homophobia, in anti- misogyny, in anti-anything that diminishes us as a human family.
 My privilege allows me — requires me — to speak up when I can, to intervene when I must, in service of a just and equitable future.
