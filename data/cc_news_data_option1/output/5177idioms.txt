No drama. Lots of talent.
 That was the theme Wednesday as Nebraska signed a 19-player recruiting class considered a top-25 group. By 10 a.m., each prospect had sent in their letter of intent.
 “I think we signed a really good class, a lot of pieces that are going to fit together with what we have,” NU coach Scott Frost said. “I think it’s going to be the key to getting us over the top. We just gotta continue to add talent and I feel like this group did that.”
 Frost called the 2021 haul “a little more of a regional class.” Five are from Nebraska. Nearly half are from the Midwest.
 In a pandemic year when no prospects had the benefit of an official visit, summer camps or in-person evaluations, coaches and players had to be creative and proceed — at least a little — on faith. Frost said there were a few signees he has yet to meet in person.

Then again, I asked several players in October how they felt relative to a typical year. To a man, they weren’t cognizant of any difference, though one player conceded that his mind must be tricking him. All were quick to point out that, when the season paused in March, no one stopped playing altogether. Pitchers threw. Hitters hit. Everyone stayed in playing shape, to a degree. From the middle of March to the beginning of June, there were no games to watch but no total break for the players. Some argued that 2020 was more of a mental challenge than a typical season because no one knew if or when they would be playing again. They just knew they had to stay ready.

 # The first COVID-19 vaccines are arriving in Wisconsin. Here's how you can help USA TODAY Network-Wisconsin report on their rollout.
 Madeline Heim
 USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin
 The pandemic's end is in sight.
 Thousands of COVID-19 vaccines arrived in Wisconsin on Tuesday, and by mid-day Wednesday, nearly 200 health care workers had been given their first shots, state health officials said.
 We still have a long way to go until life returns to normal. Vaccinating the state's 450,000-some health care workers and nursing home staff and residents, who make up the first group to receive the vaccine, could take a few months alone.
 Still, there's light at the end of the tunnel.
 USA TODAY Network-Wisconsin has covered the coronavirus since its early days, from concerns about testing and contact tracing, to hospitals straining at capacity during our fall surge, to personal stories of those who've lost their lives to the virus. Our coverage of the vaccine in the next few months will be no different — and we're asking for your help.
 What questions do you want answered before you get the vaccine yourself? If you're among the health care workers receiving the vaccine first, what was it like? Is your employer going to require that people be vaccinated to come back to the office? What are your concerns about who should get the shots first or who might choose not to get vaccinated?
 Tell us about it. You can fill out this survey, or contact reporter Madeline Heim directly at mheim@gannett.com.

Word of the settlement comes just a couple weeks before the COVID-delayed _Wonder Woman 1984_ debuts on HBO Max. The latest Wonder Woman epic will debut both on HBO Max and in theaters on Christmas Day, and it will mark HBO Max’s first 4K title. In addition to _Wonder Woman 1984_ , all of Warner Bros’s upcoming 2021 movies will land on HBO Max the same day they arrive in theaters.          Now that HBO Max is coming to Roku, the streaming service is finally available on all the major streaming platforms. Amazon’s Fire TV was one of the last holdouts, but Amazon and WarnerMedia reached their own agreement last month.          Prior to the deal, Roku users were essentially high and dry when it came to HBO Max, although they could cast HBO Max videos to their devices via AirPlay.          Besides its movie offerings, HBO Max is the streaming home of such HBO shows as _Game of Thrones, Big Little Lies, The Sopranos, Euphoria, Lovecraft County, Watchmen,_ and _Last Week Tonight_ , as well as such syndicated shows as _Friends_ and _The Big Bang Theory_.

 # Georgetown utility customers to see reduced electric bill starting February
 Claire Osborn
 Austin American-Statesman
 Georgetown utility customers will see a reduction in their bill starting in February.
 A residential customer whose monthly average consumption is 1,000 kilowatts, will see a reduction of $10, according to a news release from Georgetown.
 The reduction comes from a decrease in the power cost adjustment. The city had added the power cost adjustment to the bill to raise extra money because revenue from selling surplus energy from its wind and solar contracts fell short of its forecast.
 "The PCA (power cost adjustment) is a tool widely used by electric utilities to help recover costs above the projected budget," the release said. "The PCA charge is in addition to the regular charge per kilowatt hour for energy. The main energy charge, which for residential customers is $0.0958 per kilowatt hour, will remain the same."
 Georgetown Mayor Josh Schroeder said the city has "worked diligently in the past two years to improve the electric utility’s management and financial position,” said in a statement.
 “We are starting to see the positive results in the form of improved electric fund position, which lets us lower the PCA for our customers. Our work isn’t done, but I’m proud of the progress we’ve made and know we’ll continue to do everything we can to lessen the burden on our customers.”
 The release said the electric fund has recovered enough for the utility to be able to provide this rate relief to customers due to several steps the city has taken in the past two years, including:
 • Restructuring utility staff, including hiring a new general manager, Daniel Bethapudi.
 • Improving energy portfolio management practices, including consistent and disciplined risk-management practices outlined in the new risk management policy.
 • Bringing on better expertise to manage a complex energy portfolio. Shell Energy North America, Crescent Power and ACES Power work in collaboration with the electric utility staff to manage the energy portfolio.
 • Increasing focus on additional revenue streams and revenue assurance to improve the overall financial position. This work includes selling Renewable Energy Credits and better cost recovery related to infrastructure additions.
 • Adopting electric utility financial best practices that improved financial performance and flexibility.
 • Conducting a strategic review of electric utility business functions to identify opportunities for cost reductions. This review resulted in the sale of substation assets, which reduced overall operating costs and cash infusion.

"I was not killed, but what happened to me was absolutely chilling and I will live with it until my life is over," she testified.
 The next day, Coulibaly shot and killed a young policewoman after failing to attack a Jewish community center in the suburb of Montrouge. By then, the Kouachis were on the run and France was paralyzed with fear.
 Authorities didn't link the shooting to the massacre at Charlie Hebdo immediately. They were closing in on the Kouachis when the first alerts came of a gunman inside a kosher supermarket. It was a wintry Friday afternoon, and customers were rushing to finish their shopping before the Sabbath when Coulibaly entered, carrying an assault rifle, pistols and explosives. With a GoPro camera fixed to his torso, he methodically fired on an employee and a customer, then killed a second customer before ordering a cashier to close the store's metal blinds.
 The first victim, Yohan Cohen, lay dying on the ground and Coulibaly turned to some 20 hostages and asked if he should "finish him off." Despite their pleas, Coulibaly fired the killing shot, according to testimony from cashier Zarie Sibony.
 "You are Jews and French, the two things I hate the most," Coulibaly told them.
 Some 40 kilometers (25 miles) away, the Kouachi brothers were cornered in a printing shop with their own hostages. Ultimately, all three attackers died in near-simultaneous police raids. It was the first attack in Europe claimed by the Islamic State group, which struck Paris again later that year to even deadlier effect.
 "This is the end of a trial that's been crazy, illuminating, painful but which has been useful," said Richard Malka, a lawyer for Charlie Hebdo.
 Prosecutors said the Kouachis essentially self-financed their attack, while Coulibaly and his wife took out fraudulent loans. Boumeddiene, the only woman on trial, fled to Syria days before the attack and appeared in Islamic State propaganda.
 One witness, the French widow of an Islamic State emir, testified from prison that she'd run across Boumeddiene late last year at a camp in Syria and Boumeddiene's foster sisters said they believed she was still alive. Testifying as a free man after a brief prison term, for reasons both defense attorneys and victims described as baffling, was the far-right sympathizer turned police informant who actually sold the weapons to Coulibaly.
 Three weeks into the trial, on Sept. 25, a Pakistani man steeped in radical Islam and armed with a butcher's knife attacked two people outside Charlie Hebdo's vacated offices.
 Six weeks into the trial, on Oct. 16, a French schoolteacher who opened a debate on free speech by showing students the Muhammad caricatures was beheaded by an 18-year-old Chechen refugee.
 Eight weeks into the trial, on Oct. 30, a young Tunisian armed with a knife and carrying a copy of the Quran attacked worshippers in a church in the southern city of Nice, killing three. He had a photo of the Chechen on his phone and an audio message describing France as a "country of unbelievers."

“At some point you have to face the music,” Sen. John Thune of South Dakota said. “And I think once the Electoral College settles the issue today, it’s time for everybody to move on.” Similarly, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas let us know that he thinks Biden is “president-elect subject to whatever additional litigation is ongoing. I’m not aware of any.”                                                       It is refreshing to see Republican lawmakers finally yield to reality. Still, there’s something concerning about each of these statements. That something was also there in Sen. Lamar Alexander’s interview with Chuck Todd of “Meet the Press” on Sunday. Asked whether he had “any doubt who won the election,” the outgoing Tennessee senator answered, “Shouldn’t be after Monday. The states have counted, certified their votes. The courts have resolved the disputes. It looks very much like the electors will vote for Joe Biden.”                                                                                                                                                                     The “something” is the idea that this past month of litigation (and angry outbursts and demanding phone calls with election officials) was somehow _normal_ , that the “constitutional process” for presidential elections includes potential judicial override, that the Supreme Court weighs in on challenges to the outcome, and that everything is provisional until the Electoral College cast its votes, as if that process is anything more than a formality.                                                       To affirm Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as the winners of the election more than a month after the end of voting — as Mitch McConnell did, on Tuesday morning, when he announced that “our country officially has a president-elect and vice-president elect” — is to treat the outcome as unofficial pending an attempt to overturn the result.                                                                                                              In short, Republicans are establishing a new normal for the conduct of elections, one in which a Democratic victory is suspect until proven otherwise, and where Republicans have a “constitutional right” to challenge the vote in hopes of having it thrown out.                                                       We’ve already seen this spread to down-ballot races. Sean Parnell, a Republican House candidate, refused to concede his race against the Democratic incumbent, Conor Lamb, citing voter fraud and signed onto a lawsuit, since dismissed, to throw out mail-in ballots. “I will continue to fight and follow the constitutional process until every legal vote is counted and all legal proceedings are resolved,” he said, more than a week after Lamb declared victory.                                                       John James, the Republican candidate for the Senate in Michigan, took a similar stance. “While Sen. Peters is currently ahead, I have deep concerns that millions of Michiganders may have been disenfranchised by a dishonest few who cheat,” James said, days after voting ended with the incumbent Democrat, Gary Peters ahead. James did not concede until the end of the month.                                                       One rejoinder is that Democrats have played this game too. In 2018, Stacey Abrams took 12 days to end her campaign for Georgia governor. Her opponent, Brian Kemp, had also administered the election as secretary of state. In the years before, his office had improperly purged hundreds of thousands of voters from the rolls and closed polling stations in predominantly Black areas throughout the state. His was a slim victory, and Abrams held out on a concession to call attention to Kemp’s clear conflict of interest.                                                                                        You see, despite a record high population in Georgia, more than 1 million citizens found their names stripped from the rolls by the Secretary of State, including a 92 year-old civil rights activist who had cast her ballot in the same neighborhood since 1968. Tens of thousands hung in limbo, rejected due to human error and a system of suppression that had already proven its bias. The remedy, they were told, was simply to show up — only they, like thousands of others, found polling places shut down, understaffed, ill-equipped or simply unable to serve its basic function for lack of a power cord.                                                       Abrams did not dismiss the election as “rigged” because there were more voters than she would have preferred. She did not call on judges to subvert the outcome or throw out Republican votes. She admitted defeat, but refused to concede that hers was a free and fair election. Contrast that with President Donald Trump, whose _complaint_ is that he had to compete in a free and fair election, and whose definition of “fraud” is a level electoral playing field.                                                       Following the president’s lead, some Republicans, under the guise of so-called election integrity, are even retreating from popular government itself. After Kemp’s successor as secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, refused to bend to demands to subvert the vote for the president, the speaker of the Georgia House of Representatives, David Ralston, announced that he would seek a state constitutional amendment to take the office away from voters and put it in the hands of the Georgia Legislature. His counterpart in Michigan, another swing state, has even floated his support for doing the same with presidential electors.                                                       Ongoing debates over coups and fascism and despotism, all keyed to foreign examples, miss the extent to which American history itself offers many examples of democratic backsliding — not into outright autocracy but into forms of competitive authoritarianism or herrenvolk democracy, in which only those designated as the rightful “people” have a legitimate say in government. Perhaps we should be looking less at whether the United States is on the path to authoritarianism and more at whether it’s moving away from the broad-based democratic aspirations of the postwar period back toward the narrow, restrictive democracy of the years between the end of Reconstruction and the crisis of the 1930s.

 But the draw kept the Rossoneri top of the Serie A standings with 28 points and continued their unbeaten run in the league this season, although neighbours Inter Milan are just one point behind in second after beating Napoli.
 Genoa moved above Torino into 18th place, but they remain three points adrift of safety.
 The game was a slow burner until Destro pounced on a Gianluigi Donnarumma parry to tap in from close range and open the floodgates to a goal-filled second half.

They then lost by 21,000.  That has to date been enough to push litigation by and large out of British electoral politics, at least as far as the counting of votes is concerned.

SEATTLE (AP) — In one corner of the second floor at the Seattle Kraken’s future training center sits the office of the general manager, complete with a view of the primary practice rink below. It’s a space Ron Francis will become very familiar with sometime in the summer of 2021 when that portion of the facility is completed. But for now it’s a space Francis has yet to set foot in. He's only seen the office where he’ll put together the first Kraken roster in photos and videos. “I see an awful lot of pictures in our Zoom meetings and stuff, and it’s incredible the progress they’ve made,” Francis said. “It’s looking like something really exciting. But I’m looking forward to being able to see it in person for sure.” Francis was last in Seattle in February. Since then, the Kraken GM has been at his home in North Carolina creating the framework for the team that will take the ice sometime next fall. “To this point it’s worked as well as we could hope it has,” Francis said. “Certainly, we look forward to the day when we’re all sitting in the same room and can have a face-to-face conversation.” This month marked two years since Seattle was awarded its expansion NHL franchise. The anniversary was observed with small acknowledgements, with the organization focusing more attention on the countdown to the expansion and league drafts likely happening next summer. The uncertainty over the timing of those events has only underscored the importance of Seattle's decision to bring Francis on board earlier than most expected. He was hired in summer 2019 and it now seems like a stroke of genius by team CEO Tod Leiweke. “If we had been a little more traditional with our hiring process we would have been scrambling because the season got completely...

Serge Aurier has shown himself to be capable of making errors with worrying regularity during his time in England. Unsurprisingly, many thought that Aurier’s run in the Spurs starting lineup would come to an end with the summer signing of Matt Doherty from Wolves.
 However, the Ivorian has raised his game admirably in this campaign, taking advantage of every opportunity given to him in the Spurs side this season. Aurier seems to have reclaimed the right-back spot from his Irish teammate for the time being.
 Unfortunately for Spurs, it was the error-prone Aurier of old rather than this season’s solid, tough-tackling, and dependable version that took to the field against Liverpool. He found himself in all sorts of trouble virtually from the first whistle.
 Aurier seemed all at sea when up against the trickery of Sadio Mane, the overlapping runs of Andy Robertson, and the well-timed advances of Curtis Jones. He was caught out of position time and again by Liverpool’s attack- minded players.
 Were it not for the defensive cover afforded to him by Moussa Sissoko, Aurier could have found himself in serious trouble as he struggled to cope with Mane throughout the game. The latter seemed to be able to go past him with relative ease on multiple occasions.

PARIS (AP) — The fugitive widow of an Islamic State gunman and a man described as his logistician were convicted Wednesday of terrorism charges and sentenced to 30 years in prison in the trial of 14 people linked to the January 2015 Paris attacks against the satirical Charlie Hebdo newspaper and a kosher supermarket.The verdict ends the three-month trial linked to the three days of killings across Paris claimed jointly by the Islamic State group and al-Qaida. During the proceedings, France was struck by new attacks, a wave of coronavirus infections among the defendants, and devastating testimony bearing witness to bloodshed that continues to shake France.Patrick Klugman, a lawyer for the survivors of the market attack, said the verdict sent a message to sympathizers. “We accuse the executioner but ultimately it is worse to be his valet,” he said.All three attackers died in police raids. The widow, Hayat Boumeddiene, fled to Syria and is believed to still be alive. The two men who spirited her out of France are thought to be dead, although one received a sentence of life in prison just in case and the other was convicted separately.Eleven others were present and all were convicted of the crime, with sentences ranging from 30 years for Boumeddiene and Ali Riza Polat, described as the lieutenant of the virulently anti-Semitic market attacker, Amédy Coulibaly, to four years with a simple criminal conviction. The Jan. 7-9, 2015, attacks in Paris left 17 dead along with the three gunmen. The 11 men standing trial formed a loose circle of friends and criminal acquaintances who claimed any facilitating they may have done was unwitting.One gambled day and night during the three-day period, learning what had happened only after emerging blearily from the casino. Another was a pot- smoking ambulance driver. A third was a childhood friend of the market attacker, who got beaten to a pulp by the latter over a debt.It was the coronavirus infection of Polat that forced the suspension of the trial for a month.Polat’s lawyer, Isabelle Coutant-Peyre, described him as a scapegoat who knew nothing about Coulibaly’s plans. She said he would appeal.“He knew from the beginning it was a fictional trial,” she said afterward.In all, investigators sifted through 37 million bits of phone data, according to video testimony by judicial police. Among the men cuffed behind the courtroom’s enclosed stands, flanked by masked and armed officers, were several who had exchanged dozens of texts or calls with Coulibaly in the days leading up to the attack. Also testifying were the widows of Chérif and Saïd Kouachi, the brothers who stormed Charlie Hebdo’s offices on Jan. 7, 2015, decimating the newspaper’s editorial staff in what they said was an act of vengeance for its publication of caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad years before. The offices had been firebombed before and were unmarked, and editors had round-the-clock protection. But it wasn’t enough. In all, 12 people died that day. The first was Frédéric Boisseau, who worked in maintenance. Then the Kouachis seized Corinne Rey, a cartoonist who had gone down to smoke, and forced her upstairs to punch in the door code. She watched in horror as they opened fire on the editorial meeting.“I was not killed, but what happened to me was absolutely chilling and I will live with it until my life is over,” she testified.The next day, Coulibaly shot and killed a young policewoman after failing to attack a Jewish community center in the suburb of Montrouge. By then, the Kouachis were on the run and France was paralyzed with fear. Authorities didn’t link the shooting to the massacre at Charlie Hebdo immediately. They were closing in on the Kouachis when the first alerts came of a gunman inside a kosher supermarket. It was a wintry Friday afternoon, and customers were rushing to finish their shopping before the Sabbath when Coulibaly entered, carrying an assault rifle, pistols and explosives. With a GoPro camera fixed to his torso, he methodically fired on an employee and a customer, then killed a second customer before ordering a cashier to close the store’s metal blinds. The first victim, Yohan Cohen, lay dying on the ground and Coulibaly turned to some 20 hostages and asked if he should “finish him off.” Despite their pleas, Coulibaly fired the killing shot, according to testimony from cashier Zarie Sibony.“You are Jews and French, the two things I hate the most,” Coulibaly told them. Some 40 kilometers (25 miles) away, the Kouachi brothers were cornered in a printing shop with their own hostages. Ultimately, all three attackers died in near-simultaneous police raids. It was the first attack in Europe claimed by the Islamic State group, which struck Paris again later that year to even deadlier effect. “This is the end of a trial that’s been crazy, illuminating, painful but which has been useful,” said Richard Malka, a lawyer for Charlie Hebdo.Prosecutors said the Kouachis essentially self-financed their attack, while Coulibaly and his wife took out fraudulent loans. Boumeddiene, the only woman on trial, fled to Syria days before the attack and appeared in Islamic State propaganda.One witness, the French widow of an Islamic State emir, testified from prison that she’d run across Boumeddiene late last year at a camp in Syria and Boumeddiene’s foster sisters said they believed she was still alive. Testifying as a free man after a brief prison term, for reasons both defense attorneys and victims described as baffling, was the far-right sympathizer turned police informant who actually sold the weapons to Coulibaly. Three weeks into the trial, on Sept. 25, a Pakistani man steeped in radical Islam and armed with a butcher’s knife attacked two people outside Charlie Hebdo’s vacated offices.Six weeks into the trial, on Oct. 16, a French schoolteacher who opened a debate on free speech by showing students the Muhammad caricatures was beheaded by an 18-year-old Chechen refugee.Eight weeks into the trial, on Oct. 30, a young Tunisian armed with a knife and carrying a copy of the Quran attacked worshippers in a church in the southern city of Nice, killing three. He had a photo of the Chechen on his phone and an audio message describing France as a “country of unbelievers.” Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

And I and the trying to get this done very quickly but I should make it very clear this is not a done deal just yet things are still changing. And it is a very fast moving story so right now where it is though it's about a 900 billion dollar bill that's the compromise number. The Democrats and Republicans and agreed to you the things that includes willing deadbeat checks directly to Americans somewhere in the range of 600 to 700 dollars. That was a big thing that came through just in the last couple of days some senators insisting. That Americans get money directly from the federal government the other big thing of course is that extension of 300 dollars a week in unemployment insurance benefits. That will go for several more months. But again 900 billion dollars all still very much in the works negotiations continue.

Georgia has been in the same boat as every other college program in recruiting for the 2021 cycle. Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic put the sports world on pause, in-person recruiting, campus visits and trips to prospects' schools and homes have been non-existent. The on-field product has returned, but the NCAA dead period has continued, and is current locked in through mid-April 2021.
 The Bulldogs have relied on Zoom video calls, film evaluation and virtual methods of recruiting over the past nine-plus months. A Smart-led program is one that recruits successfully based on physical tours of facilities, elaborate official visit meals and face-to-face interaction. Everything has flipped, and Georgia rounded out its class with the potential that some signees didn't visit campus.
 Different circumstances, similar result for Georgia.
 Smart, known for his top-rated recruiting classes, did it again. As of Wednesday afternoon, Georgia has the No. 3 class nationally, after having the top-rated class in the 2020 cycle.
 It didn't come without its challenges, though.
 "I have run out of creativity," Smart said Monday. "There's probably people a lot smarter than me out there because I can't figure out what the next cutting-edge item is because we just do real talk at this point -- get on the phone and talk on the phone like normal people and FaceTime and Zoom. There's nothing left outside of the box."
 Georgia's class is headlined by a quartet of five-stars -- Sorey Jr., quarterback Brock Vandagriff, outside linebacker Smael Mondon and offensive tackle Amarius Mims. Eighteen prospects have signed their official paperwork, and the Bulldogs can add more prospects this week or again in the February period that starts with the traditional National Signing Day.
 Some of Georgia's signees have been tied to the program for quite some time, such as Vandagriff, cornerback David Daniel and running back Lovasea Carroll. They helped in recruiting efforts to pitch the program, based off of pre- pandemic experiences, to those who signed after March. Some of those later additions include wide receiver Jackson Meeks and four-star defensive tackle Tyrion Ingram-Dawkins.
 "I would say it's very hard for a recruit. Taking trips and being able to be around coaches and players had a big impact on me in terms of knowing which school I wanted to go to," Georgia starting safety Lewis Cine said. He indicated that there's a higher unpredictability in whether the prospect's decision will work out due to the altered methods of communication. "I don't feel like talking on Zoom or a video call that you get the feel for anything. You're just talking on the phone and not in that environment. That makes it harder for them."
 Since March, Smart has made it clear that recruits were getting bombarded -- via phone or virtually -- by college coaches. They came at a higher volume than usual because it only took a few touches of a button. Georgia has found out that prospects are tired of playing the waiting game. They're done with virtual communication, including taking high school classes online. Smart said most of the prospects want to be mid-year enrollees as a result, but the numbers game complicates it due to how many open scholarships Georgia has available for players to join early.
 Georgia's current players also are tired of Zoom, and they have more in-person interaction than a recruit would. These high school prospects are having to trust in relationships largely built over a computer screen.
 For older players who built long-standing relationships, met coaches at showcase events and more, it's tougher to put the so-called pandemic class into perspective.
 "It would be hard as a recruit right now in these times," senior offensive guard Ben Cleveland said. "I can't imagine being a high-school kid trying to build those relationships over Zoom calls. I feel like our coaches do have a hold of it and can take advantage of those circumstances."
 Aside from a creative video wrinkle, Georgia hasn't changed much in its recruiting approach. As Wednesday progressed, it brought the same result.
 The Bulldogs recruited as usual.
 "I would think that every one of these kids had been here at some point in time," Smart said. "We'd been face-to-face with everyone."

But here is a companion fact that too many newsrooms seem unaware of—or, worse, ignore: it’s not just activists who talk about a “climate emergency.” As this column has mentioned more than once, more than eleven thousand leading scientists have expressly chosen the phrase “climate emergency” to describe the situation currently facing our civilization. Skeptical journalists should bear in mind that scientists tend to be data-driven, rationally inclined individuals who generally shun emotionally charged words. Scientists are embracing the phrase “climate emergency” now because the physical realities have become so extreme, the time remaining to fix the problem so limited, and the necessary reforms so difficult that no other words suffice. Humanity must slash emissions by 45 percent by 2030 to avoid utter catastrophe, UN scientists have warned, which will require transforming the world’s energy, agriculture, finance, and other key sectors at a pace and scale unprecedented in history.

Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was bemused by a verbal attack by Tottenham manager Jose Mourinho after Roberto Firmino earned his side a dramatic 2-1 win at Anfield. Spurs had chances to end Liverpool's long unbeaten Premier League record on home soil, but Harry Kane missed a sitter before he allowed Firmino to find space in the box and head home a 90th minute clincher.Mohamed Salah's deflected first half show and Son Heung-min's equaliser set the game up for a thrilling second half, with Liverpool finding a way to win.The game finished with Mourinho exchanging words with Klopp on the touchline, with the Spurs boss accusing his rival of what he considered to be &quot;bad behavior&quot; on the touchline.&quot;If I behave the same way he does on the touchline, I do not stay there. That's animated? For some reason I am different. That is the only thing I say,&quot; stated Mourinho.&quot;Everything is fine between us. The referees let him behave the way he does. It's not my problem. I feel sad for it because I can not do it but it's just the way it is.&quot;&quot;I told him (Klopp) the best team lost and he disagreed, but that's his opinion.&quot;Klopp admitted he was confused by Mourinho's accusations, as he offered up his verdict on a big win for his champions.&quot;I don't know what he means,&quot; stated Klopp, when the suggestion that his behaviour on the touchline was questionable.&quot;He said to me, the best team lost. Nothing serious, he said it himself so I don't have to repeat it. No argument.&quot;Overall it was a good game against a counter-attacking monster, the possession we had we did incredibly well. Yes they have scored a goal, had two chances, apart from that we controlled the game and it is a massively deserved three points and I am happy.&quot;For me, it is offside (the Spurs goal). They watch it 20 times, but when I saw it, it is offside. There is nobody to blame, the best way to defend Tottenham is to keep the ball all the time.&quot;It was just a really good game and I am so happy we scored that goal because it felt like 70% of the ball against a top side. Bobby (Firmino), what a header, I am over the moon for him. What a game he played, those movements, he opens up all the other gaps.&quot;Meanwhile, Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson hailed his side's performance as the best of their season so far.&quot;It was a good game, very tactical, probably what you expect in terms of us dominating with the ball, creating chances and getting done on the counter. Overall the performance was outstanding,&quot; he said.&quot;We concentrate on keeping going until the final whistle goes. I am delighted with the lads. We deserved the three points. One of our best performances of the season.&quot;We focus on ourselves. It might give them a dent but it is more about us. Our focus has to be on the weekend against Palace.&quot;

ATLANTA (CNN) - Delta is opening a “quarantine-free” travel corridor for flights from the U.S. to Amsterdam and Rome.However, to get on board, passengers first underwent abundant testing.Passengers headed to Amsterdam on Delta flight 76 began their journey about 5 days earlier. They took the first of several COVID-19 tests that enabled them to avoid quarantining when they arrived the following morning.A first test is followed by a rapid test at the Atlanta airport before boarding. If they are both negative, then the passengers are free to fly.The passengers take a third test upon arrival in Amsterdam, and only if that it is negative can they avoid quarantine.“It’s really the idea of stacking tests, or sequential testing, to try and capture any of those individuals that either falsely tested negative initially and/or converted in the 3-day period since they had their initial test perform. So, it’s just another layer of protection,” said Dr. Stefen Ammon, the emergency physician and medical director at DispatchHealth.Building COVID-19 corridors is part of the airline industry’s effort to restore confidence and revive air travel, by eliminating the need for time-consuming quarantine.“We’re hoping that in the first quarter of next year we’ll also be able to have more cities,” said Perry Cantarutti, senior vice president of alliances and international for Delta.There are similar corridors from Rome to New York, and soon Atlanta to Rome.Currently, the number of passengers on these flights is limited because of both EU and U.S. travel restrictions in place banning each other’s citizens from non-essential travel.Delta Airlines isn’t alone. All the major transatlantic carriers are experimenting with corridors of one sort or another, but their success depends on governments giving permission.All in all, these individual flights are a glimmer of hope at a new normal, a safer way of air travel in the coronavirus era.Copyright 2020 CNN Newsource.

In a recent video posted to his official congressional Facebook account, Congressman Bill Huizenga attempted to justify joining a lawsuit that seeks to throw out millions of votes, including in his own state.
   
 The short response is this: If, as the Congressman suggests, the entire Texas suit as far as Michigan is concerned is based in the absentee ballot application mailing, it's mooted by a state Court of Appeals decision in September. He can disagree, but it's not his call. And it's not a U.S. constitutional question for SCOTUS to settle between Michigan and Texas.
   
 That the court ultimately rejected the case doesn't let Huizenga off the hook. He sent a message by signing on. Message received.
      
 Beyond that, I have to say, I've ever been angrier with the congressman or more ashamed of him. He should be utterly ashamed of himself. At best, he is a coward, acting out of fear of Trump and Trump supporters. But the evidence suggests he is a willful participant in a plot against the American people. He is seeking to overturn the will of the voters of Michigan and he is openly admitting it, saying the "remedy" would be for the GOP-led state legislature to select its own slate of electors for the Electoral College. On that basis, he is forever unfit for the office he holds.
   
 The damage this does to the Republic is breathtaking and possibly permanent. The amicus brief refers to "the confidence of our people in the legitimacy of our institutions of government." Republican participation in Trump's toxic tooth-and-nail refusal to accept that he lost is the primary reason for the "erosion in that foundation."
   
 If there is a civil war in the next decade, the actions of Republicans over the past month will be one of the major reasons why. Countries where the losers of elections refuse to accept the results are not known for political stability. Political violence may even flare up in the coming weeks as the current president's continued refusal to accept reality inflames his heavily armed followers. Already we have armed protests at the homes of election officials who simply did their job. That makes what Huizenga has done akin to incitement to sedition.
   
 It's now an open question whether this broken trust in our elections, with the routine acceptance of a political loss, will ever fully return. And that puts the future of this democratic republic in doubt.
   
 This election was a leadership test. By professing his fealty to the loser instead of the Republic, thereby giving new life to the false belief that the 2020 election was fraudulent, Congressman Huizenga has failed the test.
   
 He should resign immediately.

 # Abilene mayor going to Washington state? Not so fast.
 Our view
 Abilene Reporter-News
 View Comments
 Well, that certainly was news out of the blue.
 Anthony Williams, Abilene's newly re-elected mayor, confirmed Saturday that he is one of three finalists for the manager's job for the City of Bainbridge Island, Washington.
 As changes go, that would be a big one for him if he were named the sole finalist and accepted a job offer.
 He's a Cowboys fan ... has the team's demise sent him longing for another team to cheer?
 To us, this scenario playing out with the Abilene native leaving Texas, seems like a long shot.
 That is not speaking ill of his qualifications. Williams is a proven leader.
 It just doesn't fit.
 First, Williams ran again because there was more work ahead for the city. Abilene, like other cities, must dig out of the hole created by a health pandemic that slowed momentum.
 Amid the health crisis came the issue of race, which has bubbled to the surface since Councilman Kyle McAlister's social media posts came to light in January 2019. Williams said race was at the top of his shortlist of what to address in his final three years.
 Secondly, he has been positioning himself as a candidate for politics beyond Abilene. It is expected that when districts are redrawn post-census, there will be more opportunity for leadership.
 It's no secret that Williams has been aligning himself with the Republican party. As a successful Black leader, he would be an attractive candidate who would help the party in its diversity goals.
 Third, Bainbridge Island is not Taylor County.
 It's a ritzy area sprung from strawberry fields. It's 90% white and 0.6% black. The median house value is $705,000. The median household income is $118,000
 The 2018 poverty rate is under 5%.
 Abilene, by comparison, is 72% white and 10.6% Black. The median house value is $120,400. The median household income is under $51,000.
 The population difference is almost 100,000, Abilene being much larger.
 Two different places, not even considering Bainbridge Island being surrounded by water and Williams coming from a place where water security always is a concern.
 Williams has made it clear that raising the economic bar in Abilene includes helping those living in zip codes that face great poverty. He has a heart for those folks.
 Yet, he made a point. A mayor is not paid, which is why everyone should appreciate the hours our elected leaders put in. They are council and board volunteers. So to be on the lookout for a career change is not without reason. Williams has just crested age 50, so there is a lot of mileage left on the vehicle.
 He said it would take a lot to move 1,900 miles from where he was born and raised. And even farther from Anthony and Lynette Williams' first grandchild.
 Obviously, a winter departure — a Bainbridge decision, Williams said, would come in early or mid-January — would shake things up locally.
 We'd need another mayor's race, and the composition of the council could dramatically change.
 But that's getting ahead of ourselves.
 We expect him to stay put. Being named one of three finalists among 70 candidates for this job is a gold star on his resume, and the news made headlines. It's good that those folks in the Northwest recognize a leader in West Texas.
 As 2020 has taught, stranger things have happened.
 But we expect Anthony Williams to still be mayor at home next Christmas.

"And do you need to wear a mask? Absolutely yes. And the reason for that is we're not really out of the woods until we have enough of the community immune, either through natural immunity or through the vaccine immunity, so that we stopped the community spread until that time and I suspect that will be spring or summer," she said. "We're going to still have to wear our masks, do our distancing clean surfaces, all the things that we know that we need to do."
