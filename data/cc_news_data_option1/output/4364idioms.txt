Mantachie High School traveled west to Senatobia to face Magnolia Heights. The Mustangs were unable to get their offense into a rhythm on the road and lost 37-0.
 Mantachie received the opening kick but was forced to punt on a fourth-and- nine. A bad snap resulted in the punter barely able to get the kick off. The punter got the kick off, but it was short. The Chiefs opened their drive in Mustang territory and were driving when the Mustang defense forced a fumble and senior Ross Simpson recovered it to give their offense the ball in good position. Flags set up long yardage situations, at best, and, at worst, negated a couple of big plays. The Mustangs were held to a third and long and forced to punt. The return man bobbled it, and the Mustangs recovered the ball. They gave it right back to the Chiefs a few plays later, and the home team turned it into seven points. The score stood at 7-0, Magnolia Heights at the end of the first.
 The Mantachie defense played maybe their most complete set of downs of the night in the second quarter. Magnolia Heights had it first-and-goal at the five-yard line. The Mustangs kept them out of the end zone and forced a 28-yard field goal attempt. The kick was good, but the defense held their ground in the trenches to keep the Chiefs out of the end zone.
 Magnolia Heights went up 17-0 at the break and a touchdown on their opening drive took the wind from the Mustangs sails.
 The offense struggled throughout the night. The Chiefs seemed to have an answer on defense for every play drawn up by the Mustangs. Senior Patrick Mangels, while kept out of the end zone, had a nice night. The highlight was a long run of about 30 yards in the second quarter that would have given the Mustangs a first-and-ten in Chief territory. Instead, a penalty negated much of the yardage.
 Magnolia Heights picked up the 37-0 win.
 Friday night, the Mustangs are on the road in their regular season finale, and an important 1-2A game, at Walnut. The game will decide the playoff seeding of both schools.

It seems very clear to us that lines are being drawn within the Keyser City Council and it is now more important that ever for our city officials to step up and fill the seat that has been vacant since William Zacot resigned in early September.   According to the city charter, when a council member resigns or can no longer serve for some reason, it is up to the mayor to appoint someone who must then be approved by a majority of the council.   Mayor Damon Tillman chose not to appoint anyone at the Sept. 23 meeting, however, and instead put out a plea for anyone willing to serve to send in a letter of interest by the Oct. 14 meeting.   There were two letters received and again the decision was delayed supposedly because one member of the council was absent that night due to medical reasons and another, Jennifer Junkins, had to recuse herself because one of the letter writers was her husband.   First of all, while we applaud their effort to determine any interest in serving the city, the city officials are not following the charter as it outlines the process of filling a vacant seat.   Again, it is up to the mayor to appoint someone, and the council to approve his appointee.   We admit this may not be an easy task with the current mayor and council, as they have not exactly been on the same page with some of the issues here lately, including the recent discussion of the police department and dispatch.   We want to add, however, that we wouldn't want the council to be, as the mayor said the other day, "a bunch of bobble heads sitting up there." Differing opinions and honest discussion can be beneficial to city governments, as long as the differences don't become insurmountable or rife with personal agendas.   For that very reason, however, it is important to have every seat filled so the elected officials can more effectively consider varying options in order to do their job.   We would encourage mayor Damon Tillman to go ahead and make an appointment during Wednesday's meeting. Someone that he feels will serve selflessly, honestly, and with dedication to doing what is right for the people of Keyser.   There has to be a lot of people out there like that who may not have thought about sending in a letter, but who would step up if approached with the idea.

The scholarship currently offers $1,000 a semester to students at Bowling Green High School, which is Haynes’ alma mater.
 BGHS graduate Dylan Jackson was recently named as the scholarship’s inaugural recipient.
 On behalf of his school, BGHS Principal Kyle McGraw said he appreciated White’s generosity and that “hopefully this generosity can help students for years to come.”
 White said she plans to eventually expand the scholarship to any student in the city or county school system who’s participated in their school’s band for at least three years. She’s arranged to create an endowed scholarship with WKU’s College Heights Foundation as part of her estate plans, she said.
 “We’re excited that this scholarship will provide opportunities for education for students that may not have otherwise been possible,” College Heights Foundation President Donald Smith said. “It will keep his legacy alive.”
 Smith said that if donors want to support the endowed scholarship in the long term, they can do so through the College Heights Foundation by specifying their donation for the Bill Haynes Scholarship Fund.
 “It’s not just a few students,” Smith said of the endowed scholarship’s support. “It’s countless numbers of students that will be helped with the generosity. We’re very grateful.”

Cates, who retired from USD 253 last year after a long career in early childhood education, said she wore a combination of head scarves and brightly colored wigs when she lost her hair. Her preschool-aged children at Maynard Early Childhood Center, especially loved a bright lime green wig.
 “The kids absolutely loved it, you know, they just thought it was the greatest thing in the world,” she said with a laugh. “But I usually just wore scarves or turbans and I was just more comfortable with them.”
 Cates was glad to be able to do her treatments locally. While she did miss some work, she was still able to remain in the classroom.
 “I continued to work, but I was so fortunate because my school was so supportive,” she said. “I also was fortunate I had a lot of sick days, so I always took off the day and chemo and I took the day off. … My principal was very understanding and just always just making sure everything is okay, and the paras in my room were like superstars. They were just excellent.”
 Cates said her last chemo treatment coincided with the last day of school in 2019.
 “I have to admit, I was okay that I didn't have to go back to school after that, because I was tired,” she said. After that, Cates underwent 35 rounds of radiation.
 Now, she’s still doing well. Cates had a clean mammogram in Nov. 2019 and was getting ready for her next checkup in just a few weeks. She credits the support of her husband, Steven, and their children for keeping her going during the tough times.
 Cates recommends those early in their journey to have faith and to remember that, in the long run, cancer is just “a bump in the road.”
 “It’s just another part of life that you just grow from it and it made me a stronger person,” she said.

David Bell likes to kill ‘em softly.
 Brash. Demonstrative. Egotistical. Selfish. The Purdue sophomore is none of those things that often describe the personality of a big-time receiver.
 Rather, Bell is soft-spoken. He’s humble. He’s reticent. He speaks in hushed tones. You have to listen intently when speaking to Purdue's star receiver. Pay attention to what he says … then watch him speak loudly on the field.
 Bell season-opening salvo on Saturday was heard loud and clear. In the Boilermakers’ 24-20 victory vs. Iowa, Bell was targeted a whopping 21 times and shredded the Hawkeyes for 13 catches for 121 yards and three touchdowns, the last of which came was the game-winner with 2:15 left from 6 yards out.
 "The guy makes plays," Purdue coach Jeff Brohm said this week. "He catches the ball in traffic and it’s just something that comes very natural to him. He has a knack for always catching the ball.
 "He was targeted quite a bit and he came through and did a very good job once again. "He’s one of those guys that doesn’t talk a whole lot. He doesn’t brag and bring that to his game. He’s all about business. He’s a great teammate."
 Bell's effort last Saturday in Ross-Ade Stadium earned him co-Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week honors.
 "I always have been a type of person just to let the game come to me," said Bell after practice on Tuesday. "I think when you try to force stuff, it tends not to go your way. So I just go with the flow, and then if Aidan (O'Connell) decides to target me however many times he targets me, I would just step up. ... "
 Dating back to last season, it was Bell’s fourth consecutive game with more than 100 yards receiving. He has seven such games in his career young career. In two career games vs. the Hawkeyes, the 6-2, 205-pound Bell has made 26 receptions for 318 yards and four touchdowns. Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz was impressed.
 "In my opinion, he's one of the best receivers we've faced in 21-plus years," said Ferentz after playing Purdue. "He gave us a hard time last year and the same thing again today. He's really tough to cover."
 O’Connell already knows all about the skill-set of Bell.  
 “He’s a special player,” O’Connell said after the win on Saturday. “He’s a quarterback’s dream. We’re really lucky to have him.”
 What would this offense be like if Bell played for an extended stretch with Rondale Moore, who missed the Iowa game for an “undisclosed” reason? The duo only played four games together last year before Moore was lost for the season with a hamstring injury. Bell also dealt with a shoulder injury early last year, too, the required offseason surgery. Could the tandem be on the field this Saturday at Illinois?
 “We're always hopeful and we'll see what happens during the week,” said Brohm. “ … Whenever he's ready to play, he will play.”
 With Moore out, fellow sophomore Milton Wright took a step up in the opener. And, it didn’t go unnoticed .

_Control_ is now available on Nintendo Switch in a cloud version that will require persistent high-speed internet access to play it.
 The surprise announcement came during today's Nintendo Direct Mini October Showcase.
 "This is the first time ever that a Remedy game is playable on a Nintendo console! We couldn't be happier that Nintendo Switch owners get to experience Control Ultimate Edition through the Cloud and join Jesse on her journey to becoming the Director of the Federal Bureau of Control. We hope players enjoy discovering secrets and putting Jesse's telekinetic powers to use in the weird, supernatural world we've created," said Remedy’s Communications Director, Thomas Puha.
 Control Ultimate Edition, which contains the main game and all the previously released expansions (The Foundation and AWE). The Foundation fills in more of the backstory of The Oldest House, while AWE ties Control and Alan Wake together. The game will feature an Enhanced Graphics mode at 30fps with ray tracing on, or an Enhanced Performance mode at 60fps with ray tracing off, all while streaming directly from Nintendo's cloud. An Unlimited Access Pass for Control Ultimate Edition will cost $39.99/£34.99.
 The details on how to get Control on your Switch are a bit confusing, so let's clarify it for you. First, you'll need internet access and a Nintendo Account to play Control Ultimate Edition (Nintendo isn't offering just the base game). Then, head to the _Nintendo eShop_, where you'll get a free trial download to test the game - since it's completely cloud-based, you'll want to know if your internet is up to snuff. According to the fine print, the game test will need to run for at least five minutes before you can purchase the Access Pass for Control Ultimate Edition - but it's not clear how long you'll have access to the trial.
 It's worth noting that there appears to be a queue to access the game. An attempt to download the playtest is met with an announcement that servers are at capacity.
 If you've been considering giving Control a go, now is your chance. The game is excellent, and while the cloud version may be a new concept for many Switch players, it's a smart move considering Control threatens to overheat my Xbox One every time I boot it up.

“Our focus is to teach full circle when it comes to growing and eating foods while incorporating STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics) into the curriculum,” Dorsey Attendance Center (DAC) teacher, Noell Vanasselberg said.
 When she says full circle, she means planting, harvesting, cooking, eating, and composting produce. Every step of the farm-to-table road is covered as a part of DAC’s new culinary greenhouse experience made possible by a $50k grant.
 “I applied to the Blue Cross Blue Shield Foundation for a grant to build a greenhouse and create a culinary teaching kitchen for elementary students,” she said. “We received over $50K and built a 40x50 greenhouse, an outdoor classroom, raised garden beds, and purchased a teaching kitchen.”
 The fifth and sixth grade students literally can get their hands dirty learning the finer points of planting, maintaining, and watching their produce grow until it’s time to harvest. The greenhouse consists of a variety of vegetables, but are not limited to yellow squash, zucchini, cucumbers, lima beans, blueberries, cabbage, collards, herbs, and peppers.
 “I have seen that students, like most of us, learn better by doing,” she said. “The culinary greenhouse experience is second to none in the fact that students are using their hands to complete projects that pertain to real life and real experiences.”
 In the classroom, Vanasselberg and Sherrod Wilson use the STEAM curriculum to teach students seed and plant maintenance, harvesting vegetables, making nutrition a priority, practical uses for tools and equipment in cooking, and composting leftovers.
 “We use seasonal vegetables to make into recipes all the while showing the nutritional value of each one and how it helps our bodies” she said. “The full circle for us is definitely a farm-to-table experience, except in a classroom environment – grow, cook, eat, compost.”
 The school’s culinary kitchen includes two portable Edible Education kitchen carts complete with small wares, water, and electricity components to run the oven, stove, and hot water heater, everything the teachers need to give the students the full kitchen experience and then some.
 “I believe we are the only school in the state that has the kitchen carts,” Principal Carson Cook said. “We had a film crew from Mississippi State University shooting a documentary about culinary greenhouse program. We’re very proud of all that’s been accomplished.”
 Cook said they were able to stretch their dollars for the program because of a small army of kind-hearted and hardworking volunteers.
 “Mr. Billy Trotter spent countless hours working on the building and organizing other volunteers,” Cook said. “He did a great job and saved us several thousand dollars.”
 Trotter handles the school’s maintenance and spent most of the summer getting the project off the ground so the student could get seeds in the ground.
 “We had a lot of help, if people showed up, I’d put them to work,” Trotter laughed. “We also owe a debt of gratitude to Walton’s Greenhouse for helping us get the greenhouse assembled.”
 Trotter said seeing the young students enjoying the program is enough for him.
 “We’ve done all this so hopefully they learn the importance of skills like gardening,” he said. “That makes it all worthwhile.”

 “Then, we raised another couple hundred dollars,” Hawley said excitedly. “We took another shopping trip to Walmart. They were able to buy even more things.”
 Then, spring break happened with a looming pandemic. Although the students did not return to campus, they were able to pivot and continue serving. In April, they donated to KCSL and donated to SOS in May.
 “When it hit in the spring, one of the things we looked at was helping people who might not receive a lot of communication,” Hawley said. “Those were the people we chose to serve at that time.”
 Students sent letters to nursing homes and people who had to quarantine to keep them informed of what was going on.
 The Interact Club had their first virtual meeting after school on Oct. 13 to discuss what projects they will do this year.
 “A lot of people do not like turning on their cameras and everything, there are a lot of people who are lonely,” Acevedo said. “So, we are trying to figure out a way to help make friends in middle school.”
 Hawley shared that the big school project this year is trying to help students who are experiencing loneliness and isolation make friends and connections with other people in school. He said the Interacters would send positive notes, letters and emails to other students at EMS to help students reconnect and bring some positivity during COVID-19.
 One of Hawley’s favorite things about being the facilitator is that he does not have to do much — the students decide what to do — and he is just there to set up the framework for discussion and guide them.
 “You just help others out and you are not really doing it for you, you are doing it for others,” Acevedo agreed. “You are helping others and you should not really expect to get anything in return.”
 Hawley said any EMS students interested in the club can contact him at andrew.hawley@usd253.net for more information.

There's an element of self-destruction inherent in adolescence. Yet, most high school dramas overplay the spirals of poor decision-making and meet them with either shallow or melodramatic consequences (I had to stop watching _Riverdale_ in the episode Archie chooses to go to jail … like, what?). Instead, _Grand Army_ finds its footing on a middle path, on which the lives of its characters are impacted by personal and external decisions.
 Jay, for example, finds his careless act on "Bomb Day" leading to the prolonged suspension of his best friend due to the exaggerated consequences of zero-tolerence policies and systemic racism. His own carefree nature is curbed by the reality of how the system treats Black boys, shifting his priorities in light of a world that doesn't try to understand him.

I believe either Loeffler or Collins retain the advantage in this race if either get into a runoff against Warnock. Georgia is still an overall Republican state despite strongly Democratic pockets in the metro areas. The question will be whether Collins or Loeffler will be able to keep the party together if either wins.
 Other areas are seeing the same divisions within the GOP. Look at the 14th Congressional District in northwest Georgia where Alpharetta transplant Marjorie Greene moved and defeated a local physician, John Cowan, for the Republican nomination. She is the de facto winner of the seat after her Democratic opponent dropped out of the race.
 The race split Republicans in northwest Georgia at a time when voters in the district — which runs from suburban Chattanooga in the north to suburban Atlanta in the south — need to keep the party together amid changing demographics that favor Democrats.
 The GOP has held power in Georgia for roughly 18 years after centuries of Democrat rule. In the final years of Democrat power, the party held on through a loose coalition of rural whites and urban Blacks. It fell apart with incumbent Roy Barnes’ loss in the 2002 governor’s race to a then-unknown state senator named Sonny Perdue.
 This Senate race and subsequent runoff will be a test of Republicans’ penchant for uniting and being motivated by their hatred for whatever Democrat is in power.

When the teams were finally given the okay to begin practice and an abbreviated schedule was announced, Sonke was excited and looking forward to the season opener with Superior.
 Four minutes into that game, Snoke took a hit that resulted in him being carried off the field on a stretcher with what many believed was a season ending arm injury.
 Hours later good news came. Sonke’s arm was not broken and he was cleared to return to play the following week against St. David.
 “When I got hit (against Superior) I was really hurting,” he said. “I was sad because I thought my last year here was over. When I found out my arm wasn’t broken I became angry because I shouldn’t have been carted off the field.”
 Valley Union coach Brandon Gilbreth said when he saw his running back lying on the field in pain his focus first was for Sonke but in the back of his mind he was also wondering how he was going to fill the huge void that was being created by Sonke’s loss.
 Not only did he play offense, defense and special teams that game, the senior started for the Blue Devils against St. David.
 On Saturday, Oct. 17 Jacob was in Chandler with his team preparing for a game with Mohave Accelerated. Going into the game Sonke said he really didn’t have any idea of what was about to happen.
 “My focus going into that game was doing all that I could to help us win the game,” he said.
 The Valley Union running back etched his name into the record books that afternoon, carrying the ball 34 times for 532 yards. He scored all seven touchdowns for his team in a wild 48-44 win, the first of the season for the Blue Devils.
 His performance broke the 1A single game rushing record set by another Valley Union Blue Devil, Ozzie Anaya in 1985, who ran for 477-yards in a win over Bowie. Sonke’s 532-yards is also currently the second highest single game performance 1A-6A; the highest being 566 yards set by Ethan Johnson of Mesa Westwood in 2015.
 “I couldn’t have broken the record if it wasn’t for my linemen blocking for me,” Sonke said. “They really helped me out.”
 He said at no point during the game was he ever keeping track of his stats and it wasn’t until afterwards he was made aware of what he had accomplished.
 “When my coaches told me how many yards I had and that I had scored seven touchdowns I was surprised,” he said. “At first I didn’t think anything of it. I was just happy to get the win. It was actually my dad who told me that I had set a state record.”
 Sonke, 17, the son of Lorena and Gary Sonke, has a twin sister Lizet. They are the youngest of seven children.
 Both are three sport athletes at Valley Union and amongst the top students in their class.They have already been awarded full tuition scholarships to Northern Arizona University.
 “I’ve been thinking about becoming a nurse,” the senior said. “My mother is a pediatric nurse at TMC. I really admire the work that she does.”
 The three-sport athlete for Valley Union says football is his favorite and he would welcome the chance to have the opportunity to play football at the next level.
 “If given the chance it’s something I would definitely consider,” he said.
 Sonke didn’t even begin playing football until his freshman year.
 “My mom encouraged me to go out,” he said. “She thought it was something I would enjoy. I did, so I kept playing.”
 Of all the aspects to the game Jacob Sonke says he really enjoys hitting people and would prefer playing linebacker more than anything else.
 “I don’t mind playing both offense and defense but if I had to choose one over the other I’d choose defense,” he said.
 Throughout his high school career Sonke has played under three different head coaches at Valley Union. Despite the changes and being a part of a small school, Jacob Sonke likes being a Blue Devil.
 “It’s pretty special when your best kid is your hardest worker,” Valley Union football coach Brandon Gilbreth said. “I’ve helped coach Jacob for several years. I believe every other player on this team looks up to Jacob.”
 Assistant coach Dusty Vasquez added Jacob is the type of player who leads by example.
 “I think that’s why the other kids on the team look up to him the way they do,” he said.
 Jacob Sonke credits his parents for his work ethic.
 “They have taught me to give it my all no matter what even if I’m not the best,” he said. “My older brother Luis has taught me a lot about playing running back and how to hit.”
 Gilbreth added Jacob’s success on and off the field is a testament to the kind of student athlete Jacob Sonke is.
 “He’s the type of kid that every coach would dream of having on the team,” Gilbreth said.

A: This was a simple decision to a tough question. Currently there are 24 board members. The Board of 2022 will have 18 members, possibly less doing more in their roles as board members. The question of the 10% cut doesn't take effect until that 2022 board is sworn in. Additionally the board salary has remained unchanged since 2011 I believe. The 2020 board will be better informed to make that decision. A cut to a future board with unknown size or roles made no sense. Tough cuts certainly lie ahead.

 It seems very clear to us that lines are being drawn within the Keyser City Council and it is now more important that ever for our city officials to step up and fill the seat that has been vacant since William Zacot resigned in early September.   According to the city charter, when a council member resigns or can no longer serve for some reason, it is up to the mayor to appoint someone who must then be approved by a majority of the council.   Mayor Damon Tillman chose not to appoint anyone at the Sept. 23 meeting, however, and instead put out a plea for anyone willing to serve to send in a letter of interest by the Oct. 14 meeting.   There were two letters received and again the decision was delayed supposedly because one member of the council was absent that night due to medical reasons and another, Jennifer Junkins, had to recuse herself because one of the letter writers was her husband.   First of all, while we applaud their effort to determine any interest in serving the city, the city officials are not following the charter as it outlines the process of filling a vacant seat.   Again, it is up to the mayor to appoint someone, and the council to approve his appointee.   We admit this may not be an easy task with the current mayor and council, as they have not exactly been on the same page with some of the issues here lately, including the recent discussion of the police department and dispatch.   We want to add, however, that we wouldn't want the council to be, as the mayor said the other day, \"a bunch of bobble heads sitting up there.\" Differing opinions and honest discussion can be beneficial to city governments, as long as the differences don't become insurmountable or rife with personal agendas.   For that very reason, however, it is important to have every seat filled so the elected officials can more effectively consider varying options in order to do their job.   We would encourage mayor Damon Tillman to go ahead and make an appointment during Wednesday's meeting. Someone that he feels will serve selflessly, honestly, and with dedication to doing what is right for the people of Keyser.   There has to be a lot of people out there like that who may not have thought about sending in a letter, but who would step up if approached with the idea.

Now that we have equipped most students with the computers they need to connect to school, how can we use that capacity to improve learning? Perhaps we could have students continue learning at home to the extent that helps them, while reducing class sizes on campus. Maybe high-quality, packaged online courses will do the trick for some academic subjects, allowing teachers more time and freedom with courses that call for more interaction.
 These kinds of educational decisions are in the hands of people who have terrific expertise but who aren’t on the ground, living the experience the way students, teachers and parents do. We supposedly overhauled a fair amount of curriculum with the Common Core standards, but it hasn’t proved to be any kind of magic formula to newly engaged and excited learning.
 I’m looking for your ideas to help inform this editorial on truly rethinking public education in our state. Not all ideas will be used, but they all will be read and considered. Pass this on to friends and acquaintances who might have something to say. And please email me at karin.klein@latimes.com about this or any other school-related concerns you have. If you’re willing to be interviewed, please include a phone number. And if you don’t want your name published, please let me know that, too.

Another pertinent part of the film is the tragic times in which we are talking about it. Today, every single daily wage worker is unsure about where he or his family will get their next meal from. This is the overarching reality of a country obsessed with GDP growth figures; it is not able to wake up to the realities of those in times like these who have to work hard every day of their lives to make ends meet for their families.  _Matto ki Saikil _poignantly captures that progress and development are just hollow words, which have no meaning for India's poor. At various points in the film, in more than two decades of toiling and working hard  _Matto_ , like other migrant labourers in India, has achieved very little for himself and the people around him.

“So, the answer is that with our current measures – which are similar but with variations in different parts of Europe – there’s still evidence that there isn’t as much social distancing as there was when we clamped down on the first wave.
 "And so we know that the risk is significant [and] that cases will continue to grow.”
 He said that we are “still relatively early in the second wave” but added: “The number of cases is rising very significantly – it was 22,800 on October 27 and the seven-day average was just over 22,000. So there are an awful lot of cases.
 “One of the differences of course is that we are better at looking after people with coronavirus now.
 “And so hopefully the case fatality rate will be lower than it was in the first wave. But at the end of the day, the fatality rate, the number of people who die, is a product of the number of people who are infected and their vulnerability.”

On the other hand, Kemp and Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan are among the Republicans supporting Loeffler.
 Polls in Georgia races have proven to be not as generous to Republicans as the final outcome showed. Case in point: polls generally showed Republican David Perdue and Democrat Michelle Nunn neck and neck in support days before the 2014 election for U.S. Senate. Yet, Perdue prevailed with 53% of the vote.
 Polling in this year’s Senate race show Loeffler and Collins battling for second place and a spot in a runoff with Democrat Raphael Warnock, who is the leader at this point and someone Georgia Democrats have united behind. Warnock appeared to gain the lead under the radar as Loeffler and Collins waged their well-watched battle royale. The Democrat is from Savannah and leads Atlanta’s historic Ebenezer Baptist Church. He, like Loeffler before, has no political experience.

Following the news that Oscar Isaac might be playing Moon Knight in the new Disney Plus show, Deadline reports that Mohamed Diab is on board to direct the series.
 There’s no official confirmation of Diab – best known for the Egyptian political thriller Cairo 678 – joining the project from Marvel, but we do know that Jeremy Slater will serve as showrunner. Slater developed The Umbrella Academy for Netflix, so we definitely trust him with another comic book adaptation.
 For anyone who needs a quick intro to the superhero Moon Knight: he's kind of similar to Batman. Moon Knight has several different identities, and an array of gadgets, like boomerangs shaped like crescent moons. He also got superpowers from Khonshu, a character based on the Egyptian god of the moon – though it's sometimes unclear whether this is just a delusion or not.
 Marvel has a variety of TV shows in various stages of development at the moment – WandaVision is releasing this year, while The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is currently filming, and projects like Ms. Marvel and She-Hulk have cast their lead characters (though we’re not totally sure if Tatiana Maslany is officially She-Hulk, after she denied the casting). Other Disney Plus series on the way include Loki with Tom Hiddleston, Hawkeye with Jeremy Renner, and potentially a Nick Fury show with Samuel L. Jackson.
 Moon Knight looks like it’s shaping up to be a hit already, especially if Isaac really is playing the titular character – after his time as Poe Dameron in Star Wars, and what looks to be an epic role in Dune, we can’t wait to see Isaac take on another franchise.
 While we wait for more news on what’s next for the MCU, check out our guide to everything we know so far about Marvel Phase 4.

GREENWOOD, SC (FOX Carolina) - A family in Greenwood is turning a tragedy into a way to give back. Eva is almost 30 weeks pregnant, but her son's prognosis is that he will only live a few hours or days after birth.
 That is due to a rare genetic disorder called Trisomy 13 as well as a condition involving his brain and heart.
 This family has come to terms with the diagnosis that there is a slim chance that they will leave here with their baby. So now they are using their time when they are grieving to also give back.
 They have created these care packages with items that were donated by various companies to support their effort to honor little Riley.
 Eva Allegretti says, "unfortunately with Riley, it is difficult because is difficult because his heart gives him about 48 hours. That’s what the cardiologist told us. Not looking at his brain. His brain could not trigger it to tell him to start breathing so he could have a seizure so it’s really unknown if you will make it to that point which our goal, with the doctors, is to get to that point to meet him regardless of how much time we have."
 Time that they are now using to honor a legacy, earlier than a parent should.
 They are talking about the legacy of an unborn baby boy diagnosed with a rare genetic condition, coupled with an underdeveloped heart and brain. This has shifted his parents to finding joy in this tragedy.
 "It was kind of like a split in the road for me. Either I keep grieving or i find a way to bring joy in all of this while I still have the time with him," Eva says.
 "It’s great to leave that legacy of our son," Dr. Zach Allegretti says.
 Riley's life inspired them to put together diaper bags full of things that are made specifically for babies entering the NICU - totaling about $1,000 each, which will be a blessing for 12 families like they say the hospital has blessed them.
 They held a birthday party for Riley.
 Eva says, "It’s kind of a pseudo-birthday because one thing we are certain of is that he’s going to have a birthday. The Iowa Hawkeye football team actually put together a video saying happy birthday to him as well."
 Dr. Allegretti says this has reminded him of "how much of a caring woman she is. Seeing it from my perspective from the medical side knowing what these packages and what these things will mean for the family is something I’ll never forget."
 Zach is a Doctor at Self Regional as well and they say the support has been remarkable.      Eva says, "we are happy that he can be remembered by both strangers and by our family and friends. This is also a way to get back to this hospital system. Everyone that through his residency has been outstanding with support."      Zach says, "the attendings and everyone here at Self has been super supportive just being able to be there and help us during this time."
 This family says the support has been amazing so far and the hardest part of this is still to come.
 They want to raise awareness about the condition and donations for the NICU.
 More on their story.
 There is also a way that you can contributed financially to help with medical costs and possibly funeral costs for baby Riley.
