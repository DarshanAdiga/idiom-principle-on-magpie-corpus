“In the Glynn game, we were exposed with running to the strength with the tight end overset, and what I call a sniffer, upback, in the blocking game — putting more people to block there than we had to defend. We have to make that adjustment.”
 The Pirates recovered from the opening drive to hold the Mustangs to just over 125 yards the rest of the contest, and they’ll likely need to be prepared to play another physical ballgame against the Blue Devils.
 On the offensive side of the ball, the focus for Brunswick is maintaing balance between the run and the pass.
 South Effingham committed to having one more man in the box than Brunswick, which gave it a constant numbers advantage in the run game. Quarterback KJ Lee was actually the Pirates’ leading rusher with 59 yards while standout running backs Chuckobe Hill and Khamori Simmons combined for just 84 yards on 20 total carries.
 Running a 3-3 stack, Statesboro will also try to take away Brunswick ground attack.
 “If you allow them to make you one dimensional, they can cause problems,” Pender said. “Richmond Hill did a great job, and teams that have beat them have done a really good job, of staying two dimensional. I think that’s a key
 “For us, we have to be more of that balanced-type offense. If we come in with balance, and we play the type of ball that we know we’re capable of playing, we stand a good chance.”
 The Pirates have demonstrated the ability to make teams pay for loading up in the box in recent weeks. Coming off his miraculous 75-yard game-winning touchdown catch against Glynn Academy in the City Championship, Tyrease Jones recorded two catches for 120 yards and two scores last week — one of his receptions going the distance from 91 yards.
 Jones’ presence, along with fellow burner Amarion Whitfield gives opposing defenses something to consider in their attempts to slow Hill and Simmons.
 “It makes teams think about it when they play us without a safety; it makes teams think about it when they decide to play him one-on-one with no safety help over the top,” Pender said. “You’re going to have to account for that, and if you do account for that, then you take your man out of the box and we’re evened up in the run game.”
 If Pender is ultimately correct about Statesboro’s placement in the Region 2-6A hierarchy, a win today would set Brunswick up to host a first-round playoff game at Glynn County Stadium the last week of November.

 Guterres said that will be main U.N. objective in 2021 -- to create “a global coalition in which all countries, all companies, all cities in the world commit themselves to a transition to carbon neutrality, to have net zero emissions in 2050.”

The debate, moderated by NBC's Kristen Welker, was a final chance for each man to make his case to a television audience of tens of millions. And questions swirled beforehand as to how Trump, whose hectoring performance at the first debate was viewed by aides as a mistake that turned off viewers, would perform amid a stretch of the campaign in which he has taken angry aim at the news media and unleashed deeply personal attacks on Biden and his adult son.

Eight million cases of coronavirus have claimed more than 220,000 lives across the nation. No precise figures are available for the number of people succumbing to the virus who were weakened by one or more preexisting conditions.
 Forty-thousand Americans infected with coronavirus were in hospitals as of the time of the debate, Welker noted at the outset of the debate.
 Former Vice President Biden said another 200,000 will die because Trump is not doing enough to turn the tables on the coronavirus. “Anyone responsible for the number of deaths should not remain in office,” Biden said.
 Biden said he would support mandates, including closures, that were based on science and advised by health officials. He also would favor mandatory masks and rapid testing.
 “I will take care of this,” Biden said. “I will end this. I will have a plan.”
 That sparked the ire of Trump, who contended Biden would shut down the country and wreck the economy. “We can’t close up our nation,” Trump said. “You won’t have a nation.
 “All (Biden) talks about is shutdowns. If you go and see what’s happened to New York, it’s a ghost town.”
 Biden blamed Trump for the high mortality rate, claiming he ignored the science and has failed to provide the strong and prudent leadership expected from the nation’s chief executive. “The president still has no comprehensive plan,” Biden said.
 Trump said a vaccine will be available soon and quickly distributed across the country by the military.
 “It’s not my fault it came here,” Trump said. “It’s China’s fault.”
 Trump said the situation is improving, that many of the recent reported spikes are already going down.
 “More and more people are getting better,” Trump said, including his own recent successful recovery from the virus. “We’re rounding the turn, we’re rounding the corner. It’s going away.”
 When Trump said the nation was learning to live with the virus, Biden fired back.
 “Learning to live with it? Come on, we’re dying with it,” Biden said.

Tikkun Olam is Hebrew for “repair the world.” Devorah Channah Roth (Devo) viewed each day of her life as a blessing and throughout her life, she committed daily mitzvahs. She took her final breath and as Shakespeare said, “shuffled off this mortal coil” on Oct. 20, 2020.
 Devorah was born in Haifa, Israel, three score and 11 years ago, and was the daughter of Morris and Leah Fish, Holocaust survivors. In 1953, tired of the horrors of war and wanting a better life, Devorah and her parents migrated to a refugee camp in post-Nazi Germany. From 1953 to 1956, they lived with 2,000 other refugees seeking resettlement. Paperwork and family sponsorship led to their freedom from this waystation. Devorah learned the language of suffering and knew many languages before leaving for America. With hopes and dreams, her family sailed to New York City and took a train to Scranton, Pa. They came with nothing and made lasting impressions on everyone who crossed their paths. Devorah and her parents were most proud of getting their American citizenship.
 On June 10, 1967, Devorah met her husband, William B. Roth III, on a blind date. After the Kent State massacre, they hitchhiked from England to Yugoslavia, stayed in Greece for the summer, and hitchhiked back to England. In August 1970, they got engaged in Nonsuch Park in the outskirts of London. They married at sunrise in Syracuse on Jan. 19, 1971, and have shared a beautiful love story full of adventures for almost 50 years.
 Devorah attended Keystone College and SUNY Binghamton, where she studied Plato, Wittgenstein, and learned Sanskrit. She graduated from Syracuse University with a B.A. in selected studies on Jewish religious thought. Devorah received her master’s degree in art therapy from Marywood University.
 Devorah taught at various Temples in Syracuse, Wilkes-Barre and Scranton. Fittingly, in Scranton, the city where her family emigrated, Devorah worked with the Russian Immigrant Resettlement Program at Jewish Family Services. She then worked as a mobile therapist with foster children at Kids Peace. For the past 11 years, she has made Marworth her home away from home. She loved working with her Marworth Family as a chemical addictions specialist and viewed it as soul work. Her art therapy with patients opened doors of perception for many in the healing process and helped countless people overcome their battle with addiction.
 Living forward, Devorah is survived by her husband, William B. Roth III, and their three beautiful children, Maya, Yogi and Ravi; one favorite son-in-law, Michael Bisignano; one favorite daughter-in-law, Amy Kim; and four gorgeous grandchildren, Ethan William Bisignano, Wes Harrison Bisignano, Zayn Young Suwaity, and Maikaye David Roth. She is also survived by her brother, David Aaron Fish, Julie Fish, their daughter, Sarah, and various cousins and relatives scattered throughout the world.
 Devo was a force to be reckoned with and she found awe and wonder in the little things. She always spoke her truth, looked you straight in the eye, saw the holy in all, and lived and quite literally died on her own terms. She loved her family, theater, flowers, art, Law and Order/Blue Bloods, gorgeous sunsets, and was thrilled to fly around the world to a family wedding celebration in Bali, Indonesia (the “Island of the Gods”) in the summer of 2019, where she fell in love with the Canang Sari, a daily offering in praise and prayer. She also loved college football, specifically the people within the game, and earned the nickname Coach from many of the parents and players she grew to love.
 Devorah and her family want to thank all who supported and understood her directness and positivity in light of pervasive suffering. Her lifelong odyssey from the Shtetl to Suburbia was truly a magical journey. Devorah knew the fragility of life and practiced kindness and compassion while always being fierce with the truth. She has so many stories that will continue to be told.
 A direct cremation was held in the Poconos and Devorah’s cremains will be scattered to the invisible winds in every direction. Friends and family can visit as the family will be sitting Shiva at 115 South Turnpike Road in Dalton. Hours of mourning will be held Saturday, 7 to 9 p.m., Sunday, 11 a.m to 2 p.m., and Monday, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. People attending Shiva at this time are asked to wear a mask and follow social distancing protocols. Parking is available behind the Dalton Fire Hall.
 Devorah would ask that you do your part to help restore the world and to remember Tikkun Olam. In lieu of flowers, please make contributions to the charity of your choice that will help repair the world of its suffering.

Another area of proptech, which has seen intense interest, is mall-enabled eCommerce. How do shopping centres engage in this? And what is the value proposition for tenants and shoppers? Having some kind of eCommerce offering on behalf of a mall is the difference of being in business or not, under certain and recently experienced situations. As an example, Placewise is now engaged in a project for a substantial new development in Europe where the ambition is that all products in the mall across all tenants are searchable and for sale in the digital channels of the mall. The products are offered for pick-up at the mall or for home delivery.

The BC Liberals are the current official opposition party. After the Liberal party’s defeat in 2017, Christy Clark the previous premier of BC, announced her resignation. Andrew Wilkinson won the resulting leadership race with 53% of the vote and became the leader of the official opposition in 2018. It seems that the irony of winning a leadership race through ranked choice voting, while simultaneously being in staunch opposition of proportional representation, is lost on Wilkinson. But it is not the only time his views and actions have been out of touch. Wilkinson has claimed that 70% of post- secondary students complete their studies without any debt and that the campaign donation system is one that works, in light of a _New York Times_ article entitled “British Columbia: The 'Wild West' of Canadian Political Cash.” He has also faced backlash for stating that students should be paying interest on students loans, that renting is “fun,” showing full-throated support of continuing the cultural genocide against Indigenous peoples, and being complicit in sexism aimed at Bowinn Ma. The BC Liberals current platform consists of the typical neoliberal values of reducing regulation, while investing in private industries.

Lebanon (6-2-1), the No. 2 seed, hosted No. 3 seed Hanover (8-3-1) on Thursday with the visiting Marauders winning 2-1.
 “We haven’t seen them this season, but we know they are a good team, but we’re a good team, too,” said Daley. “We’re excited to still be playing.”
 The New Hampshire Interscholastic Athletic Association adopted an open tournament format with field hockey this fall due to the coronavirus, allowing schools to play a regional schedule and out of the division.
 Teams were placed into four regional clusters for the playoffs. There were five teams in the Region 3 cluster. Despite being one of only two undefeated teams in Division II (along with Souhegan, 9-0), Kennett along with Plymouth, Kingswood, Hanover and Lebanon were placed in Region 3. All five schools were placed into a hat and drawn at random for seedings and home teams. As luck would have it, Kennett drew the No. 5 seed, the lowest possible number.
 Kennett will now travel to Hanover for Region 3 cluster finals on Monday at 3 p.m., weather-permitting.
 The semifinals are schedule to be held on Wednesday with the winner of Region 2 playing the winner of Region 2 and Region 1 playing Region 4. A draw will take place to determine the home teams for the games.
 The finals are slated for Nov. 1, and again the home side will be determined by a blind draw.
