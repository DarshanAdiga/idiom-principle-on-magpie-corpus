Though she has only served three years on the federal bench, Judge Barrett certainly seems an exemplar of this model. At the White House on Saturday, Judge Barrett said her legal principles are those of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, for whom she clerked. This could be dismissed as a rote genuflection to the revered Scalia, but her opinions and scholarship suggest she means it.
 As David Rivkin and Andrew Grossman write nearby, her reasoning shows careful attention to statute and the Constitution. Her dissent in Kanter v. Barr (2019) on broad restrictions on gun rights for convicted criminals is especially impressive.
 The easy decision would have been to go along with the panel majority, and popular opinion, by barring gun ownership to felons. Judge Barrett looked at the constitutional history and the Supreme Court’s Heller precedent to make important distinctions that protect the Second Amendment the way liberal jurists once protected the First Amendment regarding unpopular political speech. Perhaps on the High Court she can coax Chief Justice John Roberts to stop treating the Second Amendment as the prodigal son of the Bill of Rights.
 Democrats will portray her as a blank check for executive power, but they misjudge her principles. She has ruled against the Trump Administration on immigration law, notably in Morales v. Barr, a deportation case.
 At a Hillsdale College event in 2019, she noted that “(Justice) Robert Jackson owed his career to Roosevelt. . . . Yet Jackson did not allow whatever personal loyalty or affection that he had for Roosevelt influence his decision in (Korematsu, the Japanese-American internment case in World War II). Unfortunately, he was in the minority. His was a dissent. The Court decided 6-3 that the exclusion order was constitutional.”

What’s for dinner has taken on a new meaning for some Arc Southern Maryland residents.
 A new program, called Made with Love, that the nonprofit implemented in July has resulted in volunteers making 20 dinners for residents of the nonprofit’s residential group homes in Calvert, Charles and St. Mary’s counties.
 Since COVID-19 hit in mid-March, the residents and their visitors have not had the opportunity to eat out at restaurants due to strict guidelines. So Arc Southern Maryland staff came up with the idea for volunteers to make dinners.
 So far, 20 meals have been provided to residents, said Lyndee Waldbauer, a spokeswoman for the Prince Frederick-based nonprofit.
 Many of the volunteers signed up to make one meal, but after their experience, they signed up for more, a press release states.
 One of the volunteers, Shirley Bean, has been making meals for two homes every month.
 “I am happy to help,” Bean said in the release. “I love cooking and hosting; this gives me the chance. My aunt lives at Sandy Point [a group home in Prince Frederick] and this gives her a chance to have some family cooking. We have missed having events with her.”
 Volunteers of all ages have signed up and are finding joy in making meals.
 Madison Meade, a senior at North Point High School in Waldorf, reached out to do a meal as a community service project and had so much fun doing it, she signed up to make more.
 “I got involved because I realize that giving back to your community — especially in such an uncertain time — is important,” Meade said in an email. “I have made two so far, but I would love to make more.” Her first dinner was lasagna, salad, rolls and strawberry shortcake, and the second was a chicken and rice casserole, applesauce and cookies.
 Making dinners is something families can do together or someone can do solo.
 With 30 residential homes in Southern Maryland, dinners can be provided any day of the week throughout the tri-county area, so the flexibility is appealing to volunteers.
 “The heart to want to volunteer is what is needed, and we can make it work from there,” Waldbauer said in the release.
 She noted that with residential staff now working around the clock, including preparing all meals at their homes, the program is an opportunity to give staff a respite from cooking while bringing in something different and made with love for everyone to enjoy together.
 “This pandemic has been tough, but our volunteers continue to shine and show the positive outcome of community,” Waldbauer said.
 If interested in making a meal to deliver to one of the nonprofit's homes in Southern Maryland, email lwaldbauer@arcsomd.org.

It will take several years before the Bryson DeChambeau Effect is fully realized, but on Wednesday, he gave an indication of where he's going after a 2020 U.S. Open win at Winged Foot Golf Club. That path includes a 48-inch driver (currently sitting at 45.5 inches) and some inspiration from "Happy Gilmore" ahead of the 2020 Masters.
 DeChambeau returns this week at the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open, where he is a past champion. He said he's going to try and drive four of the par-4 greens and was hitting 360-yard drives into the driving range net early in the week. And while what he does at TPC Summerlin is of some interest, what he does in five weeks at Augusta National Golf Club could be industry- shifting.
 "I'm looking forward to trying to put in a 48-inch driver and see what that can do for the golf course and what opportunities it will present for me," said DeChambeau of the Masters in November. "It's going well. I think there is a lot of ... I guess you could say advantages to having a 48-inch driver and being able to put it in play and keep it in play. So working on that. Still need to get some things worked out, but so far it's been pretty amazing."
 Thus far, DeChambeau has leveraged several things -- including, but not limited to, his body, his golf ball, his swing, his fitness and his eating -- to become the longest player on the planet. Scarily (?), the actual apparatus he uses to bash the golf ball has to date not been one of those things. Now, it apparently will be.

Fresh off the program’s first-ever Class 6A win, it would be easy to understand if Braswell relaxed a bit as its non-district slate winds down.
 That, however, is not the case for the Bengals.
 After knocking off Keller in overtime last week, Braswell now shifts its focus to a Richardson Pearce team that enters the matchup at 0-2.
 But as was the case after the Bengals' season-opening loss, head coach Cody Moore believes in just trying to get a little bit better than the previous week.
 “There’s a lot we’ve got to get cleaned up on both sides of the ball,” Moore said. “We’ve got to be better in the redzone. I thought it was poor execution on our part.”
 That lack of execution forced Braswell to settle for four field goal attempts within the Keller redzone — making three and having one blocked — which resulted in needing the extra frame.
 It’s a bit of a double-edged sword because if Braswell finished off any one of those drives with a touchdown, maybe the game wouldn't have gone into overtime.
 On the flip side, having clutch kickers to make game-tying attempts to force overtime is a blessing.
 “I don’t talk to them,” Moore said with a chuckle when discussing what he says to his place kickers before going on the field. “I just leave them alone.”
 While Moore was pleased to get the win against a good defensive team in Keller, he knows there are still some things the team must continue to work on and adjustments that must be made.
 “We’re looking at making some adjustments personnel-wise,” he said. “That’s what's good about the non-district part of [the schedule] is trying to fit the pieces into the right place.”
 The hope there is his defensive unit can start to create some takeaways as it hasn’t been able to turnover its opponents in either contest. Moore said he’d also like to see his defensive unit tackle better, which has resulted in opponents picking up large chunks of yards.
 As for Pearce, it enters only averaging 15.5 points and just under 300 yards of offense a game. On defense, Pearce is giving up an average of 332.5 rushing yards per game, which could lead to a big game for running backs De’Auvion Gafford and Jamerion Sanford, as well as quarterback Tristan McClary running out of the backfield.
 And, as Moore is fond of saying, Braswell will execute on what the game dictates.

Charles County commissioners heard an update about new and closed businesses at the St. Charles Towne Center in Waldorf during their Oct. 6 meeting.
 Carlos Saniel, the mall's general manager, addressed the commissioners about the mall, which is located between Smallwood and St. Patrick's drives and Crain Highway. Saniel said that tenant and shopper occupancy at the mall is above average for Simon Properties' 200-plus properties.
 With that in mind, he noted that Sears closed April 11. In addition, the Old Navy and Justice stores recently closed.
 However, Unique Beauty Supply and Art O'Dell recently opened, Saniel said, noting that both are locally- and minority-owned businesses. Hypnotic Ink, a tattoo parlor, is now open in the Sears wing of the mall.
 Coming soon are LuvPlates BBQ, Bern's Creperie, Teriyaki Way and Fast Jewelers Jewelry and Watch Repair.
 He noted that AMC Theater is now open, too.
 Saniel said the mall ownership's No. 1 priority is to find a replacement at the former Ruby Tuesday location. "We had a deal signed pre-pandemic but investors backed out," he said.
 On the positive side, the food court is at pre-COVID-19 levels. "Every week we're adding seating to the food court," Saniel said. The mall is allowed to have 75% of its seating available, under statewide order from Gov. Larry Hogan (R). "It was standing room only last weekend," Saniel said, noting some people with food had to wait for seating to open up so they could sit down.
 Saniel and Dexter Bordes, president of the Westlake Business Assoc., both said that the area needs more sidewalks. Some existing sidewalks end abruptly or lead into the woods, for example. In other cases, foot traffic has resulted in dirt paths and some areas are impassable. Bordes said that crossing U.S. 301 in the area is dangerous. The Tri-County Council recently requested funds for a crossing in the area as part of its annual transportation funding request letter that it submitted to the Maryland Department of Transportation.
 In addition, Bordes said that the grass in some areas is only cut by the county four times a year, but needs to be done more frequently.
 Commissioner Amanda Stewart (D) asked how often the county cuts the grass. County Administrator Mark Belton said he would look into it.
 Stewart said that, although it's nice to know which businesses are closing and opening, there is "a lot of concern about the quality of the shops" in the mall. "We're not being provided the quality that residents expect. I know a lot of people who will not go to the mall because there's not shops there (that) they frequent."
 Stewart asked Saniel about the company's plans to reinvent itself for the digital age.
 Saniel said that Simon Properties is on the cutting edge of property management. "We are not a traditional mall," he said, noting that "COVID has thinned the herd" of businesses that were suffering and ended up closing.
 "We've reached a partnership with Amazon," he said, noting the company is looking at turning over Sears and J.C. Penney stores into Amazon fulfillment and supply centers.
 "Simon continues to be aggressive with our acquisition strategy," he said.
 "I would hope that some of the innovative things you're doing across the nation could come to Charles County," Stewart said.
 Saniel said Lake O'Donnell near the mall "has become an eyesore, cesspool and potentially an environmental issue." He said Simon Properties conducted research to find out if it owned the lake so that it could beautify it, but the company doesn't own it.
 Commissioner Gilbert O. Bowling (D) asked about the county purchasing two lots near Lake O'Donnell for $780,000 and wondered how long the lots have been on the market. He wondered if purchasing those lots would provide ownership of the lake. Staff did not provide the answers, however.
 Saniel said the company is looking for help from the county with the aforementioned sidewalk issue and noted that, although the mall has an excellent relationship with the sheriff's office, he's looking for it to ramp up service at the site in the fourth quarter as things get back to normal.
 "I hear that their ranks are depleted, and they're actively hiring," he said of the sheriff's office. "I'm not sure they can cover all of the needs of the community."
 Last year, Simon Properties completed several projects, including conversion of the parking lot lights to LED, renovation of the restrooms, replacement of the food court seating and four skylights, and conversion of live plants to faux plants.
 Saniel said the mall will be closed on Thanksgiving Day for the first time this year, but noted that it will reopen on Black Friday.
 Commissioners President Reuben Collins (D) said the county will have another meeting in the future to consider more information about the mall.

The political left is also portraying Judge Barrett as a “radical” who will easily dismiss precedent, especially on abortion. This is what they say about every conservative, and they are wrong. She adhered faithfully to precedent on the Seventh Circuit, notably on abortion in Price v. Chicago (2019). One dissent she joined in an Indiana abortion case was vindicated at the Supreme Court. Our guess is that on overturning precedent she will fall in the Court’s middle—more willing than the Chief Justice but less than Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch.
 A note about abortion is in order here that will displease the left and right. Both sides claim for political reasons that they anticipate a repeal of Roe. v. Wade, but they are likely to be disappointed. Anti-abortion conservatives once supported Anthony Kennedy for the High Court because like Judge Barrett he is Catholic, only to be disappointed in Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992).
 Roe was transcended by Casey, which further embedded abortion rights in precedent. You can believe, as even Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said, that Roe was based on faulty logic and still believe the right to abortion is too settled in law to overturn now. The real legal battleground will be over the limits of state regulation such as late-term abortion and health restrictions.
 It’s no accident that Clarence Thomas is the only current Justice who has called for overturning Roe. Demanding that a nominee declare herself on Roe is a destructive exercise, whether from Democrat Mazie Hirono or Republican Josh Hawley, and Judge Barrett shouldn’t answer.
 Every new Justice changes the dynamics on the High Court, and in ways that are hard to predict. One helpful change with a sixth center-right Justice is that Chief Justice Roberts would need to persuade at least one other conservative if he wants to form a majority with the three remaining progressives.
 Democrats view all this with horror, but we think they would be wiser to view it as an opportunity. One reason Court nominations have become so bitter is because progressives have long viewed the judiciary as a second legislature for policies they can’t pass in Congress. Think racial preferences and climate regulation (Massachusetts v. EPA, 2007). If that avenue is foreclosed, as we hope it will be, then the left may have to achieve what they want the old- fashioned way—democratic persuasion and consent.
 This is also a lesson for Republicans, who shouldn’t default to the courts simply because there are more conservatives on the bench. In the best case, a more modest Supreme Court that sticks to the law and its constitutional calling may even cause Congress to return to doing its job of forging durable consensus.
 All of this is hope for the judicial future. For now, and no matter the election consequences, Republican Senators should do their elected duty and confirm an excellent nominee. Win or lose in November, they will have left a significant legacy in restoring proper constitutional government.

SALT LAKE CITY - Vice presidential debates typically play second-fiddle to the presidential contests, but President Donald Trump's COVID-19 illness - coupled with his and Democratic nominee Joe Biden's age - will thrust the spotlight on Mike Pence and Kamala Harris.
   
 The 90-minute event Wednesday will allow viewers to assess the understudies for the role of commander-in-chief. And there may be a clearer discussion of the policy differences between the two campaigns than was apparent during the first presidential debate, which quickly descended into chaos with name calling, frequent interruptions and the candidates veering away from subjects asked.
   
 Here's what to watch for in the Pence-Harris match up.
   
 Appearing presidential
   
 Both candidates will do their best to sell themselves as a credible potential replacement for the top of the ticket. That basic threshold for the vice presidential nominee is of heightened importance because Trump's illness - and the pandemic in general -increases the possibility that Trump, 74, or Biden, 77, might not be able to finish a term. Either would be the oldest president sworn into office on inauguration day next year, raising the risk even if COVID-19 goes away.
   
 "I suspect the renewed focus on succession will make the candidates focus even more on demonstrating that they are plausible presidents in the eyes of potentially reachable voters," said vice presidential scholar Joel Goldstein, an emeritus professor of St. Louis University.
   
 In addition, Pence and Harris will have a leg up on other potential presidential candidates in the 2024 election. So both need to do their best to help their running mate win in November while preserving their own chances of competing in four years.
   
 "I'll be curious to see to what extent, if any, (Pence) seems to be laying the groundwork for that possibility," said Republican strategist Michael Steel.
   
 Dominance of COVID-19
   
 Even before the president contracted COVID-19, the coronavirus pandemic was dominating the campaign. Harris will undoubtedly focus on the administration's response to the pandemic - and can specifically criticize Pence as head of the White House's task force.
   
 "He's not really in a position to defend Trump's handling on it because he and his office are a part of the failure," said Goldstein, the vice presidential scholar.
   
 Harris can also question if Pence acted appropriately after the president's diagnosis or whether he should have quarantined to potentially protect others from getting infected if he turned out to be a carrier, as well as to protect the line of succession if Trump's condition worsens.
   
 "When the president told me he was headed back to the White House, he told me to head to Utah," Pence said Monday after Trump tweeted that he would be leaving Walter Reed Hospital.
   
 Pence has gone after Harris for saying she wouldn't trust Trump's assurance on the safety of a COVID-19 vaccine.
   
 "That's an insult to thousands of dedicated scientists and researchers who have been working around the clock to save American lives," Pence said while campaigning in Pennsylvania last month.
   
 Pence going after the 'radical left'
   
 As much as Harris may want to talk about the pandemic, Pence has sought to paint her as part of the "radical left." He's accused Harris of wanting to abolish fossil fuels, banish red meat from Americans' diet and allow "abortion on demand right up to the moment of birth." In keeping with the Trump campaign's heavy emphasis on law and order, Pence has also criticized Harris for saying it's "outdated" and "wrongheaded" to "think the only way you're going to get communities to be safe is to put more police officers on the street."
   
 "What we have to do and what we will do is reimagine public safety," Harris said, before talking about improving communities.
   
 Alan Schroeder, a presidential debate historian and author of the book "Presidential Debates: Risky Business on the Campaign Trail," said Pence will try to portray Harris as an out-of-touch liberal from San Francisco.
   
 "I expect we're going to hear the words `San Francisco' a lot," Schroeder said. ""They're going to try to depict her as sort of a modern day, Angela Davis, or Emma Goldman, or pick your favorite female radical in American history."
   
 Pence is a 'master of the pivot'
   
 Harris used her prosecutorial background to bear down on Attorney General Jeff Sessions during a 2017 hearing on Russian interference in the 2016 election.
   
 "I'm not able to be rushed this fast," Session said at one point. "It makes me nervous."
   
 Schroeder said he doubts that Pence is "going to be quite the shrinking violet that Jeff Sessions was."
   
 "He will have studied, I'm sure, those exchanges and they're going to try to prepare him for that," he said.
   
 For her part, Harris has likely worked on strategies to get the famously disciplined Pence off his talking points.
   
 "He is a master of the pivot," said Robert Barnett, the Washington lawyer who has prepared many Democrats for presidential and vice presidential debates, including portraying Pence in Kaine's 2016 debate prep.
   
 Supreme Court opening
   
 Before Harris questions Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett from her seat on the Judiciary Committee at next week's confirmation hearing, the topic will likely come up during the debate. Democrats have tried to center their opposition to Barrett around her criticism of the court's decision upholding Obamacare, a ruling that will be revisited shortly after the election.
   
 But a Biden campaign aide said Harris won't shy away from arguing that the landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion is in jeopardy if Barrett is confirmed.
   
 "Judge Barrett has a long record of opposing abortion and reproductive rights," Harris said after Barrett's nomination to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg. "There is no other issue that so disrespects and dishonors the work of Justice Ginsburg's life than undoing the seminal decision in the court's history that made it clear a woman has the right to control her own body."
   
 Coming from a woman, Harris' charge could pack a bigger punch. And there's no bigger opponent of abortion than Pence, for whom it has been a top issue throughout his political career, setting up some potential fireworks.
   
 Pence's opposition to abortion is rooted in his deeply held religious beliefs as is Barrett's. Republicans have accused Democrats of anti-religious bigotry in questioning how Barrett's faith might affect her judicial opinions.
   
 Speaking to the Faith and Freedom Coalition last month, Pence accused Harris of having "attacked" a federal judicial nominee in 2018 for being a member of the Catholic Knights of Columbus fraternal organization. Harris had asked the nominee whether he was aware that the fraternal organization "opposed a woman's right to choose."
   
 "These attacks on our freedom of religion must stop," Pence said.
   
 Expanding the Supreme Court
   
 In the first presidential debate, Biden refused to say whether he supports adding justices to the Supreme Court if he wins. That's a move many liberals are calling for but could turn off the more moderate voters - particularly in the suburbs - who are contributing to Biden's polling advantage over Trump.
   
 Harris, herself, stumbled over the question in an MSNBC interview last week. After the Trump-Biden debate, she told CNN that the focus should be on the election now and Biden would "deal with later, later."
   
 She may get pressed again to get the ticket to take a position.
   
 'Religious freedom' issues
   
 Before Pence became vice president, he made national news through a controversial law he signed as Indiana's governor that critics said could be used to discriminate against gays and lesbians. The state law was modeled after the 1993 federal "Religious Freedom Restoration Act," which Harris wants to change. She's introduced "Do No Harm" legislation to amend the law, saying it's been used to discriminate against LGBTQ individuals, women and children in the guise of protecting freedom of religion.
   
 As vice president, Pence has continued to champion "religious freedom," making the subject ripe for contrast. He particularly likes to talk about the Little Sisters of the Poor, one of the religious non-profits which fought against Obamacare's requirement that birth control be included in health insurance offered by non-church employers.
   
 "President Donald Trump ended the assault on the Little Sisters of the Poor," Pence recently said, before accusing Biden of wanting to resume the fight.
   
 Harris is likely to counter that access to health care is a right and employers can't decide such issues for a worker.
   
 Pronouncing Kamala
   
 Trump likes to play around with Harris' first name, which is pronounced "comma-la," like the punctuation mark.
   
 "You know if you pronounce her name wrong, she goes crazy," Trump said at a September rally in Virginia, before mispronouncing it "kah-MAH-la" but adding, "It's like a comma. She's like a comma."
   
 Pence also uses the "kah-MAH-la" pronunciation. If he does it Wednesday, we'll see how Harris reacts.
   
 Audience size
   
 The 2016 vice presidential debate between Pence and Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine attracted 44% fewer viewers than the least-watched of the three presidential debates that year, according to the Pew Research Center. That was the biggest- ever drop-off.
   
 Even without the extra dynamic of Trump's hospitalization, the historic nature of Harris' nomination as the first woman of color on a major party ticket may attract a larger-than-usual audience. So far, the only vice presidential debate that was watched more than any of that year's presidential contests was the 2008 matchup of then-Sen. Biden and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. Nearly 70 million tuned in compared with 37 million in 2016.

"While less than 1% of American venture capital backed founders are Black, an even smaller percentage are women of color," Jenkins told The Associated Press. "We need to break down those barriers, and this is why I'm proud to have Ralonda at the helm of Broad Street Ventures and Sharrie coming on board as an investor. Black women are helping to rewrite the narrative and we are inviting more Black women to the table to create generational wealth for themselves and others. This is an important initiative to me, as my businesses are not only run by strong women but also supported by women."

While much of DoNotPay’s engine is rules-based, elements of the platform do use machine learning techniques such as natural language processing (NLP). For example, the company offers a Terms of Service (ToS) scanner that can spot undesirable clauses in small print — users upload a ToS document to DoNotPay, which then scans the text to highlight things such as forced arbitration clauses. Similarly, DoNotPay’s new email service also relies on ML to categorize emails by type.

"WEAR YOUR MASK. KEEP YOUR DISTANCE," Newton posted on Twitter Wednesday along with a photo of himself wearing a mask.
 Newton and the Titans make up the 11 confirmed positive tests among players, and the NFL said there were 15 new confirmed positives among personnel for last week in results announced Wednesday out of 37,002 tests given to 7,981 players and team personnel.
 "We have said all along that we expect positive cases," said Dr. Allen Sills, the NFL's chief medical officer. "As long as the virus is endemic in our communities, we will see new cases among our teams. Risk mitigation, not elimination, is the key."
 Both Sills and Dr. Thom Mayer, the NFL Players Association's medical director, said the key is everyone following the protocols.
 "The virus is still very much a threat not only to our season, but to the safety of everyone in our community," Mayer said in a statement.
 Buffalo coach Sean McDermott said no one's perfect when asked about the NFL's stricter protocols as his Bills (4-0) prepare for a game at Tennessee that may now be in jeopardy. McDermott said no one's perfect.
 "We're fighting an uphill battle," McDermott said. "I think we know that there's a challenge because of how easily this thing spreads."
 McDermott said the Bills have had no positives after beating the Raiders 30-23 in Las Vegas last week. The Raiders placed defensive tackle Maurice Hurst on the reserve/COVID-19 list Tuesday.
 The Titans had no positive tests Monday or Tuesday for the first time after six consecutive days of positive results. A third straight day was necessary for the team to be allowed back in its headquarters, stopping its planned return, according to a person familiar with the situation.
 Instead, the Titans' outbreak now is up to 22 cases with 20 returned since Sept. 29, according to the person who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because neither the NFL nor the Titans announced the latest results. The Titans already have had their game with Pittsburgh rescheduled from Week 4 to Oct. 25.
 The NFL gave New England and Kansas City an extra day after Newton tested positive Saturday, and the Chiefs beat the Patriots 26-10 on Monday night. But pushing the Bills' game with the Titans back by a day will be challenging because Buffalo is scheduled to host Kansas City on Thursday night, Oct. 15.

The four state legislators for St. Mary’s joined the county commissioners Tuesday night to discuss 13 law proposals for review before the General Assembly’s 2020 session, including the deletion of the St. Mary’s County Open Meetings Act.
 The county law, touted by officials as being the most rigorous in the state, had not been substantially changed since its adoption over 40 years ago despite attempts by previous commissioner boards. Last year, however, legislation passed allowing more topics to be discussed in closed sessions and adding the St. Mary’s County Metropolitan Commission, the housing authority and the public library board to the list of public agencies that must abide by the act, as well as legislation encouraging the use of new technology. A request to allow subcommittees to meet behind closed doors was shot down by the county’s delegates last year.
 If state legislators approve the request to remove the act, county government would then only have to abide by the state’s open meetings act, which is less restrictive when it comes to meeting transparency.
 David Weiskopf, county attorney, reminded the delegation St. Mary’s was the first county with an open meetings act and the rest of the state followed the next year.
 “For whatever reason we didn’t fold St. Mary’s into the rest of the state. … What happens with this separate one is we now have two that we have to look at,” he said. “There are minute differences, for example we could set an agenda behind closed doors and administrative functions would be easier.”
 Administrative function allows a board to receive a briefing behind closed doors on a variety of topics, some of which are required to be done in public under the local act. Under the state’s open meetings act, subcommittees are also allowed to conduct business in private.
 “As the sponsoring commissioner for this I agree with everything the county attorney said,” Commissioner Eric Colvin (R) said. “[Former] senator [Roy] Dyson did a great job writing it and then he voted to approve the state’s open meetings act, so he obviously approved of the one every other county in the state is using right now.”
 However, when commissioners were first publicly discussing their legislative proposals a few weeks ago, Dyson said in an interview the state’s law is weaker than the county’s, which he believes is why officials are pushing for the switch.
 While the law “ties officials’ hands a bit since they can’t have secret meetings,” Dyson said they have to be up front, which is good for the public, as well as the politicians when they leave office.
 “It’s harder to hide nefarious acts,” the former senator said.
 Del. Matt Morgan (R-St. Mary’s) said at the meeting he’s “conscious of the historical precedent” of the county’s act.
 “I think people in the community are very proud that sunshine laws actually originated in St. Mary’s County and we led the state on being transparent in state government,” he said.
 Commissioner John O’Connor (R) mentioned there has been some issues with subcommittees meeting during the COVID-19 pandemic because of the “logistics based on how we work the open meetings.”
 Morgan said he’s “apprehensive” about changing the law since if the state ever went in a different direction, “it’s safe to know St. Mary’s would still be operating under a pretty tight and transparent law.”
 He suggested tweaking the act to make some processes easier rather than getting rid of it altogether.
 “I know it does jumble up your meetings but I think we can make changes that directly effect some things … as far as Mr. Weiskopf’s job, that’s why he gets paid the big bucks,” the delegate stated, before saying he would take the legislation in front of the whole delegation for a formal vote.
 When it came time for public comment, several residents spoke against the removal of the county’s open meetings act.
 Jamie Raley of Avenue pointed out without the county’s open meetings act, items can be added to an agenda last minute, not giving enough time for citizens to react or prepare for it.
 “I can see both sides,” school board member Rita Weaver of Dameron said, adding that, “At this point you’re the county commissioners but we don’t know what thoughts or who will be in your seat in the future.”
 She mentioned although the other 23 jurisdictions in Maryland follow the state’s open meetings act, “St. Mary’s is not like the others; we are unique.”
 Weaver encouraged commissioners to “continue to engage citizens” and “remain transparent.”
 The delegation discussed with commissioners 12 other legislative proposals as well, including the decoupling of the St. Mary’s Metropolitan Commission debt from the county’s debt, reducing the amount of debt MetCom can incur, authority to enact a building excise tax, authority to increase the public accommodation tax from 5% to 7%, a $750,000 bond bill for the repair and reconstruction of the Brenton Bay pond and dam, allowance of body worn cameras on animal control officers, allowance of golf carts on Old Horse Landing Road, the establishment of an on-site consumption permit for some distilleries, moving responsibility of bingo licensing permits out of the sheriff’s office, to remove the termination date of the real property transfer tax, authority to issue up to $34.7 million in public facility bonds, authority to enact a building excise tax to replace a developmental impact fee and updating language within the county human relations commission.
 During public comment, Deb Rey, a former Republican delegate, said she disagreed with seven of the 13 proposals, but spoke in favor of body worn cameras for animal control officers and the transfer of bingo licensing permits.
 Bert Gagnon of Old Horse Landing Road called in to support legislation allowing golf carts on that county road, along with Karen Buckler, who claimed she regularly drives her golf cart on the road anyway.
 Sen. Jack Bailey (R-St. Mary’s, Calvert) said “as we get to Annapolis this year, things are going to be different than they have been in the past.”
 The state’s 90-day legislative session is set to start on Jan. 13. This year’s General Assembly ended abruptly due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 Bailey noted the number of bills senators will be able to introduce will be limited and although that does not apply to local bills, it will apply to “additional things we might have been looking at.”

It’s also unclear the extent to which CBP’s facial recognition might exhibit bias against certain demographic groups. In a CBP test conducted from May to June 2019, the agency found that 0.0092% of passengers leaving the U.S. were incorrectly identified, a fraction that could translate to a total in the millions. (CBP inspects an estimated over 2 million international travelers every day.) More damningly, photos of departing passengers were successfully captured only 80% of the time due to camera outages, incorrectly configured systems, and other confounders. The match failure rate in one airport was 25%.

"At the same point in time it's about putting, chipping, wedging," said DeChambeau. "You still got to do everything else really well."
 Still, as was the case at the U.S. Open, DeChambeau has eliminated longer irons on every hole except potentially on the par-3s. On the par-4s and par-5s, though? He rarely (if ever) hits them. This is the whole point, of course, and it has become his ethos, his brand.
 Nothing is off-limits, apparently. And that's the scary thing as an arms race heats up. DeChambeau will stop at nothing -- literally nothing -- to continue to be the longest, brashest golfer on the planet. He won't win every tournament this way, but he'll win a lot as long as his short game is decently sharp.

Cleveland manager Terry Francona recently revealed the extent of the health issues that sidelined him for most of the 2020 Major League Baseball regular season. Francona told reporters, including the Associated Press, on a Zoom call Wednesday that he underwent several surgeries in a four-day span and required an extended stay in the intensive care unit.
 "It was kind of a tough time," Francona said. "I don't want to go through that again. For a couple weeks there I was not just away from the game, I was away from everything. It was getting a little hairy there."
 When asked if the longtime skipper thought about retiring during his hospital stay, he said: "Some days when I was extremely frustrated, the thought crossed my mind. When it was hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel, but I tried not to think like that."
 Francona, 61, was forced to miss 48 of Cleveland's 62 games (60 regular season games plus two postseason games) during the abbreviated 2020 season due to the health issues. Cleveland was swept by the New York Yankees in the best-of- three AL Wild Card Round last week.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee will not be returning to the team's facility Wednesday after two more players tested positive amid the NFL's first COVID-19 outbreak, and the New England Patriots have canceled practice amid reports that a third player has tested positive for the coronavirus.
 Sports Illustrated reported that reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year Stephon Gilmore tested positive for the virus on Wednesday and was added to the team's reserve/COVID-19 list. The Patriots did not give a reason for Wednesday's cancellation and did not immediately respond when asked if it was related to a third positive test.
 Quarterback Cam Newton tested positive Saturday and is on the reserve/COVID-19 list, and the Patriots placed a defensive tackle from the practice squad on that list Tuesday. The Patriots are scheduled to host Denver on Sunday.

The Texas Department of Public Safety on Wednesday reported a 44-year-old Arp man died after a Friday wreck in Harrison County.
 Troopers on Friday responded to a two-vehicle crash on FM 31 about four miles south of Marshall, according to DPS spokeswoman Sgt. Jean Dark. A preliminary report showed the driver of a pickup, 75-year-old Lee Beard of Mount Enterprise, was headed west on FM 2625 when he stopped at a stop sign at FM 31 as a tractor-trailer, driven by Steven Craig Braswell, was headed south on FM 31.
 Dark said Beard failed to yield the right of way to the tractor-trailer and pulled into its path, causing it to jackknife into the southbound ditch. The rig struck a light pole and caught fire.
 Dark said Braswell was taken to a Shreveport medical center in critical condition where he died two days later.
 Beard suffered “non-incapacitating injuries.”
