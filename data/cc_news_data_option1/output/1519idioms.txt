  _The Phantom Menace_ is a film stuffed – perhaps overstuffed – with ideas, so many that it is hard to keep up with them. Though it is far from a perfect film, with stilted dialogue and sometimes uncomfortable acting, it is never a dull or boring movie. And as arcane as "the taxation of trade routes to outlying star systems" may seem, so are the origins of all wars – even the unbelievable one we're in now, which began not with a bat or pangolin, but with bureaucratic, political decisions that stretch back years.
 Mundane actions have massive consequences, and _The Phantom Menace_ still surprises by looking at some of those actions closely. Even the opening scene, with its discussion of blockades, negotiations, ambassadors and senators stands in opposition to the slam-bang openings of the first three _Star Wars_ movies.
 The first half of _The Phantom Menace_ can seem drawn out and dry, yet Lucas's script is doing much more than simply setting up the action that will lead to the discovery of Anakin Skywalker. It's also establishing a complicated world view, one in which politics as a whole is not to be trusted, but is the only imperfect option for getting anything done. Sound familiar?
 Bear in mind that within the first couple of minutes of the original _Star Wars_ , we've already learned about a civil war, an Imperial senate, and, a bit later, an "Old Republic." While he could have chosen a more action- oriented, mindless backstory, George Lucas uses _The Phantom Menace_ to begin showing how that republic became an empire, how a politician became a tyrant, and how the senate allowed it all to happen.
 In that regard, _The Phantom Menace_ is a more consequential and intriguing film than any of the most recent sequels. It's also pointedly, proudly a George Lucas film. Its sprawling story, which is always splitting its time between two or three different plot lines, bears much more resemblance to Lucas's earliest features – _THX-1138_ and _American Graffiti_ – than any of the _Star Wars_ films Lucas didn't direct. Watching _The Phantom Menace_ , it's easy to see Lucas's love of the craft of moviemaking come to the fore.

Maxi Lopez was the hero for Sinisa Mihajlovic's side, as he scored on the occasion of his second debut for the club to seal all three points at Stadio Comunale Luigi Ferraris.
 Sampdoria signed striker Lopez on loan until the end of the season with a view to a permanent transfer from Catania last week, and the Argentinian took just 24 minutes to break the deadlock in the _Derby della Lanterna_.
 The former Barcelona man, who scored four Serie A goals in 17 appearances for Sampdoria in 2012-13, played a neat one-two with Eder before firing low past Mattia Perin.
 And that goal proved to be enough for Mihajlovic's men, as they controlled the majority of the match in relative comfort.
 The win - which avenges Genoa's 3-0 win in the reverse fixture back in September - lifts Sampdoria to 13th in Serie A, while Gian Piero Gasperini's team remain 11th.

In fact, even the number of people dying is a moving target. COVID-19 deaths that happen at home appear to be widely underreported. And New York City increased its death count by more than 3,700 on Tuesday after officials said they were now including people who had never tested positive for the virus but were presumed to have died of it.
 But the missing data on deaths in the deaths-to-infections ratio is still almost certain to be dwarfed by the expected increase in the denominator when the total number of infections is better understood, epidemiologists say. The statistic typically cited by mayors and governors at COVID-19 news conferences relies on a dataset that includes mostly people whose symptoms were severe enough to be tested.
 Epidemiologists call it “severity bias.” It is why the fatality rate in Wuhan, China, where the outbreak began, was reported to be between 2% and 3.4% before it was revised to 1.4%, and it may yet be lower.
 One intriguing case study for epidemiologists looking for the true fatality rate is the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which became a kind of natural experiment when nearly all of its 3,711 passengers and crew members were tested for the coronavirus after an outbreak on board.
 The ship’s “case fatality rate,” which included only those who showed symptoms, was 2.6%, according to a study by researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, while the “infection fatality rate,” which included those who tested positive yet remained asymptomatic, was 1.3%. (A cruise ship, in which people are in a confined space, is not representative of the more dynamic situation in cities).
 The known number of coronavirus cases worldwide is about 2 million, and at least 127,000 of those patients have died. The United States has an estimated 600,000 reported cases and more than 25,000 deaths, the most in the world. But many people infected with the virus have no symptoms, or only mild ones, and appear in no official tally.

 The 28-year-old even went as far as to suggest that the title could be beyond United this term, but the quest for the Champions League remains a priority.
 "We need to do better as a team," Rooney told _BBC Sport_. "We're not in the best position but will keep fighting and keep going to get ourselves in as good a position as we can.
 "We know it's going to be extremely difficult to win the title, realistically top four has got to be our aim. Although we always want to win the league title, maybe it's a bit too far.
 "David Moyes is a fantastic manager, I worked with him at Everton and for a number of months at United. He's done everything he can but it's the players that have to do better and hopefully we can do that."
 There has been speculation about Rooney's future at Old Trafford, with his contract due to expire at the end of next season, but he is not letting the reports affect his focus.

For many athletes, the prospect of professional sports slowly emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic to resume play in empty sports complexes is reason for optimism.
 Sure, the stadiums and arenas will be devoid of the fan atmosphere that's so integral to the professional sports experience, but players currently sitting at home bingeing Netflix shows would be able to once again get their competitive juices flowing.
 A possible path back to competition recently put forth by Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States, also involves athletes and staff being sequestered in one location.
 "Nobody comes to the stadium. Put them in big hotels, wherever you want to play. Keep them very well-surveilled,'' Fauci said in an interview Wednesday on Snapchat. "Have them tested every single week and make sure they don't wind up infecting each other or their family, and just let them play the season out."
 For some athletes, that would mean living apart from their families — likely for an extended period of time.
 "Yeah, that would suck," said Vancouver Canucks defenceman Tyler Myers, who has a wife and young son. "There's so many high-stress situations throughout a season that one of the best parts is going home to your family. They're such a big part of your life and what you go through. They don't get talked about a lot in terms of how much they do for you in your hockey career. They're such a big part of your mental positivity.
 "That would definitely be tough."
 Fauci's scenario would require games to be played in a location with the necessary facilities willing to host events that will involve thousands of people to operate, even without fans in seats. Major League Baseball, for example, has been investigating a scenario where the league begins its delayed 2020 season by basing all 30 of its teams in the Phoenix area.
 "You'd have to think about it a little more seriously if it came to that, if the league presented that as the best option for us to finish the season and award a Stanley Cup," Montreal Canadiens defenceman Ben Chiarot said. "If they brought that to us as, 'This is our best option for getting this done,' then I think we'd to put more thought into it and really consider it.
 "If this is our best way to get the season done and get the Stanley Cup handed out, then that's what we have to do. It's not ideal, but I don't think anything about this whole situation is ideal or works for anybody in any way. We've had lots of times with our family this past month and months going forward — we're going to have lots of time — so if we have to be away for a little bit in order to get our jobs done ... then I think that would be what have to do."
 For Chiarot, being away from his family wouldn't be the only adjustment. He'd also have to get used to playing in a dead arena at a neutral site, instead of the raucous Bell Centre in hockey-mad Montreal.
 "A big bonus of playing in Montreal is our fans," Chiarot said. "It would be a missing aspect of being a Montreal Canadien."
 Of course, for some athletes the return to action would be too good to pass up.
 "It would definitely be crazy, especially with how used to it we are with having fans there and how much we feed off of them," said Winnipeg Jets goaltender Connor Hellebuyck, who was in the midst of an MVP-calibre season when the league went on hiatus on March 12 because of the novel coronavirus. "But just the fact that we'd get to play again would be awesome.
 "Just being on the ice and being able to play hockey would be awesome, and to know that we're definitely sharing our entertainment to the world again, that would be a good feeling. It would definitely be a little crazier, but I would still enjoy it."
 Norman Powell, who was having a breakout season with the defending NBA champion Toronto Raptors, said he would be open to any equitable scenario that gets him back on the court.
 "We're honestly just waiting to see what the people in charge are coming up with and what they deem necessary, and would be fair for everybody to have a chance to be able to play," Powell said. "I think that's one of the main focuses —trying to make sure the rest of the season, no matter what it looks like is fair for everybody, and they get the most out of the games and the players where everybody feels it's fair to compete, and have a shot to win the championship."
 A similar plan to bring international sports back online would face the additional hurdle of bringing in athletes from all over the world, with different countries having varying measures of success in the battle to contain the coronavirus. Still, there's the need for athletes on teams that have qualified for the Tokyo Olympics to get into competitive shape for when the Games kick off next summer.
 Ghislaine Landry, captain of Canada's women's rugby sevens squad, said she doesn't want to play in an empty stadium, but conceded it might be necessary for teams looking to win a medal in Tokyo.
 "Right now with the way everything's going, I can't imagine us travelling the world with all the other 12 teams (on the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series)," Landry said. "And if that's what it's going to take to get us playing again, at the end of the day this is going to become our Olympic year and we need to be playing rugby. So from a rugby standpoint, if that's what it has to be, that’s kind of the second-best option.
 "Safety and health come first. At this point, that's one of the toughest things. We don't know what the competition schedule is going to look like. We don't know when we're actually going to be back playing rugby. And for an athlete who has lived on training programs that work back from certain dates and plans to peak at certain dates, that's adding a pretty big kink into the plans."

The club's record goalscorer admits that off-field drama is commonplace at St James' Park, making Monday's announcement of Kinnear's resignation unsurprising news.
 But Shearer, who stepped in as caretaker when Kinnear left the manager's role in 2009, was surprised that the former Wimbledon boss was even given the director of football position in the first place.
 That move came about in June, when Kinnear game a now infamous radio interview in which he revealed his appointment prior to official confirmation from the club, and in the process pronounced a series of players' names wrong.
 "That's life at Newcastle United," Shearer told _BBC Radio 5 Live_.
 "I shouldn't say I'm surprised but I was surprised in the first place when he was announced director, particularly the way the news was broken when Joe himself announced it on the radio when he got some of the players' names wrong.
 "What has he been there now, about seven months? And two players have come in, albeit both players on loan.
 "Maybe it's Newcastle's way of trying to say that the performance on Saturday wasn't good enough and why they didn't get any new players in, maybe that's one of the reasons.
 "But they can only get players in if there's one man prepared to sign a chequebook."
 With Newcastle still licking their wounds following the 3-0 derby defeat to Sunderland, Shearer concedes that uncertainty continues to plague the Premier League club.
 "You just never know what goes on at Newcastle behind closed doors," he said.
 "I think we were all surprised because Joe had been out of football for so long. Let's say that we hope he's OK and it's nothing to do with ill-health but it's just bizarre sometimes at Newcastle.
 "Four, five weeks ago Newcastle were going so well, still in the FA Cup, Alan Pardew was getting manager of the month awards (and) they were looking up the league rather than finishing in mid-table.
 "It's amazing what happens in three or four weeks in football. The 3-0 on Saturday hurt everyone and they were second best all over the park with a lack of fight and a lack of desire from the players and now it's come to this."

 Davis said residents are used to natural disasters, as the county is no stranger to floods and snowstorms.

 Davis said he continues to try to educate the public about the virus, and a lot of people think they are going to get COVID-19.
 “This is a virus you have to come in contact with the droplets,” Davis said. “If someone sneezes or coughs without covering their mouth, the droplets could come in contact with another.”

 Minutes after a call to 9-1-1, a Gainesville Fire Rescue crew arrived and extinguished the flames. A short time later, workers from Gainesville Regional Utilities came to fix the damage. The power was only out for about a half-hour as repairs were done.
   
 The fire department and city-owned utility obviously aren't the only parts of government needed in the national emergency we're currently experiencing. That is why having a "well-functioning" government on all levels is so important right now.
   
 Not every local decision made in response to the pandemic has been perfect, but most residents would hopefully agree that local officials have rightly focused on keeping people safe. It helps to elect officials who believe in the value of government and have some experience doing the job.
   
 Contrast that with decisions made on the state and federal levels by people who lack that experience and are hostile to the very notion that government can be a power for good. A deadly virus is a brutal way to discover the value of electing competent people who care about something beyond their own interests.
   
 While it shouldn't have taken a pandemic to figure this out, there need to be some basic qualifications for elected office beyond sounding good on TV. Many of the nation's governors have experienced surging popularity in recent weeks as they have done well in managing the responses of their states to the pandemic, with Florida's governor being a notable exception.
   
 But the COVID-19 virus has also shown that competent government leaders aren't enough -- they also need to have competent people working for them, and to look to intelligent people in the private sector for advice and help. Of all the many lies that the president has said, his claim that "I alone can fix it" has turned out to be the most glaring and destructive.
   
 So as we move forward in the weeks ahead in repairing the damage caused by the novel coronavirus, competency and collaboration are both critical. And if the state and federal governments are going to continue to fall short on those fronts, local elected officials, public employees and other residents must keep working together to pick up the slack.
   
 A well-functioning government benefits us all, whether it's keeping us safe from a deadly virus or preventing our homes from going up in flames.

“This is going to allow us to make sure we’re all on the same page,” the governor said. “I’m really encouraged by what we’ve already seen from folks sending in their plans, moving away from who does business to how we do business and when.”
 The new May 1 date will bring the state in line with recent targets from the federal government to get the nation back to work at the start of next month.
 On Thursday, Indiana also joined a multi-state block for the Great Lakes region and will attempt to act in concert with what other states are doing in the region. Holcomb said that doesn’t mean Indiana will be tied to anyone else’s particular timeline, but that effort will be made to work closely with neighboring states.
 Holcomb noted that the date doesn’t necessarily mean things will suddenly open, but that Hoosiers and businesses will need to responsibly adapt to a return to work and more regular functioning. The state won’t go from stay-at- home one day to back to pre-coronavirus operating the next.
 “One of the worst things that could happen is we get this re-surge,” Holcomb said.

OUTLOOK: There is very little ever certain about what Seahawks will do in draft other than to expect first-round trade by GM John Schneider. Seahawks have not used their original first-round pick since 2011. Focus will undoubtedly be on defensive line, where Seattle’s pass rush lagged in 2019 and there remains uncertainty about Jadeveon Clowney returning. Expect Schneider to try to add extra pick or two with Seattle already having three picks (Nos. 27, 59, 64) in first two rounds.

Before the coronavirus-related travel restrictions were put into place, NFL teams saw some of the 300 top draft prospects run the 40-yard dash, bench press hundreds of pounds and run and defend pass routes at the college scouting combine in late February. They also have firsthand information on many other players who completed pro days before the league halted travel. But talent evaluators are still in the blind about hundreds of other college players who played at smaller schools, are recovering from injury or who received less playing time and could prove valuable to a team searching for lesser known prospects.
 In the past month, more NFL teams have been sending Slants video of dozens of plays from college games and asking for predictive statistics on players — particularly wide receivers, running backs and defensive backs. Some teams are using Slants’ findings to confirm data that their scouts collected in games or drills. In other cases, Slants is providing new information.
 “It kind of feels guilty to say with everything going on in the world, but it’s helped show people the value of this technology,” said Ali Shah, the company’s other co-founder.
 NFL teams are reluctant to openly discuss how they use the technology for fear of giving their rivals an advantage. But one person in charge of analytics at an NFL team who spoke on condition of anonymity said that he is using Slants to help evaluate some of the 3,000 or so college players he has tracked ahead of this year’s draft. His team also uses Pro Football Focus, which grades college players from the Power Five conferences. His staff also watches video to subjectively evaluate lesser known players.
 “But being in analytics, we think there’s a more scientific approach,” the team executive said. Slants’ video technology can estimate a player’s 40-yard speed, which “is incredibly useful to teams because speed and yards of separation are influential and predictive variables.”
 The first iterations of Slants’ software were developed three years ago by Ajmeri, who grew up a Washington Redskins fan in Maryland and dreamed of becoming an NFL general manager. He talked to Shah, his college friend, about how to help football teams become more efficient. The duo, who also follow basketball and soccer, believe football is not as advanced as other sports in using automated technology.

 And with the transfer window in Russia still open, Rubin have now made a move for the 25-year-old former Groningen man, who is now due to discuss personal terms and undergo a medical.
 PSV technical director Marcel Brands told the club's website: "Although Cocu would rather see the striker leave in summer, he feels confident that PSV have sufficient attackers, including Luciano Narsingh, Bryan Ruiz, Jurgen Locadia, Memphis Depay, Florian Jozefzoon and Zakaria Bakkali, to allow the deal to go through."
 Matavz joined PSV on a five-year deal from Groningen in August 2011.

WILMINGTON, N.C. (WECT) - Small businesses across the nation are suffering, and it’s no different in the Cape Fear.The U.S. Small Business Administration stopped taking new applications under the Paycheck Protection Program Thursday after nearly $350 billion were exhausted in just two weeks.U.S. Congressmen David Rouzer and Patrick McHenry hosted a call for business owners across the area to answer their questions Friday.If you did not receive a PPP loan from the Small Business Administration, there could be another chance to receive some help.U.S. Congressman Patrick McHenry (NC-10) said via conference call that the administration is working to approve another relief package.This one will likely provide $250 billion more for PPP loans.McHenry said he expects that to be passed sometime next week.Those loans were just one of the concerns small business owners and workers shared with Rouzer and McHenry.Others said a major problem was that businesses with preexisting relationships with banks were able to receive loans more easily, leaving many self-employed or independent contractors empty-handed.“Businesses that have accounting firms that do a lot of this type of work for them were going to the bankers immediately where they already had a relationship and there’s no question that those who already had a close relationship with the banks had their accountants working on this at the get-go those folks by and large they got their money early," Rouzer said.Both Rouzer and McHenry say the next round of funds will be first come, first serve – so if you already applied but did not receive a loan, you’ll need to do so again.“Get your information into your lender and have all of your ducks in a row because when the funds come there will be a rush to access the program so I would get in with your lender. The first course of action is to go to your existing banking relationship and if they have all your financials it should be a faster process,” McHenry said.Copyright 2020 WECT. All rights reserved.

After helping the Gallagher Chiefs to an impressive start to the Super Rugby season, Canada captain Tyler Ardron now finds himself in lockdown in New Zealand.
 New Zealanders can only leave their home for certain reasons, like going to the supermarket or pharmacy. People have to establish their "bubble," the people they can interact/live with, and police will sometimes stop people driving.
 "If you're not going straight from the store back home, you're in trouble basically," said Ardron.
 While the 28-year-old from Lakefield, Ont., has his own flat in downtown Hamilton, he often spent time with a local family he is close to. With the country's lockdown in its most severe mode, he has moved in with the family full-time.
 "They've got a nice little piece of land," he said. "We managed to get some good gym equipment, built a training area so I could stay in shape. And they've got three kids that are nine to 13 so it keeps us busy, for sure."
 It's the latest chapter in a whirlwind year that has seen Ardron lead Canada at the Rugby World Cup in Japan and captain the famed Barbarians invitational side.
 The lock/No. 8 is the first Canadian to play for a New Zealand-based Super Rugby side and only the third — following Christian Stewart and Jebb Sinclair — to play in the Southern Hemisphere's elite club competition.
 Given the current situation, he's not sure where the future lies but says this probably could be his last season in New Zealand. Prior to the shutdown, he signed a deal with a European team.
 "I'm excited to keep moving and travelling with my career right now," said Ardron, who declined to identify his next club because he had not completed the medical yet.
 His destination is reportedly Castres Olympique in France.
 Ardron signed with the Chiefs in 2017, making his debut the next year. He came to New Zealand from Wales, where he captained the Ospreys of the Guinness Pro 14 circuit.
 Today he is one of the Chiefs' three player-leaders, so is in regular contact with the New Zealand Rugby Players Association about rugby's future. With teams in Argentina, Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Africa, Super Rugby faces challenges in coming back any time soon due to travel and other restrictions.
 One possible option, once restrictions are lifted, is playing against New Zealand opposition — behind closed doors for TV purposes with visiting teams chartering in and out the day of the game.
 "The government, having rugby as their No 1 sport here, is pretty keen to use it as a bit of a recovery tool for the morale of the country," Ardron said. "But it's obviously just going to depend on the bigger picture."
 Super Rugby players have only taken a 15 per cent pay freeze so far, with the hope they will get the money at a later date once play resumes.
 The Chiefs, under new coach Warren Gatland, opened the 2020 season with three straight wins and were third in the New Zealand Conference with a 4-2-0 record when play was suspended March 19. And one of those losses, a 27-24 setback March 13 at the hands of the Hurricanes, came on an 84th-minute penalty after a 36-phase attack that lasted more than give minutes.
 For Ardron and the Chiefs, the suspension of play is a bitter pill given their successful start.
 "It was really exciting," he said. "It's tough to think the season could be over — well the season as we know it is over. It's just depending if we can get any different sort of competition within New Zealand up and going.
 "I really felt this was the year to win it. We had the team. Obviously some new coaching staff coming in has helped. We definitely had the belief. I think we would have been the team to beat."
 Ardron started four of the six games, a change from last season when he played the full 80 minutes in every match bar one. But Gatland, a celebrated coach whose resume includes Ireland, Wales and the British and Irish Lions, is keen on rotating his roster to rest players.
 Ardron's four years with the Ospreys came while Gatland coached Wales, so the Canadian was familiar with his style of play. And he played under Gatland in Barbarian colours against Fiji, Brazil and Wales last November.
 "I really got to know him then. You share a beer and get to know each other a bit better on a week like that. So I had a really good introduction and start with him but it's been even better having him here."
 Ardron captained the Barbarians against Brazil, the first Canadian to serve as skipper of the famed invitational side that dates back to 1890.
 "That was amazing — and pretty unexpected," said Ardron, who roomed with Rory Best.
 The Irish hooker captained the Baa-Baas at Twickenham against Fiji. And Ardron found out after the game that the reason he had been paired with Best was that he was taking over the captaincy in Sao Paulo.
 He did not forget his roots in doing so. While the Barbarians wear their trademark black-and-white hooped jersey, they are allowed to wear socks from a club of their own choosing. Ardron had a friend back home send him a set of socks from the Peterborough Pagans.
 Players in New Zealand spend a half-day a week outside of rugby, as mandated by the Players Association. So Ardron has more than a few strings to his bow.
 He has a degree in finance and economics and is a qualified yoga instructor. He also took a Toastmasters course and started learning the guitar. As a member of the Chiefs, he also had to master the haka — and songs in English, Fijian and Maori.
 "I really can't see myself not coming back here often when I retire, if I don't end up living here," he said. "I've had such a good time and made so many good connections."

Too Hot to Handle on Netflix is the spiritual successor to Love is Blind, and the new steamy dating show is now streaming on the service, just in time for the weekend.
 The Netflix series casts a number of gregarious, good-looking singles, sends them to an island resort, and asks them to cohabitate for a few weeks.
 The catch here, because these shows always need a catch to stay relevant, is that they can’t… canoodle. If they can abstain for physical intimacy for the length of the contest, they’ll win $100,000 - but hey, either way it’s a win- win amiright?
 The series has eight 40-minute episodes that all dropped today... which will likely be gobbled up and all over social media by the time Sunday rolls around.
 ## Does Netflix have the hots for trashy TV?
 So what's the deal with all these new dating shows on Netflix? While traditional cable has always relied on one or two of these types of shows to woo viewers during primetime, Netflix traditionally has strayed away from going there.
 But that seemingly changed with The Circle, a game show about catfishing your opponents through a pseudo social network, and also Love is Blind, which tasked contestants to go on a number of blind dates without seeing one another before picking a partner whom they’d marry at the end of the show.
 Honestly, you can't fault Netflix for falling into the same trap that other networks fall into - these shows are relatively cheap to make (there's no special effects or big-name actors) and they draw a lot of attention.
 While this one probably won't hook me personally, it's nice to see Netflix keeping others entertained during a particularly un-fun time.

With his side preparing to face Torino on Saturday, Seedorf has been impressed by Milan's application since he took over as coach in mid-January.      The Dutchman has guided Milan to consecutive Serie A wins and they sit ninth, still five points adrift of city rivals Inter and the final European place.      Seedorf said greater consistency was required from his team, but hailed the attitude they had shown since his arrival.      "It's important to take it day by day," he told reporters on Friday.      "I see enthusiasm and willingness in the team to learn and improve. All the ingredients are there to be able to grow and improve.      "We now need to find a consistency in both our results and our play. Tomorrow it will be nice to get back to San Siro in front of our fans, who have always supported us even through times of difficulty."      The clash at home to Torino shapes as an important one with Giampiero Ventura's men sixth in the league.      Seedorf said he knew what to expect of a Ventura-coached team, but believes Milan can be successful if at their best.      "We have analysed their team and we are trying to prepare how best to deal with what they have to offer," he said.      "We're also working on our strengths then we'll just see which team plays better.      "I've always liked Ventura's teams. They always have lots of possession. They are having a great season.      "Torino are a very pragmatic team so we need to have a very clear idea of what we want to do in the game."

SHREVEPORT, La. — Larry Evensky spent about two hours filling out an application for a small business loan through the Paycheck Protection Program, an effort by the federal government to help small business owners keep employees on the payroll during the recession created by the coronavirus.
 Evensky found out Thursday he couldn’t be approved for that loan. The $349 billion program had run out of money.
 According to data released by the Small Business Administration, 17,097 businesses in Louisiana were approved for loans through the Paycheck Protection Program through April 13. Those loans amounted to over $3.7 billion. Data analysts with Evercore determined that this only accounts for 45 percent of Louisiana’s eligible payroll.
 Evensky owns Transportation Provider Services, Inc., a trucking logistics company, based in a nondescript brick house on Line Avenue in Shreveport.
 Evensky said all but two of his seven employees have been able to work remotely.
 “(We’re) very lucky in the respect that we do most of our business via the phone and the internet,” Evensky said. “Somehow, as I like to say, we’re gonna keep on trucking.”
 While Evensky’s bottom line has taken a hit from a decrease in exports, he said he has the resources to continue operating. His concern is for neighboring businesses along Line Ave.
 “A lot of my neighbors, I’m sure, did probably need this (loan),” Evensky said. Right next door there’s a cleaners, a men’s shop and an interior decorator. I know these people are closed and it’s really going to put a hurt on them.”
 In the meantime, Evensky has transitioned much of his business toward food bank relief.
 “I ship a lot of rice and cotton — products like that,” Evensky said. “I know that if you probably go to the store, basic staples like rice is off the shelf now. So in that regard, we’re shipping a lot of that and I’d like to hope that the bottom line is we’re feeding some people.”
 Rep. Steve Scalise said Thursday that Congress is considering a fourth aid package, which is expected to include more money for the Paycheck Protection Program. Evensky hopes small businesses can continue to have a voice in these conversations moving forward.
 “I’m not trying to get into any political — but it kind of chaps me that some huge companies — the airlines for instance, are going to get bailed out… while we’re paying exorbitant prices to fly wherever you need to go,” Evensky said. “They’re getting the bailout and small companies are not.”

The Welsh side's difficult season took another turn for the worse on Saturday as Ben Watson's piledriver handed Wigan a place in the quarter-finals of the competition they won last year.
 Cardiff currently sit second from bottom in the Premier League table, with only 12 games left to play.
 Solskjaer - who took over from the sacked Malky Mackay in January - has picked up just four points from a possible 18 since taking over the helm.
 But he was keen to look forward after the 2-1 cup exit, and insists that he is simply focused on keeping Cardiff up.
 "We are out of the cup now so there is only one thing we have to concentrate on and that is the league," he said.
 "I'm made in a way that I always try to see something positive, even in a defeat like this if you can. Today is not easy as we thought we had a chance to go all the way. The league and survival in the top flight is now what we have to concentrate on."
 Cardiff had their chances to extend their cup progress, with Wilfried Zaha particularly lively after Chris McCann's 17th-minute opener had been cancelled out by Fraizer Campbell.
 But Watson's strike was simply unstoppable, after the ball was touched to him from a free-kick, and the former Manchester United striker conceded that his team had been masters of their own downfall.
 "We are out of the cup so there is nothing more to say, we are disappointed," Solskjaer added.
 "We thought we were in with a chance here today and we were as we created chances, but we didn't take them.
 "But we conceded a poor first goal - it was a stupid foul to give away as we should have got it away.
 "With the second goal, there was nothing we could do because it was a wonder strike.
 "We play the percentages and it might go for us but it didn't today. I can't fault the effort - it was a top spirit given by everybody.
 "It was just one of these days and we just rue the missed opportunities."

With an increased demand for personal protective equipment for frontline medical staff during the COVID-19 crisis, an unlikely local supplier has emerged.
   
 The classroom and supplies for Gorillas Robotics Team 1225, housed at the Boys & Girls Club of Henderson County, are being used to make up to 15 medical grade-compliant face shields each day at the club.
   
 They are being donated to those fighting the pandemic, beginning with Pardee Hospital and AdventHealth Hendersonville, according to a news release from the club.
   
 Billy Freeman, a club staff member, leads the club's S.T.E.M. programs and also works with the Gorillas. Although the team is not meeting with teen members due to social distancing orders, Freeman has been utilizing the recently closed robotics classroom to produce the shields.
   
 "After learning of the need at medical facilities, I decided to get to work. Our 3-D printers have been running full tilt ever since," Freeman said, adding that he plans to continue production as long as the need is present and printers will print.
   
 Amy Treece, Pardee's Community and Government Relations officer, said this type of help is more critical than ever.
   
 "Face shields are one of the most important pieces of PPE that our staff uses to care for COVID-19 patients, and this donation will make a huge difference. This is an amazing chapter in the story of how the Boys and Girls Club helps our community," Treece stated in the release.
   
 Sherri Holbert, Foundation director for Advent Health, echoed those sentiments.
   
 "We absolutely welcome this donation. We are so grateful for this amazing support of our frontline caregivers," Holbert said.
   
 As Henderson County's high school robotics team, the Gorillas' mission is to advance S.T.E.A.M (science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics) education in the community, in addition to advancing through robotics competitions.
   
 The club has hosted the team, providing classroom space and other supports, since 2018.
   
 While the club suspended traditional youth programs March 16 in keeping with the governor's executive order, several other collaborative initiatives have been set in motion to support youth and families during social distancing.
   
 These include providing limited child care for children of first responders in partnership with Henderson County Public Schools and serving as a Meals on the Bus meal distribution site.
   
 The club also partners with the Backpack Program to distribute non-perishable groceries to families in need every Friday.
   
 "I am grateful for the caring, innovative people of this Club and for our community partners who provide creative supports that are outside-of-the-box," said club Executive Director Julia Hockenberry.
   
 "These are things we can do in this moment as we prepare for a future of meeting the new, intensified needs of families and children affected by COVID-19."

“We had maybe five ideas of where football is lagging behind, where it feels more old school than new school,” Shah said.
 Ajmeri worked as an intern at the NFL in the summer of 2013 and had a feel for how the league worked, and Shah, a computer programmer who roots for the New York Jets, helped translate their ideas into software.
 Their first public validation came in 2018, when they presented their technology at the influential MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference. A panel of outside judges gave them an “Alpha Award” for best research paper. At the conference, they met representatives from NFL teams who were looking to automate the often ponderous task of tagging game footage. Several teams continued to work with Slants and provide them with tips on what NFL teams need, including ways to evaluate college players.
 Ajmeri and Shah sought to replicate the statistics that NFL teams collect from their own players, who all wear radio-frequency identification (or RFID) chips in their shoulder pads so that antennas and beacons in stadiums can track their movements on the field. Colleges do not use this technology yet, another reason pro teams rely so heavily on collecting their own data to size up players.
 “At the end of the day, we have the NFL data and can process it, but there’s nothing like it on the college level,” said Tyler Oberly, who worked with Slants when he ran the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ analytics department from 2014 to 2019.
 The big leap for Slants came in mid-2018, when Omar’s younger brother, Ameen, joined and used his skills in machine learning to teach the software to compensate for different camera angles and other variables.

Adel Taarabt's debut goal had given Clarence Seedorf's Milan an early lead on Saturday, but Napoli were not to be denied a deserved victory.
 Gokhan Inler equalised soon after, and Higuain struck twice after half-time to take his Serie A goal tally to 12 for the season and give Rafael Benitez's men their first league win since a 3-0 triumph at Verona on January 12.
 Napoli, who were beaten by Atalanta in Serie A last weekend and Roma in semi- final of the Coppa Italia in midweek, dominated from start to finish and are now only three points behind second-placed Roma - who have two games in hand.
 Defeat for Milan was their first in the league since Seedorf took over as coach last month, but the Dutchman may count his blessings that his side were not beaten by a more handsome margin.
 Napoli defender Faouzi Ghoulam replaced the injured Anthony Reveillere and Dries Mertens came in for Jose Callejon, who started on the bench along with January signing Henrique.
 Michael Essien and Taarabt made their Milan debuts, while striker Mario Balotelli returned from suspension as Seedorf made six changes to the side that drew with Torino last weekend.
 Napoli made a bright start, but they were caught out after only seven minutes when QPR loanee Taarabt raced forward before placing a measured right-foot strike into the far corner of the net from just outside the area as the home defence backed off.
 The goal was harsh on Benitez's team, but they were level three minutes later courtesy of a fine left-foot strike from Inler that took a deflection and looped over Christian Abbiati.
 Milan struggled to cope with Napoli's attacking threat, and Higuain was inches away from putting the home side in front when his shot flashed wide of the far post.
 Abbiati was lucky to escape with only a yellow card after 22 minutes when he rushed out of his area and upended Mertens after the winger had raced onto a through ball and attempted to lob the veteran goalkeeper.
 To add insult to injury, Abbiati kept out the resulting free-kick from the Belgium international, before Marek Hamsik's venomous left-foot volley flashed just wide.
 Christian Maggio then hit the post from a tight angle and Lorenzo Insigne headed just wide as Milan somehow went in level at the break.
 Kaka replaced fellow Brazilian Robinho at half-time, but his introduction failed to turn the tide as Napoli maintained the upper hand and Abbiati could only watch on as Insigne's strike flashed wide.
 It was only a matter of time before the home side took the lead, and it was former Real Madrid man Higuain who put them in front when he headed home an inviting cross from Inler 11 minutes into the second half.
 The Argentina striker was a constant menace and he ought to have given Napoli breathing space but missed his kick after evading the vulnerable Philippe Mexes.
 Napoli could have been made to pay for not making their dominance count but Taarabt's strike was kept out by Pepe Reina and then Balotelli failed to capitalise after the Spanish goalkeeper had totally missed his kick.
 Higuain sealed the points with eight minutes left, though, slotting home from close range after Callejon picked him out.

 "I did say beforehand Giampiero Ventura’s teams are very well-organised and we saw that again tonight," he told _Sky Sport Italia_.
 "As for my team, we had a little more patience in the second half to spread the play and that made the difference.
 "In the first half Torino were still a little deep, so (Keisuke) Honda tried to break through, but you have to spread the play to stretch out opposition defences.
 "It requires patience and my players had more of that after the break, forcing the opponents to move out of position."
 Milan remain ninth in Serie A after the draw and face third-placed Napoli in the league on Saturday.
