If you are part of one of those, count your blessings and then go help others. Include contacting your government representatives demanding they pass legislation for immediate aid targeted to...

Polls show that the public overwhelmingly approve of how the Chancellor has handled the coronavirus crisis. Sunak has recently borrowed Labour’s ‘green industrial revolution’ language, and now we’ve seen him nick the “jobs, jobs, jobs” phrase. He is splashing the cash relative to normal times and normal Tory behaviour. He is making overtures to those worried about the environment and the impact of the Covid-19 recession on young people. Labour seems to have set itself a challenge: highlight where support is still lacking without sounding unappreciative of the vast sums being put forward and the unprecedented nature of the crisis. The danger is that the opposition party, on the back of a disastrous general election defeat, is too worried about undermining its own credibility to call for the scale of ambition now needed.

Oggi compiamo insieme un altro passo affatto trascurabile nella direzione della diversificazione produttiva e della promozione positiva del nostro territorio. La struttura del Cineporto ci consentira di accrescere la competitivita e l'attrattivita di Taranto nei confronti dell'industria cinematografica e presto il Comune di Taranto sara formalmente socio di Apulia Film Commission. Confidiamo che anche il protocollo che stiamo sottoscrivendo con la bella realta di Afo6 si dimostri utile a sviluppare professionalita, progetti sociali e grandi eventi in questo frangente». Cosi il sindaco di Taranto durante la presentazione del cineporto allestito nel rione Porta Napoli, gestito dall'associazione AFO6 con il patrocinio e il supporto economico di Apulia Film Commission. L'inaugurazione parziale riguarda il primo piano della struttura (sede degli uffici e delle sale tecniche), mentre al piano terra sono ancora in corso i lavori. "Taranto - ha sottolineato l'assessore alle Industrie Culturali   e Turistiche della Regione Puglia - non e solo Ilva, Taranto e molto di piu e merita giustizia. Per questa ragione, con il presidente Emiliano, abbiamo voluto trasferirvi Medimex, la piu importante Fiera regionale dedicata alla musica e agli operatori di tutta la filiera. Per questo oggi inauguriamo la sede del Cineporto. L'abbiamo voluto, e stato un grande lavoro di squadra, e adesso che ci siamo l'emozione non si tiene». Per Simonetta Dellomonaco, Presidente dell'Apulia Film Commission, «'apertura di un Cineporto a Taranto rappresenta una nuova partenza per il cinema pugliese. Questo territorio e prezioso non solo come location cinematografica ma anche per la crescita del comparto cine-audiovisivo. Taranto e ricca di bravi professionisti, maestranze e artisti del settore, in grado di contribuire significativamente allo sviluppo cinematografico regionale».   Il direttore artistico Michele Riondino ha detto che «questa casa del cinema e la casa di tutti ed e importante che sia nata, che nasca oggi a Taranto una una realta come questa. Non devono passare narrazioni sbagliate, l'ultima qualche qualche mese fa che ci descrive come un territorio difficile. Taranto non e un territorio difficile dove girare film. Ormai da diversi anni puntiamo sulla cultura, su un modello di rinascita culturale di cui questa citta ha bisogno perche e nella sua natura». La cultura di Taranto, ha concluso Riondino, «non e fatta d'acciaio ma e fatta di note musicali. Taranto e una citta musicale prima ancora che cinematografica».

Leeds [UK], July 8 (ANI): Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has hailed Bruno Fernandes saying that since joining the club, the 25-year-old has "lifted everyone".   "I think it's gone both ways. Bruno has come into the club, seen how many good players there are at Manchester United, that we've helped him and how his attributes are as well, and it's been a good little relationship blossoming and he can also feel we help him improve," Goal.com quoted Solskjaer as saying.   "He's come in and lifted everyone and it's been a very, very good start so far," he added.   Since Fernandes' arrival at Manchester United from Sporting CP, he has delivered brilliant performances. He has recorded seven goals and six assists in his first 14 outings in United colours.   Manchester United have not suffered even a single defeat since they returned to action following the coronavirus-enforced break.   The Solskjaer-led side currently holds the fifth spot on Premier League with 55 points, just four points behind the fourth-placed club Leicester City. The club will next take on Aston Villa on July 10. (ANI)

London [UK], July 8 (ANI): Despite failing to clinch three points from a game against Leicester City, Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said he is "extremely proud" of his side's performance during the match.   "I think for long periods of the game we deserved the three points, 100 percent, but against this opposition when you have them there you have to kill them. We should have scored three or four goals and then the game is over and we haven't done that, and after as well you let the team down with 10 men and obviously to win three points by doing these two things becomes really complicated," the club's official website quoted Arteta as saying.   "But overall I'm extremely proud and happy with what I've seen from the players, the way we played, the way we dominated this type of opponent, and it's not easy to do after the amount of games we've played in the last few days," he added.   Arsenal were restricted to a 1-1 draw by Leicester City in the ongoing Premier League here on Wednesday.   Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored the opening goal of the match in the 21st minute, handing Arsenal a 1-0 lead. Arsenal managed to maintain the lead until the 84th minute of the match as Jamie Vardy's stunning goal ended Arsenal's hopes to secure their fifth straight win.   Arsenal are currently on the seventh spot on the Premier League table with 50 points. The club will next take on Tottenham on Sunday. (ANI)
