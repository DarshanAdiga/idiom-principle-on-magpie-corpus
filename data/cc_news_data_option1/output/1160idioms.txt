We live in a truth-challenged era. Writers are a window both ways, through which we peer at who the authors are. The Wizard of Oz wears no clothes. Looking back to earlier crossroads where fact and fantasy met and shook hands, Charles Dickens was one of the first to deliver the lived truth of the underdogs of society embedded in fictionalized and stylized narrative.


  Social justice writers who followed lacked Dickens’ hard-won authenticity. John Steinbeck won a Nobel Prize for The Grapes of Wrath, but lifted much of its grit from field notes by Sanora Babb of the Farm Security Administration, whose supervisor shared her observations with Steinbeck when he wrote for the San Francisco News. He went right to the wine without stomping the grapes.


  In the same year he won the Nobel, Steinbeck published “Travels with Charley,” his ostensibly nonfiction 10,000-mile journey with his standard poodle. In the words of Steinbeck’s son, “He just sat in his camper and wrote all that (expletive).”


  We are now busy parsing who has the right to tell a story, whether believable or not. Our conversations are cloaked in political correctness over plain- spokenness. Consider Jeanine Cummins’ bestselling novel “American Dirt” and Oprah Winfrey’s disavowal of the Sundance documentary “On the Record,” which tells Time’s Up tales of hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons. Two of today’s tempests in a teapot, they are a looking glass through which we have crashed full-frontal, shards of a society beset by factually challenged thought- leaders.


  Cummins’ novel puts vivid flesh on the immigrant crisis at the border. The novelist is Hispanic, if not Mexican — her apparent failing — and gathered five years of location research, which is five more than Steinbeck did. Yet her “right” to tell the story came under fire even before the novel’s release. In a PC pile-on, a Sunday New York Times book reviewer found much to admire, but caved to the temper of the times, feeling “deeply ambivalent. Perhaps this book is an act of cultural imperialism.”

La France se prépare à prolonger le confinement de sa population, au moment où les présidents français Emmanuel Macron et chinois Xu Jinping ont appelé lundi à un sommet du G20 sur les aspects sanitaire et économique de la crise du coronavirus.


  "Les deux présidents se sont accordés sur le fait que la tenue d’un tel sommet serait utile en particulier sur le plan sanitaire, en associant l'OMS pour travailler conjointement sur les traitements et le vaccin", a indiqué la présidence française.


  Un sommet du G20 serait également utile "sur le plan économique (stabilisation de l'économie mondiale par des mesures coordonnées sur le plan budgétaire et monétaire; soutien aux Etats les plus vulnérables)", a-t-on ajouté.


  En France, deux nouveaux médecins, du Haut-Rhin et de Haute-Saône, sont décédés dimanche des suites d'une contamination au coronavirus, portant à cinq le nombre de médecins morts du virus dans l'hexagone.


  M. Macron a fait part de son opposition à un "confinement total" de la population française tout en jugeant nécessaire un contrôle plus strict des mesures actuelles, que le Premier ministre devrait expliquer ce lundi au 20H00 de TF1.


  Un nouvel avis du Conseil scientifique est attendu mardi sur les conditions du confinement, et celui-ci devrait très probablement être prolongé au-delà de la période initiale de 15 jours.


  Le président Macron, qui a réuni par audioconférence les représentants des cultes, a indiqué que les fêtes religieuses d'avril (Pâques juive et chrétienne, début du ramadan) devront se faire "sans rassemblement".


  "Il y a quelques centaines de soignants en Île-de-France qui sont positifs" au Covid-19, a affirmé lundi sur France Inter le professeur Philippe Juvin, chef du service des urgences à l'hôpital Georges-Pompidou de Paris.


  Quand arrivera le pic de l'épidémie? Si Philippe Juvin n'a "aucune visibilité" sur le sujet, l'infectiologue et ancien chef de service à la Pitié-Salpêtrière François Bricaire le prévoit d'ici "une huitaine de jours".


  "Je ne suis pas persuadé qu'il faut durcir" le confinement, a-t-il ajouté sur LCI, expliquant que le "restez chez vous" était "suffisant".


  -le couvre-feu s'étend-

  Certains maires ont pris des mesures radicales. Dans la Drôme, Valence est passée au couvre-feu depuis samedi soir, de 21H00 à 06H00, jusqu’au 31 mars.


  Le couvre-feu est également en vigueur à Mulhouse, à Perpignan, à Charleville-Mézières (Ardennes) et sur tout le littoral des Alpes-Maritimes. Au total, plus d'une trentaine de villes sont soumises au couvre-feu.


  Sur près de 1,8 million de contrôles, les forces de l'ordre ont relevé plus de 90.000 infractions pour non-respect des restrictions depuis leur mise en place mardi, selon Alain Thirion, directeur général de la sécurité civile et de la gestion des crises.


  Conséquence de ce respect aléatoire: les sanctions ont été durcies. Les 135 euros d'amende forfaitaire passeront à 1.500 euros en cas de récidive "dans les 15 jours", et "quatre violations dans les trente jours" pourront valoir "3.700 euros d'amende et six mois de prison au maximum".


  \- TGV gratuits -


  Concernant les aides à apporter aux soignants, la présidente de la région Ile-de-France Valérie Pécresse a annoncé la commande de 20 millions de masques de protection. Son homologue des Hauts-de-France, Xavier Bertrand, a proposé de son côté la création d'un numéro d'aide psychologique pour "soulager la pression" des personnes angoissées.

  Le ministre des Comptes publics, Gérald Darmanin, a souhaité quant à lui que les salariés prennent des congés payés pendant le confinement afin de pouvoir travailler plus une fois l'épidémie terminée.


  \- Tester la chloroquine -


  Concernant l'utilisation de tests, réservés actuellement à certaines catégories (personnes fragiles, âgées, femmes enceintes, etc.), le gouvernement envisage pouvoir les "multiplier", mais seulement à la fin du confinement.


  Du côté des traitements, un essai clinique européen a démarré dimanche dans au moins sept pays pour quatre traitements expérimentaux.


  Concernant la chloroquine, l'un de ces traitements testés, "il faut très très rapidement qu’on sache si c’est efficace et qu’on produise très massivement ce produit dès maintenant", a affirmé le professeur Philippe Juvin.


  De très nombreuses personnes se pressaient lundi devant l'IHU Méditerranée Infection, pôle d'expertise marseillais sur les maladies infectieuses, pour se faire tester par les équipes du professeur Didier Raoult qui préconise ce traitement à la chloroquine.

Covid-19: Authorities Take Stock of Situation at Migrant Camps in Jammu | LatestLY


--DocBreak--
LONDON -- Britain sent in the army to deliver protective equipment to hospitals on Monday and told people to stay at home and heed warnings over social distancing or the government would bring in more extreme measures to stop the coronavirus spread.


  With some doctors saying they felt like "cannon fodder," the government said the military would help ship millions of items of personal protective equipment (PPE) including masks to healthcare workers who have complained of shortages.


  Deaths from the virus in Britain jumped to 335 on Monday as authorities step up action to try to limit the spread of the disease and prevent a repeat of the death toll seen in other countries where thousands have died.


  Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to update the public later on Monday, but not through his usual news conference, a BBC reporter said.


  In a letter pleading with Johnson to increase PPE supplies, more than 6,000 frontline doctors said they were being asked to put their lives at risk with out-of-date masks, and low stocks of equipment.


  Health Secretary Matt Hancock admitted there had been issues but promised action was being taken. He said the army would drive trucks throughout the day and night to get supplies to medical staff.


  "It's like a war effort - it is a war against this virus and so the army have been incredibly helpful in getting those logistics so we can get the supplies to protect people on the front line," he told the BBC, saying the health service now had 12,000 ventilators, 7,000 more than at the start of the crisis.


  Later on Monday, Britain's lower house of parliament is expected to approve emergency legislation giving authorities sweeping powers to tackle the outbreak, including the right to detain people and put them in isolation to protect public health.


  Britain has already brought in measures to try to curb the spread of the virus.


  On Monday, a much-reduced rail service was introduced and jury trials were suspended, coming days after Johnson advised Britons to work from home if possible and ordered the closure of pubs, gyms and leisure centers.


  Other businesses are shutting their doors voluntarily as demand collapses.


  Fashion and homeware retailer Next said it will close its stores as of 1800 GMT on Monday until further notice, while bakery chain Greggs and department store John Lewis said they would do the same.


  ADVICE IGNORED


  But advice to stay at home and avoid social gatherings went unheeded by millions at the weekend who took advantage of sunny weather to flocked to parks and beauty spots over the weekend, ignoring instructions to stay 2 meters (6 feet) apart.


  Emyr Williams, chief executive of the Snowdonia National Park Authority in Wales, said the past 24 hours had been unprecedented.


  "We have experienced the busiest visitor day in living memory. The area has been overwhelmed with visitors," he said.


  The government warned that Britain would face a shutdown with curfews and travel restrictions if people continued to flout the advice.


  "Well, we're perfectly prepared to do that if we need to because the objective here is really clear which is to stop the spread of the virus," Hancock told Sky News.


  The closure of non-essential shops comes as Britain opened the first part of a 330 billion pound ($384 billion) loan guarantee scheme for businesses to help small and medium-sized firms borrow up to 5 million pounds to deal with coronavirus stoppages.


  UK banks are in a "strong position" to further support an economy that will rebound from the epidemic, the Bank of England and leading lenders said in a joint statement.

 “I’ve been speaking to players — including two or three very high-profile Premier League players more or less on a daily basis — and the conversations I had with them at the outset were based around not wanting to play behind closed doors if at all possible,” Barnes, who also sits on the board of international players’ union FIFPro and UEFA’s Strategic Council told the Athletic.

Manchester City may not have had the Premier League season they were hoping for, but the emergence of some means the future appears bright.
 City have a star-studded side but some have called for them to freshen up a squad that has, at times, looked stale this campaign.
 Perhaps the freshening-up is already at their doorstep with Phil Foden potentially leading the way.
 The young Englishman has long been touted to be David Silva’s replacement and given how the Spaniard is leaving at the end of the season, it’s now or never.
 Foden isn’t just a City fan’s wishful thinking, however, as he is one of four English players to make CIES Football Observatory’s ten most valuable players born on or after the year 2000.
 The remaining players are Manchester United’s Mason Greenwood, Chelsea’s Callum Hudson-Odoi and Borussia Dortmund’s Jadon Sancho - so is clearly among the right type of footballer.
 Foden came in at 9th place with a value of €50m as he continues to attempt to cement his place in the starting XI.

All the while? The tournament itself endured.


  For me, though, it hit home because I realized how much the IHSAA tournament has been a part of my own life journey. I know I’m not alone in feeling this way.


  Professionally, I’ve covered high school basketball from the start. From my first game at Southern Wells in 1992 (I think Eastbrook was the opponent?) to my last one at Vincennes Lincoln, I’ve seen most corners of the state via high school basketball. I’ve written about now-legendary players and coaches. I’ve seen the sunset over corn fields on my way to a gym, and inspired by the idyllic tableau, was proud I was at least a small part of a greater tradition.


  I’ve driven through blizzards, record cold snaps (I covered a game early in my career where the air temperature was minus-30. Look it up, it was during the 1994 cold snap). I had a game canceled mid-stream at Zionsville due to a leaky roof. I once saw a Scottsburg cheerleader take a swing at a Jeffersonville point guard who had chased down a loose ball and accidentally knocked her over. She got her swing in when he helped her up!


  I love the gyms. I love seeing a new one. I love seeing the groundswell of enthusiasm when a team makes a run and makes it to a sectional championship. For all of the stupid arguing over the years about class basketball champions? With very, very few exceptions, for all schools, big and small, it’s always been about winning a sectional. Everything afterwards was gravy.


  It’s personal, too.


  I moved to Indiana while I was in high school in 1986. I was lucky to move into a school (Lawrence North) that won the state championship my senior year. Without really appreciating it in the moment, I was fortunate enough to experience all of the lore of the tournament on a very personal level.


  I got to storm the court at Hinkle Fieldhouse three times, just like in “Hoosiers.” I still get emotional when I watch the Hickory kids storm the court in “Hoosiers” because I’ve literally done it in the same place, and in the regional, via a buzzer-beater from the same spot on the floor that Jimmy Chitwood hit his fictional game-winner.


  I think back on that time and how lucky I was. I also think of the current seniors and feel heartbroken they won’t get the same moments. Unlike their college big brothers, there’s no eligibility relief to stop the clock.


  I think the fact I have a daughter who is a senior and is missing out on her own senior experiences drives home the heartbreak that much more.


  It’s not fair. It’s not just. Life is unfair, we all know that, but life has never been so unfair as to take Hoosier Hysteria away from us.


  Are there more important things to worry about right now? Of course, but this still hurts. We don’t have to spare our sadness only for the most serious moments in life. Losing the IHSAA boys basketball tournament is where the sadness hit home for me.

New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo on Monday said there is a need to ensure "economic viability" and pivot to a more functional economy, saying he is looking into whether young people and those immune to the virus can resume work sooner. His statement came as the total number of deaths due to coronavirus crossed 15,000 globally. Over 341,300 cases have been registered in 174 countries and territories since the epidemic first emerged in China in December.


  "There has to be a balance or parallel tracks that we're going down. We're talking about public health, we're talking about isolation, we're talking about protecting lives. There also has to be a parallel track that talks about economic viability," Cuomo said at a press conference. "I take total responsibility for shutting off the economy in terms of essential workers. But we also have to start to plan the pivot back to economic functionality. You can't stop the economy forever," he said.


  Cuomo added that there is a need to think about whether everyone stays out of work and for how long. "Should young people go back to work sooner. Can we test for those who had the virus, resolve and are now immune. And can they start to go back to work," he said, referring to a theory of risk stratification, which states that it is important to isolate the vulnerable people and not isolate everyone.


  "And if you isolate all people, you may be actually exposing the more vulnerable people by bringing in a person who is healthier and stronger and who may have been exposed to the virus... Can you get to a point where the healthy people who are most likely not going to be affected can go to work," the Governor said. He underscored that studying the numbers across the countries of people that have been infected, it has been established that the survival rate for those who have been infected is 98 per cent.


  "A lot of people get it. Very few people die from it. So how do we start to calculate that," he said. Cuomo has implemented the New York State on PAUSE executive order, a 10-point policy to assure safety for everyone.


  It includes a new directive that all non-essential businesses statewide must close in-office personnel functions effective at 8 PM on Sunday and temporarily bans all non-essential gatherings of individuals of any size for any reason. When in public, individuals must practice social distancing of at least six feet from others and young people should also practice social distancing and avoid contact with vulnerable populations.


  He said the state has implemented New York Pause and "we have to start to think about New York forward" that will require thinking about how to restart or transition to a restart of the economy. "And how do you dovetail that with a public health strategy. As you're identifying people who have had the virus, and have resolved, can they start to go back to work. Can younger people start to go back to work because they're much more tolerant to the effect of the virus. You turned off the engine quickly. How do you now start or begin to restart or plan the restart of that economic engine," he said.


  Cuomo said New York has tested 78,000 cases and as on Sunday, about 25 per cent of all the testing nationwide is being produced in New York. New York state has about 20,000 positive cases state-wide. Currently 13 per cent of the cases are hospitalised and of this, 24 per cent require ICU and ventilator facilities.

LONDON -- Britain was to announce new measures on Monday to halt the spread of coronavirus, potentially adding fresh restrictions to an already unprecedented clampdown on daily life, as the army stepped in to deliver protective equipment to hospitals.


  With some doctors saying they felt like "cannon fodder," the government said the military would help ship millions of items of personal protective equipment (PPE) including masks to healthcare workers who have complained of shortages.


  Deaths from the virus in Britain jumped to 335 on Monday as Prime Minister Boris Johnson prepared to lay out new measures in an address at 2030 GMT, which replaces his daily news conference.


  In a letter pleading with Johnson to increase PPE supplies, more than 6,000 frontline doctors said they were being asked to put their lives at risk with out-of-date masks, and low stocks of equipment.

  Fashion and homeware retailer Next said it will close its stores as of 1800 GMT on Monday until further notice, and bakery chain Greggs and department store John Lewis said they would follow suit.


  ADVICE IGNORED


  Advice to stay at home and avoid social gatherings went unheeded by millions at the weekend who took advantage of sunny weather to flock to parks and beauty spots, ignoring instructions to stay 2 meters (6 feet) apart.


  Emyr Williams, chief executive of the Snowdonia National Park Authority in Wales, said the past 24 hours had been unprecedented.


  The government has warned that Britain would face a shutdown with curfews and travel restrictions if people continued to flout the advice.


  "We're perfectly prepared to do that if we need to because the objective here is really clear, which is to stop the spread of the virus," Hancock told Sky News.


  The closure of non-essential shops came as Britain opened the first part of a 330 billion pound ($384 billion) loan guarantee scheme for businesses to help small and medium-sized firms borrow up to 5 million pounds to deal with coronavirus stoppages.


  UK banks are in a "strong position" to further support an economy that will rebound from the epidemic, the Bank of England and leading lenders said in a joint statement.

CNN) -- Bed Bath and Beyond announced Sunday it plans to close all Bed Bath and Beyond brand stores in the United States and Canada until April 3, as the coronavirus pandemic continues.


  The company indicated its buybuy Baby and Harmon Face Value stores are not included in the updated closure. It said it will provide pay and benefits to affected employees during this time.


  "Our number one priority is the health and safety of our customers and associates," said Mark Tritton, the company's president and CEO. "We will do our part to slow the spread of this virus by closing the vast majority of stores across our retail operations."


  Previously, Bed Bath and Beyond planned to temporarily close around 800 of its stores, with another 700 stores continuing to operate under shortened hours.


  Bed Bath & Beyond has struggled to remain competitive against Amazon, Target and other retailers in recent years, posting a string of weak sales, including during last year's holiday season.


  "In this time of great uncertainty, our first priority is the welfare of our customers and associates. We are therefore taking this decisive action to help keep our communities safe, while continuing to serve our loyal customers," CEO Mark Tritton said in a statement.


  The company was slow to announce closures, even as department store and home goods' rivals like Macy's, Nordstrom, JCPenney and others shut their doors. TJX, the parent company of TJMaxx and Marshalls, announced earlier on Thursday that it will close for two weeks. Kohl's also plans to close stores Thursday.


  While grocery stores, big box chains, wholesale clubs and pharmacies remain open, there is confusion around which stores should be considered "non- essential" and close. Home improvement stores such as Home Depot and Lowe's remain open. Best Buy is limiting the number of customers in stores to 15 at a time.


  The National Retail Federation sent a letter to President Trump Thursday requesting clarification on which stores can remain open. "There remains a need for clear national guidance to resolve questions caused by a number of conflicting state and local orders," the trade group said.


  Leonard Marcus, co-director of the National Preparedness Leadership Initiative at the Harvard School of Public Health, said earlier Thursday that keeping Bed Bath & Beyond and other non-essential stores open "does raise the risks to employees and customers. We are at a dangerous point in the spread of the coronavirus."


  Bed Bath & Beyond workers had previously voiced frustration at the company's decision to keep stores open earlier this week


  "We have no idea what is going on, we feel abandoned, and all our district and regional support are working from home," said one employee in Connecticut who, like others, spoke under the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation. "Associates are scared, frustrated, and have lost faith in the company to do the right thing and support us."

India reported two COVID-19 deaths on Monday, taking the death toll to nine, and the number of cases climbed to 468 after 95 people tested positive for coronavirus, the highest jump in one day, as Maharashtra and Punjab were put under statewide curfews, the rest of the country in lockdown and all domestic flights set to be grounded. The Union health ministry said West Bengal and Himachal Pradesh reported a casualty each on Monday, taking the total number of deaths to nine in the country due to COVID-19. Seven deaths were earlier reported from Gujarat, Bihar and Maharashtra (2), Karnataka, Delhi, and Punjab.


  The ministry also said the total number of cases rose to 468, including 424 active cases. There were 329 active cases on Sunday evening. \RThe extreme measures by the central and state governments were taken in light of the continued upward trajectory of the virus, amid warning of legal action against those violating the restrictions imposed during the lockdown. Punjab on Monday became the first in the country to impose curfew in the entire state with no relaxations, and only exempted essential services to prevent the infection, while Maharshtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said curfew will be imposed in the entire state from Monday midnight as the fight against coronavirus has reached a "turning point".


  Prime Minister Narendra Modi also asked state governments to ensure that rules and regulations of the coronavirus lockdown are enforced as he noted that many people are not taking the measure seriously. "Many people are still not taking the lockdown seriously. Please save yourself, save your family, follow the instructions seriously. I request state governments to ensure rules and laws are followed," he said in a tweet in Hindi. Stepping up its efforts to tackle the unprecedented situation arising out of the coronavirus breakout, the aviation ministry announced that no domestic commercial passenger flight would be allowed to operate in the country from March 25 onward. India has already banned international flights for a week from Sunday.


  Delhi, Jharkhand, and Nagaland declared a state-wide lockdown while similar curbs were announced in a number of districts in Bihar, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. Several states, including Kerala, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand, had earlier imposed a partial or complete lockdown. The UT administration in Chandigarh also announced imposition of curfew from the midnight. Those living in 80 districts across the country, including in the national capital Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai have been placed under travel and movement restrictions with authorities suspending all passenger train and inter-state bus services till March 31.


  The Centre has issued directions to state governments, asking them to take legal action against those who are found violating the lockdown orders. "States have been asked to strictly enforce the lockdown in the areas where it has been announced. Legal action will be taken against violators," tweeted the Press Information Bureau, government’s communication wing. Country’s premier medical institute in the national capital, AIIMS, decided to shut down its OPD, including speciality services, all new and follow up patients' registration, from March 24 till further order as it redirects its resources to control the Covid-19 outbreak.


  Last week, the AIIMS had issued a circular postponing all nonessential elective procedures and surgeries and directed for only emergency life-saving surgeries with effect from March 21. The virus, which originated from China's Wuhan nearly three months ago, has claimed over 15,000 lives globally and infected nearly 3.5 lakh people so far.


  The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said 18,383 samples have been tested till 10 am on Monday. Apart from nine deaths, the totally tally of 468 also included 35 people who have been cured/discharged/migrated, and 40 foreign nationals, according to the ministry data. Maharashtra has reported the highest number of COVID-19 cases at 74, including three foreigners, followed by Kerala at 67, including seven foreign nationals, according to the ministry data.


  Karnataka has 33 cases of coronavirus patients after seven more persons tested positive for the deadly virus. The number of cases in Telangana have risen to 32, including 10 foreigners. Uttar Pradesh now has 31 positive cases, including a foreign national. Delhi and Gujarat have reported 29 cases each, while Rajasthan has registered 28 positive cases, including two foreign nationals.


  In Haryana, there are 26 cases, including 14 foreigners, while Punjab has 21 cases. Ladakh has 13 cases, while Tamil Nadu has nine cases, including two foreigners. West Bengal reported seven cases, while Madhya Pradesh has six cases so far.


  Chandigarh has six cases, while Andhra Pradesh reported seven cases. Jammu and Kashmir has four cases. Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh have reported three cases each, while there are two case each in Bihar and Odisha. Puducherry and Chhattisgarh have reported a case each. Amid rising cases, the national task force for COVID-19 constituted by Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) has recommended hydroxy-chloroquine as a preventive medication for high-risk population. According to the ICMR advisory, it should be given to high risk population -- asymptomatic healthcare workers involved in the care of suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 and asymptomatic household contacts of laboratory confirmed cases.


  The protocol recommended by the National Task Force has been approved by the Drug Controller General of India (DGCI) for restricted use in emergency situations. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court directed all states and UTs to set up high-level committees to determine class of prisoners who could be released on parole, in a bid to decongest prisons to prevent the spread of coronavirus. It also said prisoners convicted of or charged with offences having jail term up to 7 years can be given parole. The court also ordered that a high-level committee should work in consultation with State Legal Service Authority for release of prisoners. Dubbing coronavirus as a "lifetime challenge", the prime minister while speaking to representatives of television news channels through a video-conference said it needed to be tackled through new and innovative solutions.


  "The tireless efforts of the reporters, camerapersons and technicians are a great service to the nation. The media should counter pessimism and panic through positive communication. COVID-19 is a lifetime challenge and it needs to be tackled through new and innovative solutions," Modi said. According to an official release, he also thanked the media for understanding the gravity of the pandemic threat and appreciated the role played by the news channels in spreading awareness.


  "A long battle lies ahead of us, whereby awareness on social distancing has to be spread and information about latest developments and key decisions needs to be communicated swiftly and professionally by the channels through an easy- to-grasp language," the prime minister said..

 Colonial Inn General Manager Andy Seidel announced on March 23 due to health and safety concerns surrounding the novel coronavirus outbreak, he has suspended restaurant operations until Monday, April 6.
 "As we see the unprecedented circumstances currently facing our country and our community, health and safety is our absolute top priority," he said in a statement. "As a result, we have altered our operations for the time being. The safety and well-being of our team members and guests is always our number one priority. In order to flatten the curve and in efforts to stop the spread of the Coronavirus, we have followed the advice and directives from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Massachusetts Department of Public Health, and other state agencies related to COVID-19."
 Seidel said the timeline may change and that his is monitoring events. He's also in constant contact with state and local officials regarding best practices.
 "We pledge to do our part to assist with the community efforts for all of our safety," he said. "Please visit our website for updates on hotel operations as well as department directories for future bookings of rooms, events and dining."
 On March 23, Gov. Charlie Baker issued a stay-at-home order for the Commonwealth, ordering all non-essential businesses to close until April 7. The order states restaurants, bars and other establishments that offer food and beverages to the public are not allowed on-premise consumption.

Sex workers from one of the worlds largest brothels appealed to the Bangladesh government on Monday for emergency funding after a ban on customers to prevent the spread of coronavirus. More than 1,500 sex workers are based at the Daulatdia brothel, about 100 km 60 miles west of Dhaka, which is one of about 12 officially sanctioned brothels in the South Asian country and receives an estimated 5,000 customers every day.The government on Friday announced the closure of the brothel - a series of shacks spread over a maze of alleyways - until at least April 5 but promised to give all of the sex workers a package of 30 kgs of rice, 25, and a freeze on rent. Government official Rubayet Hayat, executive officer of the sub-district of Goalanda, where the brothel is located, said the aid was expected to arrive late this week.But women working at Daulatdia appealed for immediate help, saying they no longer had money to pay for food for themselves or their children due to the sudden closure of the brothel. If we were informed beforehand, we could have tried to save up as much as possible. Now many of us have to take loans to not stay hungry, said Kalpona, a 30-year-old sex worker, who has been living in the brothel for nearly two decades.Right now, we need the government aid as soon as possible, she added, declining to give her full name for fear of reprisals. Sex work is legal in Bangladesh although it is considered immoral by many in the Muslim-majority nation of about 160 million people, which has so far reported three deaths from COVID-19 with at least 33 other confirmed cases.Daulatdia has been running for more than a century, set up until British colonial rule, although it moved to its current location near a ferry station in 1988 after fire destroyed the old premises. Charities say many sex workers are underage. Ataur Rahman Manju, coordinator of the rights group Mukti Mahila Samity that supports sex workers, said most sex workers live hand-to-mouth existences, with only about one in nine having the ability to save up and feed themselves.On average workers earn between 12 to 24 a day, according to Manju. The workers in high demand, about 100 or 200 of them, can probably survive for a month like this, but for the rest of the 1,500, the situation is really difficult. They immediately need food, Manju told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.Lily, 35, a sex worker, said she had not been able to send money to her 8-year-old son who lives with a family outside the brothel and she feared he was not being fed properly. While government aid was promised, Kalpona was unsure it was going to help them in the long term. Even if restrictions are lifted next month, I dont think people will come to the brothel for a long time because of the disease, she said.

VIENNA -- Specialty steelmaker Voestalpine said on Monday it would introduce shorter working hours in about 50 of its European companies in Austria, Germany, Belgium, and France as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.


  The Austrian group said demand for its products in key sectors had collapsed within days due to massive reductions in capacity and production shutdowns in the automotive, aerospace, mechanical engineering, and oil & natural gas industries.


  "The coronavirus pandemic is presenting Voestalpine with its greatest economic challenge of the past decade," said Chief Executive Herbert Eibensteiner.


  The impact on the results for the current business year 2019/2020 cannot be sufficiently determined, Voestalpine said.


  The group, which employs more than 50,000 staff globally, reported its first nine-month loss in years last month and said it would introduce short-time working for most staff at a seamless tube plant in Austria due to a fall in orders.


  "Registering for short-time work on a large scale across Europe is designed to achieve the clear objective of retaining our highly qualified employees," Eibensteiner said.


  No layoffs are planned in Austria for the time being but the numbers of contractors employed would be reduced, said the company. It did not speak about any potential layoffs elsewhere.


  Several of the company's sites in countries including France, Italy, Peru, Brazil and the United States have already been temporarily closed. (Reporting by Kirsti Knolle; Editing by Jan Harvey and Pravin Char)

AT&T and Verizon appear to have led this effort. AT&T was granted authority for 60 days to operate in DISH's AWS-4 Band spectrum. Later, both AT&T and Verizon were granted similar authority to use the FCC's AWS-3 spectrum.
 Over the last few years, Dish had bought the rights to AWS-4 for a stillborn plan to launch a 5G service. Now, Dish has donated its band for the major telecoms to use to help deal with the pandemic.
 The FCC also granted T-Mobile temporary permission to use additional 600MHz Band spectrum to help meet increased customer demand for broadband. T-Mobile delivers both 4G and its new long-distance 5G service over the 600Mhz band. US Cellular has temporary access to additional spectrum for its customers in parts of California, Oregon, Washington, and Wisconsin.
 "Consumers and businesses across the country are making the necessary adjustments to maintain social distance during the coronavirus pandemic. This means an increased reliance on wireline and wireless broadband services," said FCC Chairman Ajit Pai in a statement. "The FCC has been coordinating closely with network operators to ensure those networks remain up and running. We have been encouraged by the feedback we have received so far both regarding the ability of their networks to handle changes in usage patterns caused by the coronavirus outbreak and how networks are performing so far."

ARAPAHOE, Wyo. (AP) — Wyoming's Wind River Reservation has recorded its first known case of coronavirus but health officials doubted it was the only one. The unidentified person, whose condition wasn't disclosed, was tied to a cluster of cases among residents and staff at a Lander assisted- living center, according to Wind River Family and Community Healthcare. Wind River Family and Community Healthcare is one of two facilities on the reservation funded through the Indian Health Service, Wyoming Public Radio reports. “As we investigate this case and hear more about the other cases in the county we have good reason to believe that there are many more cases in the community,” the center's chief medical officer, Dr. Paul Ebbert, said in a Northern Arapaho Tribe statement Saturday. The Northern Arapaho share the central Wyoming reservation with the Eastern Shoshone Tribe. As of Monday, 26 people have tested positive for the virus in Wyoming. There have been 10 cases in Fremont County, where most of the reservation is located, according to the Wyoming Department of Health. The coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms for most people but can cause more severe illness for the elderly and people with existing conditions. The vast majority of those who are infected recover. The Wind River Reservation's two Indian Health Service-funded facilities were under-resourced even before the pandemic, said Wind River Family and Community Healthcare CEO Richard Brannan. Staff began preparing for COVID-19 a month before Wyoming's first case March 11, in part because they didn't expect emergency help from the federal government. \"You know, there isn't going to be a Lone Ranger riding up with a white hat and a white stallion saying 'I'm gonna save you' or whatever.

Affordable food, affordable housing, and affordable energy – the “three- legged stool” of our prosperity in this Country, and Wyoming has all three. Considering the national panic over what was just three weeks ago termed the “Wuhan Coronavirus” but has since been rebranded out of political correctness to “COVID-19,” we should be spending this time assessing not only our immediate response but looking long term at where we will be one year from now, five years from now, and in the distant future. This is not the time to panic or to talk about the history of the cold war – it is the time to figure out how Wyoming fits into the larger picture – and focusing upon the opportunities for which we seem to be especially well situated.


  We have heard much in the news about monetary packages coming out of Washington DC as we brace for the immediate, intermediate, and long-term financial fall-out from something that came to our shores without warning or welcome. This catastrophe has exposed the fact that we have exported many of our most important manufacturing capabilities to hostile countries that do not have our best interests at heart and who will propagandize throughout a disaster while blaming us for their failures. We as a country need to rethink what our future holds if we are unable to pivot away from this failing business model for the benefit of ourselves, our children, and our grandchildren. I suggest that Wyoming seek a portion of the federal money to develop and/or update a robust and accurate inventory of all warehouses, plants, and buildings that could be retrofitted for manufacturing or distribution centers in the near future. We need to focus on getting the word out that Wyoming is open for business – that we have the facilities, the infrastructure, and the skilled workforce to meet the needs of a variety of industries if they are willing to relocate here. We have the space, we have the amenities, we have the climate, and we have the people to help companies not only succeed but to thrive. All of this will help us to diversify our economy in the long run. These opportunities will be ours only if we are willing to pursue them at this moment in time.

Rio Ferdinand says Mason Greenwood’s confident attitude is a priceless asset for the Manchester United first team.

By Anastasia Moloney and Fabio Teixeira BOGOTA/RIO DE JANEIRO, March 23 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - F or decades, indigenous groups from Colombia to Brazil have been fighting the threat to their lives posed by oil exploration, deforestation and illegal logging.
 Now, the battle is against the deadly coronavirus outbreak. Indigenous tribes are locking down and closing off their reserves to visitors as they fear the disease that is fast spreading across South America could wipe them out.
 As they have little or no immunity to common outside diseases, "an epidemic can wipe out an entire tribe," warned Jonathan Mazower, communications director at London-based Survival International, an indigenous rights group. While, so far, no confirmed coronavirus cases have been reported among indigenous people in South America, Canada's Navajo Nation has at least 26 confirmed cases in parts of North America, according to the tribe's newspaper.
 Across Latin America and the Caribbean, cases of the highly contagious illness are rising daily, with more than 4,000 infected and almost 50 deaths, according to the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO). Worldwide the respiratory disease has infected more than 350,000 people and the death toll exceeds 15,000, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University.
 The message from indigenous leaders living in the Amazon rainforest and across other tribal lands is clear: stay out. In Colombia \- home to about 2 million indigenous people, according to the government - tribal leaders from the northern snow-capped mountains to the remote tropical forests of the south have issued advice to their communities.
 Visitors are not allowed to enter their self-governing reserves, and communities should implement social distancing and suspend schools and all meetings on ancestral lands. To stem the spread of coronavirus, Colombia has shut its borders, ordered a nationwide 19-day lockdown from March 24 and has closed all its national parks, many of which are home to indigenous people.
 The country's indigenous people are at particular risk due to the "misery, poverty and malnutrition that they have suffered historically", the regional indigenous organization (ORIC) in the central Casanare province said in a statement last week. LOW IMMUNITY
 Indigenous people, particularly uncontacted or recently contacted tribes, are most at risk of contracting the virus, said Mazower. Tribes that have only recently had contact with outsiders, like the Ayoreo in Paraguay who had their first contact with foreigners in the 1940s, are at risk because many already suffer from tuberculosis and other respiratory diseases, Mazower said.
 In past decades, indigenous communities have suffered fatal epidemics, including swine flu which killed at least seven Yanomami Indians in 2009, while influenza and malaria - often brought in by miners and loggers - have hit other forest tribes. "Historically we know that indigenous people have a greater biological vulnerability (to epidemics), especially to respiratory infections," said Ana Paula Vargas, Brazil program manager for Amazon Watch, an indigenous rights group.
 As some indigenous tribes only number a few dozen people or less, any deaths from the coronavirus means some communities could face outright extinction. "With the coronavirus threat, there is the possibility of really exterminating an entire people," Vargas said.
 'DIRE' SITUATION Brazil is home to about 900,000 indigenous people - less than 1% of the population - according to government figures, of which roughly a third live in cities.
 There, indigenous communities living near urban centers are bracing for the spread of coronavirus, which indigenous and health experts say threatens their livelihoods as well as their health. The country has confirmed more than 1,600 coronavirus cases.
 Lockdowns have been ordered in major states such as Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, and Brazil's borders with neighboring countries have closed. "The situation is very dire. We don't know where to find food," said David Karai Popygua, an ethnic Guarani Mbya teacher living in the small indigenous Jaragua settlement inside Sao Paulo, which saw a 37% increase in cases over the weekend, according to government data.
 As their lands are too small for foraging, the Guarani Mbya need to buy food in town and make a living selling indigenous crafts. The outbreak has seen sales of crafts plummet, while food donations from non-profits have stopped, Popygua told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
 "We need help because the majority of families have no way of feeding themselves. We're trying to help each other, but we are afraid of leaving the village and catching the virus," he said. "(The government) is not treating the community as a special case. We are over 600 people here, but we have no help."
 The head of Brazil's indigenous affairs agency (FUNAI), Marcelo Xavier, said in a video message sent to indigenous people on Friday that all preventative measures are being taken to avoid infection among indigenous people. He also said that authorizations for outsiders to enter indigenous lands have been suspended indefinitely.
 FUNAI did not reply to a request for comment. Many indigenous people receive a monthly subsidy from Brazil's government, which they depend on to survive.
 But to get the subsidy, people have to put their lives at risk as they need to leave their reserves to pick up the cash in nearby towns, said experts in indigenous affairs. ISOLATION
 In Brazil's northeastern Bahia state, home to about 35,000 indigenous people, according to Juari Braz Pataxo, a local indigenous leader, all villages that work with tourism have been closed off. "Some of the more distant (communities) are able to maintain themselves, but others depend on cities. We're advising people to leave only ... if essential," he said.
 Pataxo and other indigenous leaders are using social networks to alert distant villages, sending information about preventing the spread of coronavirus via WhatsApp in their native languages. "We released an animation that has all the necessary information," said Douglas Rodrigues, a professor of medicine at the Federal University of Sao Paulo, which has a project promoting health among indigenous communities.
 "It's the same (information) being released by the health ministry but in a way they can understand," he noted. Tribes that are more isolated, like the ones deep in the Amazon region, are more protected from infection as they are less likely to come in contact with outsiders who might be carrying the virus, said Rodrigues.
 But if anyone in those tribes does catch coronavirus, the lack of nearby healthcare and their lack of immunity could prove fatal. "If they are infected, they are screwed," said Rodrigues.

The Detroit News first reported on an email Manley sent and an FCA representative confirmed the news to Roadshow. "The fastest way we could get relief to U.S. first responders and health care workers was to use one of our operational plants," the automaker said in a statement. "So, we are quickly converting one of our China plants until the U.S. plants are back up and running."
 The representative didn't have additional details to share as to when masks will start getting into the hands of health care workers, but it's welcome news nonetheless.
 General Motors said this past Friday it would also step up and work with Ventec to rush production of life-saving ventilators. While GM didn't say it would retool any of its assembly plants to build the machines, it plans to lend its logistics, purchasing and manufacturing expertise to the company. Ford also confirmed to Roadshow previously that it's looking at ways to support ventilator production for the US and the UK.
 Tesla also appears engaged in the situation after CEO Elon Musk spoke with Medtronic about ventilator production. A Saturday report also suggested Tesla has N95 masks ready to donate and may have 1,000 ventilators ready to go as soon as next week. However, the automaker didn't return a request for comment when asked for more details. Its signature plant in Fremont, California, shut down as of March 23 to comply with a shelter-in-place order across the county, and now, California as a whole. GM, Ford and FCA also all agreed to a temporary production shutdown of all North American factories to help slow the spread of COVID-19.

In light of the national shortage of one-use personal protective equipment (PPE), Nebraska Medicine has developed a safe and effective method to decontaminate these items so they can be used multiple times, instead of just once. A team led by John Lowe, Ph.D., University of Nebraska Medical Center assistant vice chancellor for inter-professional health security training and education, is using ultraviolet light towers to irradiate high numbers of masks, which were originally designed to only be used once. The strategy will allow Nebraska Medicine to greatly extend its supply of these items during the coronavirus pandemic.      "The shortage of PPE is a nationwide issue - each and every one of these items is increasingly precious," said Mark Rupp, M.D., chief of the infectious diseases division at UNMC. "Although we were well prepared, our supplies were beginning to dwindle. We had to find a way to keep our providers and patients safe, and this will definitely help us achieve that goal."

I watched the Presidential primary debate between Sanders and Biden (a week will have passed before you are reading this), and people with disabilities didn't get lip service.


  I watch a lot of politics on television and I read it on the internet. So far, I have seen no politician courting the votes or contributions from persons with disabilities. My category, that of mentally ill people, does not have political clout. The closest we come to it is through NAMI, National Alliance on Mental Illness, an organization consisting primarily of the parents of people with mental illness. NAMI does have some amount of clout, but even they rarely get a mention by a politician.


  Mentally ill people often do not have jobs. If we had jobs, it would be easier for us to organize into an entity that has some form of clout. The money has to come from somewhere. And people are not going to contribute to the cause of mentally ill people forming an organization that is by and for mentally ill people.


  Many families continue to keep it a secret that a family member is bipolar or schizophrenic. The concept that mental illness is something to be ashamed of is a misnomer. Yet it persists.


  Many mentally ill people probably do not vote. Many can't afford to contribute to a politician. When we are living under restrictions, including the passive restraint of having no income, activities become very limited. My writing is easy to do in some respects, because it merely involves possession of a computer, and the will to sit at that computer and produce something.


  Politicians don't mention mentally ill people because that won't help them win an election. Yet there are many elected officials who care about our wellness and who will act to make our lives better after they are elected. Proposition 63 was a one percent millionaire tax to fund mental health. It has done a lot to make the lives of mentally ill people better. It pays toward the Clubhouse in Concord and might pay for some of the expenses of NAMI Contra Costa.


  In the not so distant past, mentally ill people could and did organize. This was due to there being less economic pressure and other constraints on us. Additionally, the previous generation of medications was less restrictive of brain function. Thus, in the past, mentally ill people could do more things, including organize.


  When we organized, we accomplished some good things, but there was also some amount of corruption. I was out of the loop, so I do not know the exact nature of this. However, there were some mentally ill people in the organization with which I was involved who liked being a big fish in a small pond, and they also liked fishing out of a barrel.


  Where there is money, there is corruption. At one time, mental health organizations were able to get grants. These times appear to have passed. The capacity to organize seems to have been swept away by the force of medication, and other forces, including a harsher society. The "Patients' Rights Movement" arose when there were far worse injustices in the mental health treatment system than there are now.


  Yet, in the past ten years, certain things about inpatient treatment have worsened. And, additionally, police forces have always been too heavy-handed in their detainment procedures, from what I have observed firsthand.


  Organized mentally ill people often served as a balance on the authority of the mental health treatment systems. There are some organizations, such as Office of Consumer Empowerment. Yet, my perception, and the reader should correct me if I'm wrong, is that this organization is supervised by the county.


  Better conditions for mentally ill people would allow us to organize and have clout, and not worse conditions. This is unless the parents become excessively outraged at what is being done to their adult children.


  Meanwhile, there is the Clubhouse model, which has absorbed the funding, and which is not run by recovered mentally ill people. We've lost adult status.

Unprecedented support from the U.S. Federal Reserve failed to lift global stock markets on Monday as investors continued to fret over the economic and human toll of the coronavirus pandemic. Traditional safe-havens like U.S. Treasuries and gold rose as investors fleeing riskier and higher-yielding assets looked for a place to park their money.


  The Fed's move includes new programs that will lend against student loans, credit card loans and U.S. government backed-loans to small businesses, as well others to buy bonds of larger employers and extend them loans. "While great uncertainty remains, it has become clear that our economy will face severe disruptions," the Fed said in a statement.


  Although S&P; 500 futures rose sharply after the announcement, stocks traded in the red from the opening bell, dropping almost 5% at one point. The Nasdaq was recently in positive territory. "It's their bazooka moment. It’s their 'We'll do whatever it takes' moment," said Russell Price, chief economist at Ameriprise Financial Services in Troy, Michigan.


  "But quite frankly the market is just in a waiting period right now until the virus runs its course and some of the therapies and other treatments are able to improve outcomes." Morgan Stanley analysts said on Monday they expect global growth to dip close to global financial crisis lows and U.S. growth to drop to a 74-year low in 2020. Goldman Sachs sent a similar warning.

  Globally, analysts are dreading data on weekly U.S. jobless claims due on Thursday amid forecasts they could balloon by 750,000 and possibly by more than a million. The Fed's moves put pressure on the U.S. dollar, which has risen sharply as the panic-selling drives investors toward the liquidity of the greenback and to dollar-denominated assets.


  The buying continued in U.S. Treasuries, for example, and yields fell sharply. "At the end of the day, the Fed's injections announced Monday are designed to backstop liquidity in market functioning but cannot avert the economic calamity that's already underway," said Jon Hill, U.S. rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets.


  "It really is just trying to make sure markets work and companies and municipalities can access markets when needed, but that doesn't mean layoffs aren't coming, it doesn't mean that a recession is not coming. And if you're the equity market, it's really hard to rally even on that news." Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last rose 1-29/32 in price to yield 0.7452%, from 0.938% late on Friday. The 30-year bond last rose 4-30/32 in price to yield 1.3719%, from 1.562%.


  The dollar index was little changed after falling as much as 0.84% after the Fed's announcements. The dollar fell 0.302%, with the euro up 0.69% to $1.0768.

  Investors are waiting on the U.S. government to pass stimulus to support the economy. "I think the one thing we really need to see is more fiscal ammunition coming to the fore," said Mazen Issa, senior currency strategist at TD Securities in New York. “You've got to think about those that are asked to be socially distant and stay home from work and not earn a paycheck and they're taking their time to make them whole.

It had been decades since people truly thought of the Dodgers as anything other than a California team and all the other California teams trained in Arizona. If the Dodgers wanted their fans, most of whom called California home, to see them train, it'd simply make more sense for the club to hold spring training in the desert. They'd hold their last spring training at Dodgertown in 2008. In 2009 they opened up shop at Camelback Ranch in Glendale, Arizona, sharing digs with the Chicago White Sox.

(KSLA) - Aside from a few showers tonight and later on Tuesday, this week should remain dry. There will be low rain chances and the sunshine will be returning on a few days this week. Rain chances will briefly go up Friday and Saturday as well. This evening, the scattered showers will continue. Most of the rain today has been south of I-20. Through this evening, the rain will migrate to the north. It will still be light and isolated, so it will not be a washout. Most of us will not deal with much rain at all. Temperatures will be somewhat comfortable falling to the mid 60s. Overnight, the rain will be more likely north of I-20. There will be more scattered activity as the rain continues off and on. The good news is that the rain should be gone by the morning hours. Temperatures will fall to the lower 60s. Tuesday will have a cold front push through. This will be a very weak cold front, because temperatures will actually be warmer over the next few days. The front will bring some rain to the ArkLaTex by the evening hours as it rolls on through. I think northwest Louisiana has a better shot at seeing some rain. I only have a 20% chance of rain for the day. Other places like southwest Arkansas or east Texas, may see some sunshine! Temperatures will top out in the upper 70s and lower 80s. Wednesday and Thursday will finally have no rain! It will be a couple of dry days with some sunshine. Wednesday has a better chance to have abundant sunshine, while Thursday should have a few more clouds. With the lack of rain, and the return of the sun, temperatures are expected to be quite warm. It should reach the mid to upper 80s these two days. Friday will have a small chance for a few showers in the evening. Another cold front is coming and will arrive late. So, most of the day should remain dry. The clouds will be back for sure though. I have a 20% chance of rain for the day, but again, most will arrive after sunset. Temperatures will still be quite warm and reach the mid 80s. Saturday should have some more showers, before all the rain comes to an end in the evening. I have a 30% chance of rain for the day. Therefore, I do not expect a whole lot of rain for the day. There is a chance some of us do not see much rain at all! Temperatures will be cooler though and will reach the lower to mid 70s. Sunday will go back to being dry with no rain. The clouds will likely stick around, so there should not be a lot of sunshine. Just a few peeks here and there. Still not a bad day by any means. Temperatures should top out in the lower 70s. Have a great week! Copyright 2020 KSLA. All rights reserved.

BUFFALO, N.Y. — After her sixth-grade son's school in Buffalo, New York, closed amid the coronavirus outbreak, Roxanne Ojeda-Valentin returned to campus with shopping bags to take home textbooks and weeks' worth of assignments prepared by teachers.


  A single mother with a full-time job, she now joins millions of parents around the country — and the world — suddenly thrust into the role of their children's primary educators, leaving them scrambling to sift through educational resources and juggle lesson plans with jobs and other responsibilities.


  “It’s a really big experiment,” Ojeda-Valentin said as she left the school, her second stop after picking up materials from her fourth-grade daughter's school.


  Even in school districts that are providing remote instruction, the burden falls on parents to keep their children on task. In others, parents are left to find educational websites and curricular materials on their own. And while the challenges are daunting for all, they can be nearly impossible to overcome for parents limited by access to technology and their own levels of education.


  Across the United States, more than 118,000 public and private schools in 45 states have closed, affecting 53 million students, according to a tally kept by Education Week. While many closures were initially announced as short-term, parents are wondering if schools will reopen this academic year as the outbreak intensifies.


  After Kansas became the first state to announce schools would remain closed for the year, a task force recommended from 30 minutes of work a day for the youngest students to up to three hours daily for students in sixth grade and up. California Gov. Gavin Newsom also has urged the state's more than 6 million schoolchildren and their families to make long-term plans, telling them few, if any, schools would reopen before summer.


  Los Angeles father Filiberto Gonzalez's three children have daily contact with their teachers and one to four hours of work they can do on an existing online platform that supplements classes. But he never thought the arrangement would transform from a stopgap measure to permanent situation.


  "The news ... was a real shock to a lot of us,” he said.


  In Portland, Oregon, Katie Arnold’s 7-year-old son has been spending his days in his mother’s office, keeping busy on an iPad and her laptop while she’s managing accounts for a catering company.


  Oregon has shut down schools through April 28 and some districts have put optional activities online, though they are not meant to replace the regular curriculum. While her son's district explores virtual learning, she has been combing the internet and tapping friends for suggestions.


  “Scholastic had a bunch of free things and I have a friend who’s a teacher, so I’ve gotten a lot of workbook pages for him to do, just to try to keep him busy,” said Arnold, who also has been using educational websites like ABCmouse.


  Arnold is making plans with other parents to teach children in small groups if the closure is extended, and is resigned to the idea that her workdays will be followed by evening school sessions.


  “We'll muster through it,” she said.

During a pandemic, Youdelman said, there will be a demand in services, and because Medicaid "historically underpays" for them, the providers will need more assistance to stay open. "We should be doing everything possible to keep them in business, both to help manage the pandemic and to keep people needing routine care healthy and out of overwhelmed hospitals," Youdelman said.

Wall Streets slide deepened on Monday as the rapidly spreading coronavirus forced more U.S. states into lockdown, overshadowing unprecedented moves by the U.S. Federal Reserve to shore up credit across the economy. After recently cutting interest rates to near zero, the Fed will now lend against student loans and credit card loans, as well as back the purchase of corporate bonds and make direct loans to companies.The unprecedented steps briefly lifted U.S. stock index futures before Mondays trading session began, but the mounting death toll from COVID-19 and a tide of lockdowns quickly sent the main indexes into the red, putting the SP 500 on pace for its worst month since World War Two. What the Fed did is important because it does help in the credit markets. But its not enough from an equity market perspective, said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee.What we now need is leadership out of Congress to pass some sort of stimulus bill, because what the Feds doing is relieving some problems, but it doesnt do enough to solve to solve whats out there. Investors had hoped the U.S. Senate would clear a 1 trillion-plus coronavirus stimulus package over the weekend, but Democrats and Republicans were still scrambling to come to an agreement.Maryland, Ohio, Louisiana and Delaware joined New York and California in asking people to stay home, foreshadowing a near halt in economic activity and more pain for U.S. equities and prompting several analysts to slash their growth forecasts. Goldman Sachs expects an outright contraction in global real GDP in 2020 on the back of a 24 plunge in U.S. real GDP in the second quarter two-and-a-half times as large as the previous post- war record.The Feds stimulus measures failed to reassure investors jolted by a 9 trillion wipeout in the benchmark SP 500s value since a record high hit last month. A rush for safe-haven assets like government bonds caused U.S. Treasury yields to fall on Monday. The SP 500 was on track to close down 34 from its February record high, its lowest level since fears of the coronavirus swept across Wall Street.What we really need to turn things around is a sense of closure - not on the virus, but on the response to the virus, said Stephen Massocca, Senior Vice President at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. Once the market sees that, I think the market will rebound considerably. At 232 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 3.03 at 18,592.71 points, while the SP 500 had tumbled 2.88 to 2,238.61.The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.76 to 6,827.12, its overall decline cushioned by a 2.2 rise in Amazon.com. The SP energy index slumped 6.3, the most among the 11 major sectors, tracking a plunge in oil prices.The SP consumer discretionary index rose 0.3, the only sector index in positive territory. Leading the Dow, Boeing surged 11.6 after Goldman Sachs upgraded its rating on the planemaker to buy.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.10-to-1 ratio on Nasdaq, a 1.75-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The SP 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 208 new lows the Nasdaq Composite recorded 2 new highs and 483 new lows.

Unprecedented support from the U.S. Federal Reserve failed to lift global stock markets on Monday as investors continued to fret over the economic and human toll of the coronavirus pandemic. Traditional safe-havens like U.S. Treasuries and gold rose as investors fleeing riskier and higher- yielding assets looked for a place to park their money.The Feds move includes new programs that will lend against student loans, credit card loans and U.S. government backed-loans to small businesses, as well others to buy bonds of larger employers and extend them loans. While great uncertainty remains, it has become clear that our economy will face severe disruptions, the Fed said in a statement.Although SP 500 futures rose sharply after the announcement, stocks traded in the red from the opening bell, dropping almost 5 at one point. The Nasdaq was recently in positive territory. Its their bazooka moment. Its their Well do whatever it takes moment, said Russell Price, chief economist at Ameriprise Financial Services in Troy, Michigan.But quite frankly the market is just in a waiting period right now until the virus runs its course and some of the therapies and other treatments are able to improve outcomes.

The All India Council for Technical Education extended the deadline for approval process by a week on Sunday.


  The annual exercise to arrive at increase / decrease in the number is a precursor to the start of admission process for colleges under the council.


  A week ago, Anna University issued an advisory to shut down colleges in view of COVID-19 infection for a fortnight. The university had informed colleges that it would provide an additional two weeks to complete the syllabus before announcing the dates for exams.


  Several professors said the extension for the semester would not be sufficient to complete the subjects. K. Manivannan, chief executive officer, Mohammed Sathak Group of Institutions, said the first year students were the most affected as their semester began late.


  Final year students who had applied for higher studies abroad would also be affected as the admission process for fall semester begins in March-April.


  Several colleges have taken to online teaching and learning process to prepare the students. P.S. Srinivasan, principal, Knowledge Institute of Technology, Salem, said the students have been given a timetable to keep them engaged.


  The institution has almost completed the course work for second, third and final year students who have been provided a set of question papers to solve and send to the teachers either by e-mail or social media options, he said. D. Saravanan, dean, academics, Kumaraguru College of Technology, said students had been provided the unfinished portion as online material. “It cannot be a replacement for a regular class but only supplement it,” he said.


  The director of a college in Chennai said: “We have encouraged faculty to provide classes online. We have asked for a system to place accountability for the faculty so that we will know what the students have done. This system will go on till March 31. We are trying to provide online exams for the students.”

New Delhi, Mar 23 (PTI) A total of 30 states and Union Territories have imposed complete lockdown, covering a total of 548 districts in the country, to check the spread of coronavirus, the government said on Monday.


  Six other states have put in place similar restrictions in some areas in the wake of the outbreak.


  There are 28 states, eight UTs and in the country.


  On Sunday, 80 districts were under lockdown.


  The central government has also asked states to enforce additional restrictions, if necessary, leading to imposition of curfew in Punjab and Maharashtra.


  As many people continued to venture out despite the lockdown order, Puducherry, besides Punjab and Maharashtra, also ordered curfew so that no one goes out of home.


  A tweet by the Press Information Bureau said the states which have imposed lockdown in all districts include Chandigarh, Delhi, Goa, Jammu and Kashmir and Nagaland.


  The other states are: Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, West Bengal, Ladakh, Tripura, Telangana, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Meghalaya, Jharkhand, Bihar, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Haryana, Daman Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Karnataka and Assam.


  Prime Minister Narendra Modi has appealed to state governments to ensure that rules and regulations of the coronavirus lockdown are enforced strictly as he noted that many people were not following the measures seriously.


  "Many people are still not taking the lockdown seriously. Please save yourself, save your family, follow the instructions seriously. I request state governments to ensure rules and laws are followed," Modi said in a tweet in Hindi.


  The death toll due to the novel coronavirus pandemic rose to nine on Monday after West Bengal and Himachal Pradesh reported a casualty each, while the number of confirmed cases soared to 468, the Union Health Ministry said.


  The central and state governments had on Sunday announced lockdown in about 80 districts where at least one confirmed case of Covid-19 was reported.


  Meanwhile, Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba wrote a letter to State Chief Secretaries urging them to monitor the situation round the clock.


  Gauba said additional restrictions if necessary may be imposed and all current restrictions must be enforced strongly.


  All violations should be met with legal action, the Cabinet Secretary told the states and UTs.

If you’re hungry, you might notice an empty feeling in your belly. What we are looking for is direct experience, which takes us away from the thoughts that might bother us, even though they still arise.”
 In light of the coronavirus pandemic, we might get trapped in recursive patterns of negative thoughts as we go about our day, catastrophising about what might happen to us and our loved ones.
 “When we experience anxiety, we are anticipating something that hasn’t happened, and in meditation we can see the fruitlessness of that,” Vajragupta adds. “These anxieties might involve not being able to get food, being on your own, dying alone. Meditation can give us some perspective on this.
 “We think that we can control our lives. And in a crisis, we find that we cannot control our lives half as much as we think. So even something like running out of toilet paper, for example, can create panic and make us very self-absorbed.
 “Practicing meditations like loving-kindness, where we wish others well and pray that they are free from suffering, takes us away from our own self- absorption. When we bring to mind that everybody is in the same position, we can start thinking more creatively about what we can do when we can’t get hold of toilet paper.
 “If we can relax into meditation, we realise we are a tiny part of something much bigger. The reality is that there is a lot of neighbourhood goodwill and that if people ask for help there is plenty available. We have a list of Buddhist volunteers that are waiting to help anyone in need.”
 While Norwich Buddhist Centre is closed to the public due to the coronavirus, Vajragupta explains they are transferring operations online and continue to support the community.
 “We are uploading daily videos of approximately 10 minutes offering people advice and guidance and are continuing to transfer as much of our programme onto our website as possible.
 “If anybody would like a helpful book on meditation, ring Norwich Buddhist Centre to order one and we will send it to you.”

Islamabad [Pakistan], Mar 23 (ANI): As several countries across the world including China, India and South Korea have gone under lockdowns to stall the spread of the coronavirus, imposing lockdown in Pakistan amid the crisis would cause "untold misery" to the multitudes that survive on daily wages or those with small businesses dependent on a steady income to make ends meet."Rapid transmission of COVID-19 has been checked in China and South Korea through lockdowns. Such a drastic step, given the realities of Pakistan, would cause untold misery to the multitudes that survive on daily wages or those with small businesses dependent on a steady income to make ends meet," according to an editorial by Dawn.As cases in Pakistan continue to rise, experts are suggesting the government to impose a complete lockdown. The country has so far reported 873 confirmed cases of the deadly virus and six deaths. However, Prime Minister Imran Khan said that state-imposed curfew is not possible in the country as one-fourth of its population is under the poverty line and survives on daily wages."A complete lockdown means imposing a curfew administered by state and army, forcing people to stay indoors. Our country's 25 per cent population lives below the poverty line and survives on daily wages. We are taking steps, keeping our on-ground status in mind," Pakistan Prime Minister's Office wrote on Twitter."However, there may come a point when the government decides it has no choice but to impose such a lockdown at least in some parts of the country. In any case, the closure of markets and schools -- places where hawkers tend to find customers -- has already begun to impact the poor. An intervention by the state is urgently required," the editorial said."In concert with provincial dispensations, the government must devise a streamlined plan of action that also co-opts the private sector -- including organisations already engaged in charitable work -- so that efforts are not replicated and equitable distribution of relief goods is ensured. Low-income families must be provided the wherewithal to make it through this unfolding nightmare," it added.Sindh province reported 42 new coronavirus cases on Monday -- three in Karachi and 39 in Sukkur. The provincial tally is now 394.There is a discrepancy between the numbers of confirmed cases released by the Control and Command Centre set up to deal with the crisis and those given by provincial governments, which are possibly more up to date.The Pakistan daily, in its editorial, said that Sindh has shown itself to be commendably responsive to the multi-faceted challenge posed by COVID-19. However, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) has begun rolling out a coherent strategy.While Sindh has shown itself to be commendably responsive to the multi-faceted challenge posed by COVID-19, and KP has begun rolling out a coherent strategy. The total number of COVID-19 cases in Punjab has now gone up to 246.Meanwhile, Pakistan- occupied Kashmir (PoK) so-called 'Prime Minister' Raja Farooq Haider announced that a complete lockdown will be imposed in the region for three weeks starting midnight on Monday."This is no time for politics or platitudes. It is a moment that calls for our leadership to rise above their differences and formulate a coordinated response that can make efficient and judicious use of available resources," the Dawn editorial stated.

ROANOKE, Va. (AP) — Domestic violence counselors in Virginia say they are are preparing for a possible increase in cases as people spend more time at home during quarantines prompted by the coronavirus outbreak. The Roanoke Times reports that groups such as Total Action for Progress are concerned. Stacey Sheppard, TAP’s director of human services, said the nonprofit's crisis intervention staffers have seen before the effect of major snowstorms and other events that keep people shut in together and add strain to an already stressful situation. “These are increasingly stressful times already,” Sheppard said. “So we’ve been preparing and planning, talking through what ifs and how we can handle an increase in volume.” Advocates say they want people to know that services are still up and running. “We’re still actively taking clients,” said Capt. Jamie Clay, residential director with the domestic violence shelter offered by the Salvation Army of Roanoke. The Salvation Army now checks the temperature of all who come into its shelter and has made adjustments to allow for more distance between people as recommended by health officials. SARA Roanoke, a sexual assault crisis center, has shifted its counseling clients to tele-appointments to observe social distancing and allow its staffers to work from home as much as possible. The center still mans its round-the-clock emergency hotline, said Executive Director Teresa Berry. “We’re working to maintain as much as we can while at the same time keeping everybody safe,\" Berry said.

Despite this setback, Alexandria is ready to hit the ground running once it gets the go-ahead. With practices being canceled for the foreseeable future, Closser knows his players are doing what they can to take on this season in full force.


  “Usually, we have two-and-a-half weeks before we start playing,” Closser said. “Now we are not going to have time to do all that. This group is very dedicated … and they have tunnel vision right now. I can almost guarantee that they are out getting it done … to stay in some kind of baseball shape.”


  When there are seven seniors on a team, even the thought of canceling the season can be heartbreaking. The Tigers are feeling the heat as they are uncertain about the future.


  “This is tough, especially on our seniors,” Closser said. “I know it’s really tough on them, but it is tough on everybody. I’m sure their feelings are mixed. Three or four of them are going on to college to play baseball, but it’s not the same as being with your buddies in high school trying to win back-to-back state titles.”

REPURPOSED: General Motors is exploring the production of ventilators at a facility in Kokomo, Indiana. The automaker said Monday that it’s working around the clock with Ventec Life Systems of Washington State to build more of the critical medical devices. GM says that with its manufacturing and supply chain expertise, Ventec is planning “exponentially higher” ventilator production as soon as possible. GM spokesman Dan Flores said he can’t comment on how many more ventilators Ventec will make or how soon they will come. The GM statement also didn’t say when the Kokomo facility might be in operation. Supply chain experts say it will be difficult to repurpose an auto plant to build a smaller, unrelated product such as ventilators. They say such a change could take months, but GM may be doing it faster.

Given the experience and maturity of the team, the Tigers are well-equipped to handle whatever these unprecedented times call for. This is one key that may work out in Alexandria’s favor if the regular season is drastically cut.


  “With what we have coming back, it helps our chances (of winning a state title) a lot,” Closser said. “We have a lot of senior leadership. These guys are relentless at getting the work in. I don’t think it will take us as long as some younger teams to get into the flow.”


  Of the senior class in 2020, Rylan Metz sticks out as a dynamic athlete who has gone through the Alexandria athletic system for a while. Metz will be continuing his athletic and academic career at Anderson University in the fall. Closser said his best is yet to come.


  “He’s the type of kid that has untapped potential,” Closser said. “He does well in everything he does. When he starts playing just one sport at AU, he is just going to explode. He has all kinds of ability that people haven’t seen yet.”


  The seniors for the Tigers include Metz, Alex Patton, Cade Vernetti, Brennan Morehead, Bub Misner, Brayton Gaines and Nick Williams


  Helping a very strong senior class is junior Kole Stewart, who is expected to find his groove at both second base and shortstop. Also complimenting this core of talent is junior Brendan Luzader behind the plate. Luzader stepped up because of injury last season and was able to catch the state championship game.


  Only time will tell if spring sports will commence, but if they do, Alexandria is ready to defend its crown.

EASTON — The U.S. Small Business Administration Administrator Jovita Carranza announced changes to help borrowers still paying back SBA loans from previous disasters.


  By making this change, deferments through Dec. 31, 2020, are now automatic. The changes mean borrowers of home and business disaster loans do not have to contact SBA to request deferment, according to a Monday, March 23, SBA press release.


  "The SBA is looking at every option and taking every action to cut red tape to make it easier for small businesses to stay in business. Automatically deferring existing SBA disaster loans through the end of the year will help borrowers during this unprecedented time," Carranza said.


  "These actions include making it easier for states and territories to request a declaration so small businesses statewide can now apply for economic injury disaster loans," added SBA Mid-Atlantic Regional Administrator Steve Bulger, who oversees the agency's operations in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, Delaware, Maryland and the District of Columbia. "This is another way the SBA is working around the clock to find ways to assist small businesses."


  All Maryland small businesses can now apply for the SBA disaster assistance following the declaration on Friday, March 20, which approved all Maryland counties as disaster relief eligible areas.


  Eligibility is based on the financial impact of the COVID-19. The interest rate is 3.75% for small businesses, and 2.75% for private non-profit organizations. SBA offers loans with long-term repayments in order to keep payments affordable, up to a maximum of 30 years and are available to entities without the financial ability to offset the adverse impact without hardship, a SBA press release on Friday, March 20 stated.

For the time being, the Gulf’s third super-connector airline, Qatar Airways, is still able to maintain its business model of connecting passengers over its hub at Doha’s Hamad International Airport. The Qatar government has closed its borders for foreigners, allowing only Qatari nationals entry to the state of Qatar; however passengers from all destinations served by Qatar Airways can still travel with the airline and transit through, subject to entry restrictions at their final destination.

It’s not ideal, said Lovato, whose “preference is always to be in a physical community at the studio with people practicing.” What’s more, she said, “it’s been a hustle for me to figure out this technology” to deliver the virtual classes, which people can pay to access live or in the archive. But, she said, it’s “what we have to work with,” and “right now is a time where we really need our practice.”


  Reformatting service is one way to carry on with business in light of both U.S. President Donald Trump and Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon’s warnings to limit social gatherings and stay home.


  “It feels really weird,” Lovato said about what it’s like speaking into a headset, projecting her voice out through a Wi-Fi signal. “As a teacher, I don’t generally do the practice. I watch the bodies in the room and cue based on what I’m seeing. I don’t typically plan my classes either – I wait to read the room. I can’t do either of those things without them in there.”


  Initially, people have responded well to consuming their daily yoga instruction through video.


  “We had more people join us than would have fit in the studio,” Lovato said about the 45 people who registered for one of the classes. “So far, it’s going better than expected.”


  Even a few of her college friends who live out of state have signed up because “now they can.”


  Lovato said she’ll continue teaching yoga online for as long as needed, and is already prophesying that “this is going to change things permanently” for her business.


  Blossom Yoga is offering daily yoga classes online. Starting next week, it will offer a yoga course for children, as well as a weekly meditation class. To learn more and sign up for classes, visit http://cheyenne.blossomyogastudio.com/index.php.


  About two weeks ago, before there were any confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Wyoming, Joseph Forscher was already helping make significant changes to best serve his company’s clients.


  Forscher is the chief clinical officer at Peak Wellness Center, which offers treatment and care for those living with addiction, depression and other mental health difficulties. A worldwide pandemic is an unsettling time for everyone, let alone those with other health issues, so he and the rest of the center leadership team formed a task force to determine the best plan of action.


  “Our immediate task was to figure out how to stay relevant and safe for our clients, so the first thing I did was reach out to clinic directors – we have four, one in each of four counties – and asked them to start putting together lists of clients most at risk,” Forscher said. “(We) had case managers start reaching out to them and put together a script for that, checking in and making sure they are all set for their basic needs, food, medication, etc., and that quickly expanded to calling all our clients across the agency.”


  The issue that soon emerged, Forscher said, was the increased danger of community spread via in-person therapy services. The task force decided to start taking the temperatures of people still coming in as a precautionary screening process, but that wasn’t helpful to those who didn’t feel comfortable leaving their homes.


  So, the task force decided it would be best to expand telehealth services to provide uninterrupted care for clients in its several coverage areas. The first step in doing so, Forscher said, was taking inventory of the laptops every center had on hand. The company’s IT department also sent out requirements for clinicians’ home laptops, and if they met those requirements, they were allowed to deliver online therapy sessions from their respective homes via individual Zoom licenses quickly obtained for every clinician.


  “I think the biggest change for us is in our mindset,” Forscher said. “Although we’ve been delivering telehealth services for years, it’s been almost exclusively with our medication providers, psychiatrists and nurse practitioners, so to expand that concept to delivering teletherapy was a big change for us. But once we started to do it and got past some of the initial challenges with the technology piece, I’ve been very surprised and very proud of the team. It’s seamless at this point, and we’ve only been doing it for less than two weeks.”


  Offering sessions online is quite different than an in-person interaction, Forscher admitted, so the company led briefings to present clinicians with a checklist of how to start these unique conversations. They also were taught how to help their clients be more comfortable with the new scenario – one that Forscher hopes won’t be necessary for much longer, but he also plans to make available to clients after the pandemic as another option.


  “If our clients don’t feel comfortable, the treatment we provide will be less meaningful,” he said. “We’ve (always) been in the business of giving basic needs and giving people what they need to feel safe … but every day is a new challenge, and every day when I meet that challenge, it feels good.”


  At first glance, it’s business as usual at Western Vista Federal Credit Union in Cheyenne.


  Outside the building, customers are still rolling through the drive-thru, depositing checks. Bank tellers are still sitting behind the windows, ready to process the money.


  Inside the building, loan officers are still taking appointments. But there are subtle signs that the deadly COVID-19 virus has changed working conditions at the credit union.


  More cleaning supplies. Fewer staff. Building entry by appointment only.


  Bank tellers use a cleaning wipe to sanitize the plastic tubes each time a customer uses it to deposit currency at the drive-thru, the only space the general public can interact with staff.


  “We have people come in and out of our branch every day for transactions that could be done through the drive-thru,” said Lorrell Walter, senior vice president of marketing for the credit union. “Now we’re mandating it.”


  The credit union has also split its in-office staffing into shifts.


  It’s allowing employees to work from home every other week to thin the number of people in the office at one time, which could prevent the spread of the virus.


  “Our staff is our greatest resource. Which is why we’re doing our best to alternate folks in and out of the office,” said Walter, who’s assured staff that regardless, they will continue to receive their full paychecks. “We don’t want to put someone like a teller – who can’t do their job from home – in a bad situation because of a decision we’ve made for the safety of our staff and customers.”


  That’s one of the reasons why Evann McCarrick, who is a new bank teller at the branch, is glad she’s no longer working full-time at Olive Garden, which recently announced it would be offering only curbside food pickup during the pandemic.


  “If I was trying to serve tables and make enough money to pay my bills on my own it would be really stressful,” McCarrick said.


  But not everyone has that kind of reassurance.


  “A lot of my friends who work in the mall, for the time being a lot of them have restricted hours,” McCarrick said. “I worry about them.”

New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo on Monday said there is a need to ensure economic viability and pivot to a more functional economy, saying he is looking into whether young people and those immune to the virus can resume work sooner. His statement came as the total number of deaths due to coronavirus crossed 15,000 globally. Over 341,300 cases have been registered in 174 countries and territories since the epidemic first emerged in China in December.There has to be a balance or parallel tracks that were going down. Were talking about public health, were talking about isolation, were talking about protecting lives. There also has to be a parallel track that talks about economic viability, Cuomo said at a press conference. I take total responsibility for shutting off the economy in terms of essential workers. But we also have to start to plan the pivot back to economic functionality. You cant stop the economy forever, he said.Cuomo added that there is a need to think about whether everyone stays out of work and for how long. Should young people go back to work sooner. Can we test for those who had the virus, resolve and are now immune. And can they start to go back to work, he said, referring to a theory of risk stratification, which states that it is important to isolate the vulnerable people and not isolate everyone.And if you isolate all people, you may be actually exposing the more vulnerable people by bringing in a person who is healthier and stronger and who may have been exposed to the virus... Can you get to a point where the healthy people who are most likely not going to be affected can go to work, the Governor said. He underscored that studying the numbers across the countries of people that have been infected, it has been established that the survival rate for those who have been infected is 98 per cent.A lot of people get it. Very few people die from it. So how do we start to calculate that, he said. Cuomo has implemented the New York State on PAUSE executive order, a 10-point policy to assure safety for everyone.It includes a new directive that all non-essential businesses statewide must close in-office personnel functions effective at 8 PM on Sunday and temporarily bans all non-essential gatherings of individuals of any size for any reason. When in public, individuals must practice social distancing of at least six feet from others and young people should also practice social distancing and avoid contact with vulnerable populations.He said the state has implemented New York Pause and we have to start to think about New York forward that will require thinking about how to restart or transition to a restart of the economy. And how do you dovetail that with a public health strategy. As youre identifying people who have had the virus, and have resolved, can they start to go back to work. Can younger people start to go back to work because theyre much more tolerant to the effect of the virus. You turned off the engine quickly. How do you now start or begin to restart or plan the restart of that economic engine, he said.Cuomo said New York has tested 78,000 cases and as on Sunday, about 25 per cent of all the testing nationwide is being produced in New York. New York state has about 20,000 positive cases state-wide. Currently 13 per cent of the cases are hospitalised and of this, 24 per cent require ICU and ventilator facilities.

The lack of revenue is hitting many involved in the concert industry, from crew and bartenders to the musicians themselves. Drummer Evan Knisely of local rock act Wyves says they're already feeling the pinch.
 "This month is shaping up to be awfully scary on everyone's wallets. Most of our band make ends meet by gigging, and everything is getting cleared," Knisely says. "This is the month to build up a nest egg for droughts throughout the rest of the year, and it is getting tanked."

Ted Koppel, a highly respected journalist with a long track record, aired a set of interviews on yesterday’s episode of Sunday Morning. His reporting highlighted the emerging likelihood of physicians being forced to ration healthcare services to severely ill patients suffering from the effects of COVID-19. His questioning began as an exploration of how an ER doctor with only one ventilator at hand would choose which of two patients who needed it would get it. The physician provided a medically reasonable, nuanced response, noting that this type of occurrence would be rare as most patients recover from the illness. In the unlikely event that limited resources would force such a choice, she noted that underlying health conditions would be considered, other treatments would be evaluated and so forth. At the end of the day after much pressing and suggesting that the physician was evading the question, Mr. Koppel got what he seemed to be driving towards — that number of life years is a factor that is taken into account, all things being equal. Hard choices may be made in the face of scarce resources.
