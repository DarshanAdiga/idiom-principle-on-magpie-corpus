As you saw, not just the nursery, but Katy also showed some of the baby outfits, and they are just super cute. There is sweet cherry printed onesie inspired by her first hit single, _I Kissed A Girl_. And then there is another outfit that has Katy's fiance Orlando's face printed all over it. We absolutely love the Eggo Waffle dress. There is a story there as Katy was craving Eggos during most of her pregnancy. Well, Katy and Orlando's baby girl is going to be a very stylish baby, clearly.

What were you doing at 13 years of age? Playing with friends or riding your bike? I bet you weren’t starting a successful digital marketing company.

It’s hard to believe that this successful multi-national marketing agency that all started with a 13-year-old boy has grown the level of popularity that it has. Chase has now trained and employed a small team to help him with growing demand.

Katy Perry is soon going to welcome a baby girl into this world with fiancé Orlando Bloom, and needless to say, they both are very excited for their little angel's arrival. They are also fully prepared, it seems. After all, the singer recently gave a sneak peek into her baby's nursery on her Smile Sunday show. We just can't get over the interiors of the room. “Hey everyone, I’m going to show you my baby room — just a little sneak peek,” Katy is seen gushing as she admits that she has not shown it to anyone else. The nursery is painted in a tone of blush, and includes all the right pieces, which includes a crib, a reclining chair along with a diaper changing station.

The first challenge Chase faced when setting up Chillspot was the absence of a website. Multiple social media profiles were directing potential clients to Chillspot’s Instagram page, but without a website, it was hard to secure new clients. Determination and hard work lead to Chillspot’s first client and with the money made from that client Chase were able to set up his first website.
