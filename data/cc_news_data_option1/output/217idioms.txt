RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Brazil's government has drawn criticism after launching a project that aims to revamp the country's arts scene, with a focus on nationalism and religion. The project is part of the far-right administration's answer to what it sees as decades of leftist hegemony in the cultural sphere — from art to education and family. Though cash-strapped, the government of President Jair Bolsonaro will spend $4.9 million to foment the production of literature, theater, opera, music and other arts. It was announced by Bolsonaro, Education Minister Abraham Weintraub and culture secretary Roberto Alvim from a library of the official presidential residence in a live Facebook video. Alvim, the driving force behind the initiative, is a born-again Christian who found renewed faith while recovering from cancer. He delivered a separate message about the initiative using a phrase local paper O Globo compared to a speech by Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels; Alvim said on Facebook on Wednesday that it was merely a “rhetorical coincidence.”The president of Brazil's lower house said on Twitter the video went beyond the pale, and that Bolsonaro should remove Alvim from his position immediately. While the amount to be spent is a drop in the bucket compared to other arts funding, the project jibes with the government's other efforts to overturn what Bolsonaro calls “cultural Marxism” and some of his ministers say is undermining society’s morals. The leftist Workers' Party governed Brazil for 13 years until 2016. “When culture becomes sick, the people become sick, too,” Alvim said in the video beside Bolsonaro. “Brazilian culture was deliberately sickened during the recent decades. Culture is the basis of the homeland.” More than 57 million people — 55% of the voters in 2018's election -- embraced...

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — A Philadelphia teenager has been charged with the slayings of his foster mother and a man who authorities say were both “brutally tortured and murdered.\" The 17-year-old boy was charged with murder in the stabbing death of Renee Gilyard, 64, and in the death of Jimmy Mao, 20, whose remains were found in a duffel bag. Robbery appears to be the motive in both cases, authorities said. Gilyard had been the teen's foster mother for three days, She was found in a bathtub inside her Philadelphia home shortly after 1 a.m. Wednesday. Family members who had gone there to check on Gilyard found her with multiple stab and defensive wounds. Gilyard's SUV was later recovered by police after it crashed into a truck and caught fire in Philadelphia. The teen and three other juveniles were found in the SUV. Mao was last seen Dec. 29. and his remains were found Wednesday night in a back alley. It's not clear when he was killed, but authorities said he had blunt force trauma to the face and neck. The teen had previously been placed in the same foster home as Mao, authorities said. During the time Mao was missing, authorities said his family received ransom texts, though further details were not disclosed. The teen faces numerous counts, including murder, theft, tampering with evidence and fleeing or eluding. It's not known if he's retained an attorney,

LAURINBURG, N.C. (AP) — A bus driver in North Carolina was transporting kids to school when her ex-boyfriend boarded the vehicle and began beating the woman, who managed to keep her foot on the brake even after being knocked to the floor, police said. The Scotland County Schools driver had stopped to pick up students along her morning route Tuesday in Laurinburg when 46-year-old Kenneth Latrel Revels boarded unexpectedly, the Laurinburg Police Department said in a statement. Revels is accused of punching her repeatedly and stomping her head after knocking her to the floor. As many as 20 children were on board, watching while she struggled to keep her foot on the brake to prevent the bus from “moving uncontrollably.” Revels eventually hopped out of the bus and ran away. He hasn't been caught, news outlets reported. The district said no students on the bus were injured. Revels is wanted on charges of violating a domestic violence protection order, assault on a female, assault on a school employee, disorderly conduct on a school bus, entering a school bus unlawfully, breaking or entering a motor vehicle, assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill and assault with a deadly weapon in the presence of minors. Police said Revels used his hands and feet as potentially deadly weapons. Laurinburg is about 80 miles (129 kilometers) southeast of Charlotte.

 Kimmi, a black labrador, had just enjoyed a long walk near Highcliffe when she began convulsing.
 It is believed she ingested the tuber roots of the potentially-deadly water hemlock, also known as Cicuta.
 Her owner Sarah Hammett said Kimmi survived thanks to a Good Samaritan who drove them to a vet where she was immediately anaesthetised and treated.
 Mrs Hammett said Kimmi had been "galloping around the beach" from Barton-on- Sea to Mudeford on Wednesday when she began playing with some tubers, which resembled Iris roots.

It is with great sadness that the family of Joseph Joe Francis Donio announce his passing on Saturday, January 11, 2020 at the age of 69 years at St. Joseph's Hospice with family by his side.      Joe was born in MacDiarmid, ON on March 11, 1950 where he was raised before moving in 1968, to Toronto where he met the love of his life, Karen. Upon returning to the north, Joe and his wife Karen started their family settling in Jellicoe and then later on to Geraldton in the mid-1970's. Joe was employed with the Canadian National Railway starting as a Section Man and moving his way up to Section Foreman. He later changed employment and worked in the Forest sector starting with Domtar and Abitibi and then later with Kimberly- Clark for 32 years. During this time, Joe started as a cutter and eventually became a truck driver where he hauled pulpwood to the Terrace Bay mill.      Due to his health, Joe went into early retirement as he was no longer able to continue his work in the bush. He then began to help his wife in their family business, Jo-Anne's Flower Boutique in Geraldton. Joe spent many hours working in all parts of the shop, but his favorite activity was delivering flowers to the people in the region. Joe was a very social fellow and he very much enjoyed the conversations he had with the shop's customers and recipients.      Joe's greatest passion was to be outdoors. He loved hunting and fishing and often out fished everyone who went with him. Joe also enjoyed endless hours at his camp at Wildgoose Lake with family and friends. He enjoyed many outdoor activities including Atving, snowmobiling and trapping.      Joe was a strong and independent man and a jack of all trades. He had a great sense of humour often joking with people. He was predeceased by his parents Maurice (Morris) and Amelia Donio (nee McGuire) and siblings Robert and Agnes Marie (Nee nee).      Joe will be forever missed by his wife Karen and sons Joe (Angela), Michael and grandchildren Matthew, Issac and Lucas all of Thunder Bay. He is also survived by his sister Annabelle and brother Patrick, both of Thunder Bay as well as many nieces and nephews.      Family and friends are invited to visit at St. Theresa R.C. Church on Saturday, January 18th from 12noon until the time of the Funeral Mass, officiated by Fr. Gerard Legaspi, at 1pm. Following the services, a reception will be held at the Parish Hall.

It is already known that Dreams, a first-party PS4 exclusive releasing on the 14th of February, could come to PC someday, due to its developer Media Molecule publicly stating the desire for this to occur. Furthermore, it was recently announced that MLB: The Show, also a first-party developed exclusive, would be coming to other consoles from 2021 onwards.

 It is with great sadness that the family of Joseph Joe Francis Donio announce his passing on Saturday, January 11, 2020 at the age of 69 years at St. Joseph's Hospice with family by his side. Joe was born in MacDiarmid, ON on March 11, 1950 where he was raised before moving in 1968, to Toronto where he met the love of his life, Karen. Upon returning to the north, Joe and his wife Karen started their family settling in Jellicoe and then later on to Geraldton in the mid-1970's. Joe was employed with the Canadian National Railway starting as a Section Man and moving his way up to Section Foreman. He later changed employment and worked in the Forest sector starting with Domtar and Abitibi and then later with Kimberly-Clark for 32 years. During this time, Joe started as a cutter and eventually became a truck driver where he hauled pulpwood to the Terrace Bay mill. Due to his health, Joe went into early retirement as he was no longer able to continue his work in the bush. He then began to help his wife in their family business, Jo-Anne's Flower Boutique in Geraldton. Joe spent many hours working in all parts of the shop, but his favorite activity was delivering flowers to the people in the region. Joe was a very social fellow and he very much enjoyed the conversations he had with the shop's customers and recipients. Joe's greatest passion was to be outdoors. He loved hunting and fishing and often out fished everyone who went with him. Joe also enjoyed endless hours at his camp at Wildgoose Lake with family and friends. He enjoyed many outdoor activities including Atving, snowmobiling and trapping. Joe was a strong and independent man and a jack of all trades. He had a great sense of humour often joking with people. He was predeceased by his parents Maurice (Morris) and Amelia Donio (nee McGuire) and siblings Robert and Agnes Marie (Nee nee). Joe will be forever missed by his wife Karen and sons Joe (Angela), Michael and grandchildren Matthew, Issac and Lucas all of Thunder Bay. He is also survived by his sister Annabelle and brother Patrick, both of Thunder Bay as well as many nieces and nephews. Family and friends are invited to visit at St. Theresa R.C. Church on Saturday, January 18th from 12noon until the time of the Funeral Mass, officiated by Fr. Gerard Legaspi, at 1pm. Following the services, a reception will be held at the Parish Hall. In the memory of Joe Donio, donations to Our Hearts at Home Cardiovascular Campaign ( www.healthsciencesfoundation.ca/donatenow ) or a charity of your choice would be greatly appreciated. Online condolences may be made through Fawcett Funeral Home at www.rfffh.com

The “pessimism” of Ta-Nehisi Coates is a repeated, irresistible target. And Williams is always willing to revise our view of Black Lives Matter. But if _Losing My Cool_ had dreamed aloud about a splendid new attitude for black people, his new book— _Self-Portrait in Black and White: Unlearning Race_ , also a memoir—proclaims, with intriguing relief, that the thing we call “black America” does not, in fact, exist.

“The No. 1 threat to my district is Donald Trump. The No. 1 threat to Martin Luther King’s legacy is Donald Trump,” Sewell said of the Republican president. “The best way I can counter that threat is to support someone who can beat him.”
 Biden, she continued, “has a proven track record of furthering what Dr. King fought for” and can “protect that legacy” because he can appeal across the racial and ideological spectrum.
 “Joe has a special combination of vast experience, respectability and authenticity that is well-received by Republicans and Democrats and globally by our allies and foes,” the fifth-term congresswoman said. Quoting her mother, she added, “Joe can talk to anyone.”
 Sewell will campaign this weekend with Biden in South Carolina, which hosts the South's first presidential primary on Feb. 29.
 Biden now has virtually swept the most coveted endorsements among Alabama Democrats. Sen. Doug Jones is among his earliest supporters, and he recently picked up the endorsement of Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin, a coup for Biden given the 38-year-old mayor’s relationship with 2020 candidate Bernie Sanders. The Vermont senator helped Woodfin in his upset mayoral bid, helping him defeat a two-term incumbent backed by establishment Democrats, including Sewell.
 The 55-year-old congresswoman’s mother, Nancy Sewell, added her endorsement Monday, as well. She was the first black woman on the Selma City Council, elected in the decades following the Selma-to-Montgomery marches for voting rights.
 Alabama, where African Americans are expected to cast a majority of primary ballots, has 52 Democratic pledged delegates at stake, part of the 1,357 up for grabs on Super Tuesday. That’s about a third of the party's pledged delegates nationally. Biden is in a cluster atop polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two overwhelmingly white states that begin 2020 voting in early February. But polls consistently show him with a wide lead among black voters who make up significant portions of the states that follow, starting with Nevada and South Carolina and continuing through the Super Tuesday slate.
 Terri Sewell’s announcement comes after Democrats’ most high-profile black presidential candidates -- California Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker -- ended their campaigns. Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick remains.
 Sewell praised the diversity of Democrats’ historically large field and said it “saddens” her to see black candidates drop out. But Sewell said the hand- wringing over Democrats’ all-white slate of remaining top contenders misses Biden’s appeal and deep connections in the black community, especially among older African Americans and black women.

Both moves reflect their forceful personalities and determination to restore their countries to their former glory after years of perceived humiliation by the West. They also mesh with a trend of strong-man rulers taking power from Hungary and Brazil to the Philippines.
 Russia and China are on another level though when it comes to influencing international events — China through its economic might and rising military, Russia through its willingness to insert itself into conflicts such as the Syrian one and to try to influence overseas elections through misinformation or make mischief through cyber attacks.
 Putin “believes that Russia is more powerful today than it has been since the end of the Cold War, including in places such as the Middle East," said Ramon Pacheco Pardo of the Department of European & International Studies at King's College London. “Thus, it is a good time to remain in power and use this power."
 How much of a challenge he and Xi are to Western models, values and multiparty democracy depends on where you sit. The China-Russian model inspires emulation among some in both smaller powers and major nations. President Donald Trump has praised both Xi and Putin, even while the U.S. battles their countries for economic and strategic dominance.
 China touts its authoritarian system as providing the stability and policy continuity that has made it the world’s second-largest economy and pulled some 700 million people out of extreme poverty. Many Russians have backed Putin for standing-up to the West and improving their quality of life following the chaos after the fall of the Soviet Union.
 “Political competition between different systems of governance in the world is nothing new,” said the European Union’s ambassador to China, Nicolas Chapui. “I feel that we need to feel confident on our principles, our values, our governance system.”
 In both their cases, Putin and Xi reflect the tendency of authoritarian leaders to hang onto power for as long as possible and to “die with their boots on,” said David Zweig, professor emeritus of social science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
 “Very few authoritarian leaders give up power, always convinced that only they can save the country, which also justifies and makes their hunger for power morally correct,” Zweig said.
 For all their similarities, Xi, Putin and the systems they run have distinct features. Xi has repeatedly cited the fall of the former Soviet Union as a cautionary tale, saying its leaders failed to firmly uphold the authority of the ruling Communist Party.
 China’s ruling communists have crushed all opposition and are tightening their hold on the economy and what remains of civil society, all while projecting an exterior image of seamless unity around Xi.
 Russia at least maintains some of the forms if not the functions of a multiparty democracy, even as Putin, the security services and the oligarchs who run the economy call the shots.
 Blunt attempts to single-handedly run the country are often met with large- scale protests — like in 2011-2012, when tens of thousands of people took to the streets following Putin’s announcement to return to the presidency for the third time and reports of mass rigging of a parliamentary election.
 And while Putin managed to suppress the opposition with draconian anti-protest laws, crippling fines and arbitrary arrests, people’s growing frustration with the regime continues to spill out on the streets.
 Crippling international sanctions imposed on Russia for the annexation of Crimea drove the country’s economy into a slump, and unpopular reforms like the raising of the retirement age in 2018 only added insult to injury. As a result, Russia has been regularly shaken by protests and unrest in the past two years.
 Putin understands he needs to make changes, former Kremlin speechwriter turned political analyst Abbas Gallyamov told Russia’s Vedomosti newspaper.
 “That is why now he is trying to solve two tasks at the same time: demonstrating to the society that there is no stagnation and, on the opposite, there are reforms, and securing his own political future," he was quoted as saying.
 According to the country’s constitution, Putin will have to step down in 2024, having served two consecutive terms. But the amendments Putin proposed this week would allow him to shift to the prime minister’s seat or continue to run the country as head of the newly defined State Council, a previously consultative body that consists of regional governments and federal officials.

When they see something of a political nature they don’t like, they call the company and urge them to remove the content, sometimes in real time, the executive said. He spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity because he feared retaliation.

Rodgers, who has obviously been in such pressure-packed situations before, agrees wholeheartedly with Adams -- noting it's about mentally shrinking the moment. The eight-time Pro Bowl quarterback says the worst thing the Packers can do is try to play hero ball in Santa Clara.
 "The problem is when you make it bigger than it needs to be, when you try to do too much, when you try and cover for somebody else in your mind, or make up for something that you think needs made up for -- that's when the mistakes happen," he said. "I think if you look at this game, they're definitely favored by what, seven and a half? Is that right? They're expected to hold court and win.
 "People know and they're talking about how we played the last time, so I think if they look at pressure, the pressure is in a certain place and we should be nice and loose."

James shared a memory of interviewing Eminem 20 years ago on the advent him becoming a sensation in the UK and remarked that the controversy was "difficult for him to negotiate".
 Eminem's lyrics are: "I’m contemplating yelling ‘Bombs away’ on the game/Like I’m outside of an Ariana Grande concert waiting."
 "The terrorist attack at that Ariana Grande concert at the Manchester Arena shook us to our core," said James, "there was something so completely despicable about the idea of targeting happy children that it shook us in ways that even other terrorist atrocities haven't shaken us. Eminem has decided to reference this on his latest album."
 After talking about this attack, Eminem compares himself to others including Saddam Hussein and James questions, "He's just doing what Eminem does, isn't he? What do you do if someone is deliberately trying to offend you for money or clicks?"
 "I really don't like this at all. I'd file it under utterly unnecessary," said James, observing that the album could be in no way enhanced by the reference to the "human detritus" that was responsible for this attack.
 "Eminem has always sought to shock in whatever way possible," he continued, "I really don't like this but that is just me being of an age and an outlook where artists setting out to be deliberately shocking and deliberately provocative and deliberately outrageous, very occasionally they get to me and I am actually shocked."

For years, there have been high-powered Linux laptops like Dell's XPS 13 Developer Edition, System76's Serval WS, and ZaReason's UltraLap 6440 i5, but I've never seen anything quite as powerful out of the box as the Kubuntu Focus from the Kubuntu Council, MindShareManagement, and Tuxedo Computer.
 The specs alone are pretty darn impressive. It starts with the CPU. The Focus uses an Intel Core i7-9750H 6 core 4.5GHz Turbo processor. There are faster CPUs out there, but you're not going to find many of them in a laptop. This is backed up by an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 GPU with 6GB of video RAM.
 To run applications with all that processor power, the Focus comes with 32GB of Dual Channel DDR4 2666 RAM. This, in turn, gets its data from a 1TB Samsung 970 EVO Plus NVMe-connected Solid-State Drive (SSD).
 What all that horsepower gives you is an outstanding performance. With the CPU set to 'Performance' mode via the CPU frequency widget, GeekBench 5.0.4, I saw single core measurements of 1,292 and a multi-core rating of 5,734. There are maxed up faster desktop systems, but you'd need to look long and hard for laptops that can give it a run for its money.
 That said, you may find yourself using the Focus in desktop mode more often than you'd like. With great power comes great battery drain. Running the machine hard, I saw a battery life of just less than three hours. When not beating the heck out of it, it came in at a respectable three and a half hours. Still, I'm used to getting five or six hours out of a laptop these days.

"I am so pleased, just that I've wound up where I have, you know," he added. "I'm very fortunate. So, I'm not the kind of guy who--I want to try to keep it classy. We'll see. We'll see if I'm classy or not!"
 In all honesty, though, Downey knows the difference between a good time and a bad one, and right now it's all gravy.
 "Life is an obstacle course and I think," he observed, "if anything, that nothing is ever all OK at the same time. So I think it's important when you have those moments, when personally, professionally, the kids are healthy, you just want to plant a flag and say, this is one of those days where I have no complaints, I've caused no wreckage, and I owe no apologies--this is great."

Unfortunately, snails don't stay put. Our research indicated that targeting snail clusters might not be an efficient way to get rid of them. In fact, it was rare for a snail cluster that we found during one field trip to be present when we returned just a few months later. We went back to the drawing board.
