 If you’ve lost or found a pet, the program should run in about three minutes, providing matches and information.
 At the moment, Finding Rover is only available at HSSC’s shelters, but according to Dallas, plans are in the works for the local municipal shelter, Sonoma County Animal Service to partner with the service also. Finding Rover’s website boasts partnerships with about 700 shelters nationwide.
 “This will help create even better coverage throughout our community and hopefully increase the return to owner rate at both shelters,” Dallas said.
 The app is downloadable on the Apple App Store and Google Play, and all features are also available at findingrover.com.
 “We are hoping that more lost animals are able to return home to the families that love and miss them,” said Dallas.

The Kansas delegation to the U.S. House split along party lines on a nonbinding resolution declaring President Donald Trump must secure approval from Congress before engaging in military action against Iran in wake of the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Iraq.
 U.S. Rep. Roger Marshall, of the rural 1st District and a candidate for U.S. Senate; U.S. Rep. Steve Watkins, of the 2nd District in eastern Kansas; and U.S. Rep. Ron Estes, of the 4th District anchored by Wichita, voted in opposition to the war powers resolution considered a rebuke of the president. Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, of the 3rd District covering Johnson and Wyandotte counties, voted to support the resolution adopted Thursday on a vote of 224-194.
 A similar measure was introduced in the U.S. Senate, which appears to have support from a few Republicans in that chamber. The resolutions are not binding on the president.
 Marshall said the resolution would restrict Trump's ability as commander in chief to defend the country from international threats.
 "If you are a known terrorist who has brutally murdered hundreds of our soldiers and is actively planning to kill more Americans, our leaders have the authority to stop that threat," Marshall said. "We are all safer today because of President Trump's decision."
 Davids said the missile strike that killed Soleimani at a Baghdad airport was ordered "without a clear and coherent strategy for how to deal with the aftermath of such a major escalation."
 "It was also conducted without the consultation of Congress, and I have yet to see the administration demonstrate to Congress that there was an imminent threat," she said.      Watkins, who faces a primary challenger in his bid for re-election, said it would be unacceptable for Congress to tie the hands of a president. He said a fellow West Point graduate was killed in an attack that he attributed to Soleimani.
 "I understand action leads to risk, but inaction leads to more risk in the long run," the congressman said.
 Estes said Trump operated within his authority under a 2002 authorization for use of military force. He said the lawful action sent a message to Iran the United States would defend anyone working to harm Americans or the country's allies.
 "The resolution brought forward today by House Democrats is not binding, but seeks to undermine the ability of the president to protect national security while sending a message of division and weakness to our adversaries like Iran," he said.

After 19 years in business, Ibiza Food & Wine Bar, 2450 Louisiana, will permanently close on Feb. 15. Owners Charles Clark and Grant Cooper may have chosen that date because it's Cooper's birthday. The restaurant's social media has already been sharing throwback photos of the owners and the establishment's famous guests. Now's the time to make reservations to get a last meal at the Midtown stalwart, especially if you want to attend one of its last Paella Sundays. While Ibiza's leaving town, Clark and Cooper's other local spots are thriving: also operate Brasserie 19, Punk's Simple Southern Food and The Dunlavy.

“He funded the research while the center cracked the nut of facial recognition for our furry four-legged friends. The programmers ended up developing an algorithm called Pet Match that uses machine learning and computer vision to pick up on key features of dogs that differentiate them from the rest of the puppy population,” said the article.
 The algorithm uses 138 points on an animal’s face for identification. Finding Rover claims 98% accuracy, though that claim is nearly impossible to verify.
 Locally, every dog and cat that enters the HSSC’s shelter system, at their Santa Rosa and Healdsburg locations, will be registered on Finding Rover. Users of Finding Rover can search the shelter and surrounding areas right from their smartphone or computer in efforts to find their missing pet, a neighbor’s missing pet, the family of a found pet or search for adoptable pets.
 Every dog and cat that leaves HSSC, through a reunion or an adoption, can remain protected on Finding Rover when the owner registers on Finding Rover with the same email address that the shelter has on file. If that dog or cat ever gets lost, their record will already be in the system, and identifying that pet will be simple.
 “We decided to team up with Finding Rover because this technology seemed like another way to help get lost pets back home with their owners,” said Adoption Program Manager Meagan Dallas. “We get a lot of calls each day from people who have lost their pets and we tell them all the things they can do — check the local shelters, put up flyers in your neighborhood, etc. Now, we have one more resource to tell people about to locate their lost pets in hopes of them returning home. We did not have any prior experience with facial recognition technology but it seemed too good to pass up.”
 Finding Rover has a website and a downloadable app. You enter a photo of the pet you have lost (or one you have found) and the program returns a series of photographs and geographic locations for animals its algorithm deems a match for the pictured animal. You can also use the program to search out adoptable pets that match breed or other criteria (for instance, a stock photo of a German Shepherd will yield similar dogs for adoption).

 1\. Upload your pet’s photo

One day I told her that I couldn't go to an appointment because I had soccer practice. It was a joke, but I have to make sure that I'm taking care of myself."

The dramatic blast of more than a dozen missiles caused no casualties at the two bases, although U.S., Canadian and British officials said Thursday that evidence showed that an Iranian anti-aircraft missile probably downed a Ukrainian jetliner near Tehran just a few hours after Iran launched its attack on the Iraqi bases. They said the strike, which killed all 176 people on board, could have been a mistake.

We don't know how long they intend to drag the titular hunt for the Bone Collector out, but there are several more books the show can pivot to if need be. Should this TV series be successful, it would make a lot of sense to wrap up the Bone Collector and begin moving on to Rhyme and Sachs' other cases. There are 14 novels so far in the Rhyme series; "The Vanished Man" in particular would make a great season of television.

This year, as we begin a new decade, I have thought about New Year's resolutions. I have not gone so far as to commit to any, but I have thought about them.
   
 Perhaps the non-pressure approach is the way to go. As usual, I would like to lose some weight and eat more healthy foods. A resolution to keep my feral cat population the same (or to reduce it) is also a logical resolution. I would need the cats' cooperation in order for that one to work, I think. Being grouchy without provocation is another goal I aspire to, but I will need a lot of coffee to help with that. I hope all of my readers who do make resolutions are quite successful with them.
   
 This year I did my usual baking right before Christmas. On several occasions daughter Amy asked what army was going to eat all of the food I prepared. Perhaps next year I will bake less and have more time to watch Hallmark Christmas movies. Husband Gray will be thrilled (not). I did learn something about making cheesecake this year. Apparently it is much more important than I realized to have your cream cheese and eggs at room temperature before you begin. In the past I must have known this, but I forgot this year and made a horrible, lumpy cheesecake. The cherry topping was delicious, however, and Gray ate it anyway. He is such a trooper.

 My amazing friend, Patt Hampton, has sent another great garden pointer. She says you can protect your plants from rabbits by laying down small branches of spiny holly leaves as a barrier around your plants. She also said you can encircle plants with the large seed pods from gum trees. You can gather the pods in the fall and store in a dry place. In early spring, place them firmly in the soil surrounding the plants.
