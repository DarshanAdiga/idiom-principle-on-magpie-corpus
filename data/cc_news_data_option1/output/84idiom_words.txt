‚ÄúThe CM is well aware of the bottleneck and the market position. Our monthly expenditure is around Rs 40 crore, we have to pay about Rs 25-27 crore for gas alone. Moreover, because of frequent breakdown due to obsolete machinery and old technology, the plants could not perform as expected. Namrup III is often plagued with compressor problems and technical snags. These units need extensive maintenance for sustained operations,‚Äù he explained, adding that BVFCL has tied up with NFL to produce a fixed amount of MUKTA or Neem Coated Urea to meet orders from customers across Assam and the Northeast, eastern India, Bangladesh and Nepal.

Apple isn‚Äôt the only company that is having a conversation with law enforcement. Amazon has confirmed that users of the products made by Ring, a home security company, will now allow users to opt out from sharing videos captured by their security cameras, with law enforcement agencies. Late last year, Amazon had faced criticism for partnering with 400 police forces across the US, and allowing them access to footage captured by the cameras installed by Ring users. Amazon had, at the time, called it the ‚Äúnew neighbourhood watch‚Äù (they have a Neighbors app and the Neighbors Portal too). Amazon had acquired Ring in 2018 for around $800 million. Users weren‚Äôt best pleased, forcing the Amazon-owned Ring to offer this opt-out option.

In a cabinet meeting in May 2015, the government of India decided to set up the Namrup IV unit in the BVFCL premises. Initially, it was supposed to have a capacity of 8.646 LMT per annum, but later a proposal came up for installation of a standard-size gas-based ammonia-urea plant with a capacity of 12.70 LMT per annum by forming a joint venture of CPSEs and the Assam government. Under this project, National Fertilizers Limited (NFL) holds a 35 per cent share, Rashtriya Chemicals & Fertilizers Ltd (RCF) 17 per cent, BVFCL 11 per cent, Oil India Ltd 26 per cent and the state government has an 11 per cent stake in the plant.

Apple made an appearance at CES after a gap of 28 years. No new products, which means no new iPhones or iPads were on the agenda. They simply wanted to talk about privacy. Jane Horvath, Senior Director of Global Privacy at Apple spoke about ‚Äúprivacy by design‚Äù, something Apple has talked about since iOS 13 rolled out. And with good effect too. The company detailed how they introduce noise into frequently used emoji datasets to anonymize them, how the company screens content on the iCloud cloud storage service for child pornography and how the processing of the photographs that you click in the Photos app is done on the device itself, which means that information never leaves your iPhone or iPad or Mac.

Then there is Facebook which announced a new version of its Privacy Checkup tool. Perhaps the biggest update which is tool has received in a while. The expanded tool now allows better controls over who can see what you share, how people can find you on Facebook, how to keep your account secure and your data settings on Facebook. "We know privacy is personal, and we've integrated privacy tips to help you make the right privacy decisions for you," Facebook said in an official statement. Erin Egan, VP & Chief Privacy Officer, Policy at Facebook was part of the "Chief Privacy Officer Roundtable: What Do Consumers Want?" session at CES and insisted that Facebook is serious about user data privacy. At times, she did make comparisons with Apple and said that Facebook takes data privacy as seriously as the iPhone maker. While she appreciated the different business models, there is the insistence that privacy protection was primary for both. However, Egan did also hint at the very basic requirement of Facebook‚Äôs business model, which is all about advertising. Smart advertising relies on user data, which means the isolation can only be done to a certain extent. In the end, the data that we generate for Facebook will be used for advertising designed for us. Because that is how things are sold. And money is earned. And profits are generated. ‚ÄúWe're very committed to protecting privacy and our advertising business model,‚Äù she said.
