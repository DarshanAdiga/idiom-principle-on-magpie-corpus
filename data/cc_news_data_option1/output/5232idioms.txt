 # Ohio State returns to College Football Playoff, will face Clemson
 Bill Rabinowitz
 Buckeye Xtra
 Ohio State is returning to the College Football Playoff against a familiar opponent.
 The No. 3 Buckeyes (6-0) will play No. 2 Clemson (10-1) on Jan. 1 in New Orleans, the CFP selection committee announced Sunday afternoon.
 Ohio State will have no shortage of motivation. Clemson has knocked the Buckeyes out of the CFP twice.
 In 2016, the Tigers blanked Ohio State 31-0. Last year’s defeat stung even more. The Buckeyes led 16-0 in the second quarter before losing 29-23 after controversial calls went against them. A last-minute interception in the end zone ended Ohio State’s chances.
 Ohio State vowed to use that devastating loss as fuel for this year, and it has. Through the pandemic, the Buckeyes fought to push the Big Ten into having a season after the conference cancelled it. Players and coaches have lived in near isolation for months in hopes of warding off COVID-19 – only partly successfully – and earning their way back to the College Football Playoff.
 As they were two weeks ago at Michigan State, the Buckeyes were short-handed against Northwestern in the Big Ten championship game Saturday. Ohio State rallied in the second half behind Trey Sermon’s OSU-record 331 rushing yards to prevail over the No. 14 Wildcats 22-10.
 “This team is so tough,” Day said after Saturday’s victory. “They've been through so much, and they just don't flinch. I cannot give this team enough credit. And I'll say this: If we had to play one game against anybody in the country, I'll take the Ohio State Buckeyes.”
 With the Big Ten’s late start and cancellations of the Buckeyes’ games against Maryland, Illinois and Michigan, Ohio State played only six games. The Buckeyes’ shortened season was cited by critics as justification to keep Ohio State out of the playoff, and the selection committee did voice concern about that.
 On Sunday, CFP selection committee chairman Gary Barta, who's the athletic director at Iowa, said Ohio State's undefeated record and league title including victories over Indiana and Northwestern made the Buckeyes a non- controversial choice in the room. He said the disparity in games played among contenders was a season-long issue.
 "We knew that that was going to be a problem," Barta said, "and we were addressing it along the way. But in the end, there was not dissension in the room about naming Ohio State in that third spot."
 Among Power Five conferences, only Alabama was also undefeated. The Southeastern Conference champion Crimson Tide are the top seed and will play Notre Dame in the other CFP semifinal in Dallas. That game was supposed to be played at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif., but California COVID-19 restrictions caused the game to be moved to Texas.
 Clemson avenged its only loss of the season when it rolled over Notre Dame 34-10 in the Atlantic Coast Conference title game on Saturday. The Fighting Irish beat the Tigers 47-40 in double overtime in South Bend on Nov. 7. Clemson was without star quarterback Trevor Lawrence in the first game.
 On Saturday, Clemson dominated. After Notre Dame opened the scoring with a field goal, the Tigers scored the next 34 points.
 Ohio State has never beaten Clemson, and their games have all been program- changing defeats for the Buckeyes. Their first matchup was in the 1978 Gator Bowl and became infamous when Woody Hayes punched Clemson’s Charlie Bauman after the linebacker made a game-clinching interception. Hayes was fired after the game, ending his legendary 28-year career at Ohio State.
 The 2013 Buckeyes lost 40-35 to Clemson in the Orange Bowl. That prompted Ohio State coach Urban Meyer to make defensive coaching changes that became instrumental in Ohio State’s 2014 College Football Playoff championship team.
 After the 2016 loss, Meyer vowed to make offensive changes. Days later, he hired Ryan Day as offensive coordinator.`
 Day succeeded Meyer last year and Ohio State dominated every opponent on its way to the CFP. The underdog Buckeyes were doing the same to Clemson in the Fiesta Bowl. But the game turned when cornerback Shaun Wade was ejected for a hit on Lawrence ruled as targeting.
 Running back J.K. Dobbins then got hurt after a sizzling start and Clemson rallied. A Buckeyes touchdown on a scoop-and-score by safety Jordan Fuller was changed to an incompletion on a controversial replay review.
 After Clemson went 94 yards in only four plays to take the lead with just under 2 minutes left, Ohio State had a final chance. The Buckeyes drove to the Clemson 23, but a miscommunication between quarterback Justin Fields and receiver Chris Olave resulted in a game-clinching interception.
 Olave was one of the players missing from Saturday’s Big Ten title game because of COVID-19. As of now, the Big Ten’s policy of not allowing players to compete for 21 days after a positive test would keep Olave out of this year’s CFP semifinal.
 ESPN reported that the league is expected to reduce that requirement to 17 days. It's unknown whether that would allow Olave and the other affected players to play. Among the other key players who missed Saturday were linebacker Baron Browning, who’s a Texas native, and punter Drue Chrisman.

One of their club-mates Ben Middlebrook recollects an incident to this newspaper: “Josh might have been around 12 or 13, when we played a grade match and Josh just blew away the other team. So after the game, an umpire asked me why we were playing with 20-25-year-old players. I told him he was just 13. He was shocked.”

One by one, several European Union nations banned flights from the UK on Sunday and others were considering similar action in a bid to block a new strain of coronavirus sweeping across southern England from establishing a strong foothold on the continent.
 Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria and Italy all announced restrictions on UK travel, hours after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that Christmas shopping and gatherings in southern England must be cancelled because of rapidly spreading infections blamed on the new coronavirus variant.
 Johnson immediately put those regions into a strict new Tier 4 restriction level, upending Christmas plans for millions.
 The German government said that it's banning flights coming from Britain in reaction to the new coronavirus strain. The transportation ministry said all UK flights with the exception of cargo flights were no longer allowed to land in Germany starting at midnight Sunday. It didn't immediately say how long the flight ban would last.
 The Netherlands banned flights from the UK for at least the rest of the year while Belgium issued a flight ban for 24 hours starting at midnight and also halted train links to Britain, including the Eurostar. Austria and Italy said they would halt flights from the UK but did not say exactly when that would take place.
 Italy's health minister, Roberto Speranza, said an order signed Sunday blocks flights from Britain and prohibits entry into Italy by anyone who has been in the UK in the last 14 days. The order bans plane travel until Jan. 6.
 The Czech Republic imposed stricter quarantine measures from people arriving from Britain. An EU official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks were still ongoing, said Sunday afternoon that the European Commission was in touch with member states on the rapidly developing situation.
 High-speed train operator Eurostar canceled its trains between London, Brussels and Amsterdam beginning Monday, but kept trains operating on the London-to-Paris route.
 Johnson said Saturday that a fast-moving new variant of the virus that is 70% more transmissible than existing strains appeared to be driving the rapid spread of new infections in London and southern England. But he stressed "there's no evidence to suggest it is more lethal or causes more severe illness," or that vaccines will be less effective against it.
 Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said Sunday said he was issuing the flight ban for 24 hours starting at midnight "out of precaution."
 "There are a great many questions about this new mutation," he said, adding he hoped to have more clarity by Tuesday.
 The World Health Organization tweeted late Saturday that it was "in close contact with UK officials on the new #Covid19 virus variant" and promised to update governments and the public as more is learned.
 The new strain was identified in southeastern England in September and has been spreading in the area ever since, a WHO official told the BBC on Sunday.
 "What we understand is that it does have increased transmissibility, in terms of its ability to spread," said Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's technical lead on Covid-19.
 Studies are under way to better understand how fast it spreads and and whether "it's related to the variant itself, or a combination of factors with behavior," she added.
 She said the strain had also been identified in Denmark, the Netherlands and Australia, where there was one case that didn't spread further.
 "The longer this virus spreads, the more opportunities it has to change," she said. "So we really need to do everything we can right now to prevent spread, and minimizing that spread will reduce the chances of it changing."
 Viruses mutate regularly, and scientists have found thousands of different mutations among samples of the virus causing Covid-19. Many of these changes have no effect on how easily the virus spreads or how severe symptoms are.
 Susan Hopkins of Public Health England said while the variant has been circulating since September, it wasn't until the last week that officials felt they had enough evidence to declare that it has higher transmissibility than other circulating coronaviruses.
 U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's nominee for U.S. surgeon general said Sunday that the emergence of the new strain doesn't change the public health guidance on precautions for reducing the spread of the virus, such as wearing masks, social distancing and washing hands.
 "While it seems to be more easily transmissible, we do not have evidence yet that this is a more deadly virus to an individual who acquires it," Vivek Murthy said on NBC's "Meet the Press." "There's no reason to believe that the vaccines that have been developed will not be effective against this virus, as well."
 Europe has been walloped this fall by soaring new infections and deaths due to a resurgence of the virus, and many nations have reimposed a series of restrictions to reign in their outbreaks.
 Britain has seen over 67,000 deaths in the pandemic, the second-highest confirmed toll in Europe after Italy. Europe as a whole has recorded nearly 499,000 virus deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University that experts believe is an undercount, due to limited testing and missed cases.
 The European Medicines Agency, meanwhile, is meeting Monday to approve the first Covid-19 vaccine for the European Union's 27 nations, bringing vaccinations closer for millions of EU citizens. The vaccine made by German pharmaceutical company BioNTech and American drugmaker Pfizer is already in use in the United States, Britain, Canada and other countries.
 The EMA moved up its assessment of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine by a week after heavy pressure from EU governments, especially Germany, which has said that after the EMA approval it could start vaccinating citizens as early as next Sunday.
 In an urgent address to the nation on Saturday, Johnson ordered all non- essential shops, hairdressers and gyms in London and large parts of southern England closed and told Britons to reorganize their holiday plans. No mixing of households is now allowed indoors in the region, and only essential travel is permitted. In the rest of England, people will be allowed to meet in Christmas bubbles for just one day instead of the five that were planned.
 After he spoke, videos emerged online that showed crowds of people rushing to London's train stations, apparently making a dash for places in the UK with less stringent coronavirus restrictions before the new rules took effect. Health Secretary Matt Hancock called those scenes "totally irresponsible."
 While Hancock insisted officials had acted "very quickly and decisively," critics said Britain's Conservative government should have moved against rising infections and hospitalizations much earlier.
 "The alarms bells have been ringing for weeks, but the prime minister chose to ignore them," said Keir Starmer, leader of the opposition Labour Party. "It is an act of gross negligence by a prime minister who, once again, has been caught behind the curve."

Following the recent cold wave, which saw temperatures in the city plunge to as low as four degrees Celsius (minimum) and 13.1 degrees Celsius (maximum), the city is now seeing warmer days.
 On Sunday, Gurugram recorded a maximum temperature of 21 degrees Celsius, while the minimum temperature stood at six degrees Celsius. These readings are the highest in over two weeks. According to the India Meteorological Department(IMD), however, a western disturbance is expected to pass over north India on December 22, which may cause isolated rainfall in some parts, bringing back cold wave conditions to the plains.
 "Cold wave conditions have abated in most parts of northwest India. There is clear sunshine, which is able to warm the surface. The layer of fog has moved away. We are expecting a western disturbance to impact the region around December 22, when moisture will increase and dense fog is likely to envelope the entire region. Cold wave conditions might return," said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the regional weather forecasting centre at IMD.
 As per the IMD's seven-day forecast for Gurugram, shallow to moderate episodes of fog and mist during the early morning hours are expected to persist until at least December 26. Officials said this was due to a high level of humidity, which has set in after the passage of a previous western disturbance about 10 days ago. Under the influence of cold winds from the snow-laden Himalayas, which are sweeping across the plains, this moisture leads to foggy conditions, which dissipate later in the day, under the influence of clear skies. Gurugram recorded relative humidity at 94% on Sunday evening.
 Air quality in the city, meanwhile, remained in the "poor" category of the air quality index (AQI) bulletin for the fifth consecutive day, recording 262 on the Central Pollution Control Board's daily air quality index(AQI). "Despite being in the middle of winter, when pollution levels typically become severe, we are feeling the influence of strong northwestern winds, which keep pollutants from gathering. If it rains this week, the AQI may even come down to the upper end of the 'moderate' category," said Kuldeep Singh, regional officer, Haryana State Pollution Control Board.

Iowa [US], December 20 (ANI): The findings of a new study suggests that responsible consumption of cheese, with red wine, protects one against age- related cognitive problems.
 These are some of the most significant findings of a study by Iowa State University, highlighted in an article published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.
 The study, spearheaded by principal investigator Auriel Willette, an Assistant Professor in Food Science and Human Nutrition Department, and Brandon Klinedinst, a neuroscience PhD candidate, is a first-of-its-kind large scale analysis that connects specific foods to later-in-life cognitive acuity.
 Willette, Klinedinst, and their team analysed data collected from 1,787 ageing adults (46 to 77 years of age) in the United Kingdom through the UK Biobank, a large-scale biomedical database and research resource containing in-depth genetic and health information from half-a-million participants. The database is globally accessible to approved researchers undertaking vital research into the world's most common and life-threatening diseases.
 Participants completed a Fluid Intelligence Test (FIT) through touchscreen questionnaire at baseline (compiled between 2006 and 2010) and then in two follow-up assessments (conducted from 2012 through 2013 and again between 2015 and 2016). The FIT analysis provides an in-time snapshot of an individual's ability to "think on the fly."
 Participants also answered questions about their food and alcohol consumption at baseline and through two follow-up assessments. The Food Frequency Questionnaire asked the participants about their intake of fresh fruit, dried fruit, raw vegetables and salad, cooked vegetables, oily fish, lean fish, processed meat, poultry, beef, lamb, pork, cheese", bread, cereal, tea and coffee, beer, cider, red wine, white wine, champagne and other forms of liquor.
 "I was pleasantly surprised that our results suggest that responsibly eating cheese" and drinking red wine daily are not just good for helping us cope with our current COVID-19 pandemic, but perhaps also dealing with an increasingly complex world that never seems to slow down," Willette said.
 "While we took into account whether this was just due to what well-off people eat and drink, randomised clinical trials are needed to determine if making easy changes in our diet could help our brains in significant ways."
 Klinedinst added depending on their genetic factors, some individuals seem to be more protected from the effects of Alzheimer's, while others seem to be at greater risk.
 "That said, I believe the right food choices can prevent the disease and cognitive decline altogether. Perhaps the silver bullet we're looking for is upgrading how we eat. Knowing what that entails contributes to a better understanding of Alzheimer's and put this disease in a reverse trajectory." (ANI)

"So we really need to do everything we can right now to prevent spread, and minimizing that spread will reduce the chances of it changing."Viruses mutate regularly, and scientists have found thousands of different mutations among samples of the virus causing Covid-19. Many of these changes have no effect on how easily the virus spreads or how severe symptoms are.Susan Hopkins of Public Health England said while the variant has been circulating since September, it wasn't until the last week that officials felt they had enough evidence to declare that it has higher transmissibility than other circulating coronaviruses.U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's nominee for U.S. surgeon general said Sunday that the emergence of the new strain doesn't change the public health guidance on precautions for reducing the spread of the virus, such as wearing masks, social distancing and washing hands."While it seems to be more easily transmissible, we do not have evidence yet that this is a more deadly virus to an individual who acquires it," Vivek Murthy said on NBC's "Meet the Press." "There's no reason to believe that the vaccines that have been developed will not be effective against this virus, as well."Europe has been walloped this fall by soaring new infections and deaths due to a resurgence of the virus, and many nations have reimposed a series of restrictions to reign in their outbreaks.Britain has seen over 67,000 deaths in the pandemic, the second- highest confirmed toll in Europe after Italy. Europe as a whole has recorded nearly 499,000 virus deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University that experts believe is an undercount, due to limited testing and missed cases.The European Medicines Agency, meanwhile, is meeting Monday to approve the first Covid-19 vaccine for the European Union's 27 nations, bringing vaccinations closer for millions of EU citizens. The vaccine made by German pharmaceutical company BioNTech and American drugmaker Pfizer is already in use in the United States, Britain, Canada and other countries.The EMA moved up its assessment of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine by a week after heavy pressure from EU governments, especially Germany, which has said that after the EMA approval it could start vaccinating citizens as early as next Sunday.In an urgent address to the nation on Saturday, Johnson ordered all non-essential shops, hairdressers and gyms in London and large parts of southern England closed and told Britons to reorganize their holiday plans. No mixing of households is now allowed indoors in the region, and only essential travel is permitted. In the rest of England, people will be allowed to meet in Christmas bubbles for just one day instead of the five that were planned.After he spoke, videos emerged online that showed crowds of people rushing to London's train stations, apparently making a dash for places in the UK with less stringent coronavirus restrictions before the new rules took effect. Health Secretary Matt Hancock called those scenes "totally irresponsible."While Hancock insisted officials had acted "very quickly and decisively," critics said Britain's Conservative government should have moved against rising infections and hospitalizations much earlier."The alarms bells have been ringing for weeks, but the prime minister chose to ignore them," said Keir Starmer, leader of the opposition Labour Party. "It is an act of gross negligence by a prime minister who, once again, has been caught behind the curve."

“The white stone is for my granddaughter who was born last year, seven weeks premature. It was touch and go for a while, but those nurses and doctors never left her side and she’s happy and healthy; my perfect little angel now. “
 She reached for the waitress’s hand. "And this last stone is from a neighbor of mine. That year I was dealing with health problems, we’d fallen behind on the yard work and, without anyone asking, the man across the street showed up with his teenage son and raked our yard.
 "Somewhere under the leaves they found this stone and he left it in the mailbox for me. I thought it looked like a heart, so I kept it to remind me of his friendship.”
 She looked into the waitress's eyes, squeezed her hand and finished. ”Hard times can be the best times. These stones remind me of that. They keep me on the path”.
 A bell rang and the waitress excused herself to go to grab someone’s order. When she returned to the corner booth to thank the old woman for sharing her story, she was gone. Just an empty tea cup, three dollars folded in half and small rust-colored stone in the shape of a heart holding the money neatly in place.
 She put it in her pocket and smiled. It was the nicest gift she’d ever received.
 As we celebrate this season of giving, I share, once again, this tiny fable as my gift and urge you to reach into your own life and close your fingers tight around those precious stones or memories that sustain and heal. 2020 has been one of the toughest years in a century. Just remember storms pass, ice thaws and, in the end, love wins.
 The man whose birthday we celebrate on Friday is a testament to that. Merry Christmas.

Gurugram Following the recent cold wave, which saw temperatures in the city plunge to as low as four degrees Celsius (minimum) and 13.1 degrees Celsius (maximum), the city is now seeing warmer days. On Sunday, Gurugram recorded a maximum temperature of 21 degrees Celsius, while the minimum temperature stood at six degrees Celsius. These readings are the highest in over two weeks. According to the India Meteorological Department(IMD), however, a western disturbance is expected to pass over north India on December 22, which may cause isolated rainfall in some parts, bringing back cold wave conditions to the plains."Cold wave conditions have abated in most parts of northwest India. There is clear sunshine, which is able to warm the surface. The layer of fog has moved away. We are expecting a western disturbance to impact the region around December 22, when moisture will increase and dense fog is likely to envelope the entire region. Cold wave conditions might return," said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the regional weather forecasting centre at IMD.As per the IMD's seven-day forecast for Gurugram, shallow to moderate episodes of fog and mist during the early morning hours are expected to persist until at least December 26. Officials said this was due to a high level of humidity, which has set in after the passage of a previous western disturbance about 10 days ago. Under the influence of cold winds from the snow-laden Himalayas, which are sweeping across the plains, this moisture leads to foggy conditions, which dissipate later in the day, under the influence of clear skies. Gurugram recorded relative humidity at 94% on Sunday evening.Air quality in the city, meanwhile, remained in the "poor" category of the air quality index (AQI) bulletin for the fifth consecutive day, recording 262 on the Central Pollution Control Board's daily air quality index(AQI). "Despite being in the middle of winter, when pollution levels typically become severe, we are feeling the influence of strong northwestern winds, which keep pollutants from gathering. If it rains this week, the AQI may even come down to the upper end of the 'moderate' category," said Kuldeep Singh, regional officer, Haryana State Pollution Control Board.
