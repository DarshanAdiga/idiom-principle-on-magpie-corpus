RUGBY  UNION : Dalby’s inclusion as a 2020 Super Rugby launch pad is set to create unprecedented interest as the countdown continues to next week’s historic trial match in the town.
 The Queensland Reds and New South Wales Waratahs will break new ground in Dalby when they meet in a Super Rugby season pipe-opener next Friday night at Dalby RLFC ground.
 It will be the final trial match for both teams which play in Gladstone and Sydney this weekend leading up to the season kick-off on January 31.
 Next week’s Reds and Waratahs clash is the first time the arch rugby rivals have met on the Downs since NSW defeated Queensland at Toowoomba’s Gold Park in 2009.
 The match caps a gala week of activities and appearances in Dalby and surrounding areas involving both teams.
 Downs Rugby general manager Matt Hammond said securing the game is a feather in the cap of numerous backers and Dalby rugby followers and sport fans are embracing their first opportunity to host a gallery of international stars.
 The Reds’ squad includes former Downs juniors Harry Hoopert, who began his rugby rise with Dalby Wheatmen, and Hamish Stewart.
 “This opportunity has been made possible through the support of the Wheatmen, Dalby Leagues club, the QRU, Western Downs Regional Council and its mayor Paul McVeigh,” Hammond said.
 “More than 1000 tickets to the game have been pre-sold, 10 days out from kick- off.
 “We’ve had ticket sales originate from as far away as South Australia while there is also good interest from people in northern New South Wales and the Tablelands’ region.
 “We have purposely made the tickets attractively priced due to the ongoing drought conditions and we expect to field a lot of further interest during next week’s build-up.”
 The Reds arrive in Dalby on Wednesday and NSW on Thursday morning.
 Tickets can be purchased at www.trybooking.com
 The match kicks off at 7.30pm.
