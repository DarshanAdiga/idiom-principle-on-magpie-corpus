Comet SWAN is projected to get brighter by the middle of the month and will make its closest approach to Earth on May 13 at a distance of around 50 million miles.
 "That's not a particularly close approach; nevertheless, it could put on a good show. If current trends continue, the comet may be brighter than 3rd magnitude (like stars in the Pleiades) as it glides through the constellation Pisces," SpaceWeather.com said.

 Comets can be fickle and unpredictable, so only time will tell the fate of Comet SWAN. Be sure to follow AccuWeather Astronomy on Twitter for future updates on the comet.
 On the night of April 7 into April 8, people around the globe were treated to the biggest and brightest supermoon of the year. Just one week later, the moon put on another show, meeting up with Jupiter, Saturn and Mars in the early- morning sky on April 15.
 By the time that the Lyrid meteor shower reached its peak near the end of the month, the moon was in its new phase. This allowed onlookers to enjoy the first meteor shower since January on a night without the moon shining bright.
 A mile-wide asteroid zipped past the Earth on Wednesday, April 29, giving some people the opportunity to spot the giant space rock with their telescopes. Although it was called a "Potentially Hazardous Asteroid," it poses no risk of hitting the planet in the near future.
 Deeper in the expanse of the universe, astronomers have discovered a star orbiting a supermassive black hole in the heart of the Milky Way galaxy in such a way that once again fell in line with Einstein's theory of general relativity.
 Back on Earth, NASA attached a small helicopter to the Perseverance rover that will travel to Mars later this year. This will become the first helicopter to fly on another planet.
 Astronomers celebrated the anniversary of the Hubble Space Telescope, which launched into space 30 years ago. Hubble has sent back incredible images of the universe and has led to major discoveries.

In terms of core equity Tier 1, as I mentioned, the impact in core equity Tier 1, looking forward it will depend on markets, and obviously, read where industries grow.
