Jones estimates that the pandemic wiped out 60% of his income this year. With his shops closed, the single dad, who has a 10-year-old daughter, is doing odd jobs on building sites -- and praying that business will return enough to ease the pain once restrictions lift on Dec. 2. The five other barbers who work in his shops are self-employed, and trying to scrape by as well.


  "It could be really tough if it carries on," Jones said, as he put up Christmas lights in his empty shop on Hackney's Broadway Market.


  Hackney has seen steady gentrification in the past two decades. Located in London's historically gritty East End, the borough was once known as the home of a stretch dubbed "Murder Mile," but Hackney is now filled with trendy bars and expensive apartments.


  Broadway Market itself is lined with some 60 small shops, cafes and restaurants, and before COVID-19 hit, the street would throng with locals and tourists coming for the hugely popular weekend market. These days, some shops are doing better than others, but everyone is scrambling to adapt.


  Jane Howe, who has run Broadway Bookshop since 2005, said the weekends would often get so busy that her shop would take in thousands of pounds in sales per day on the back of 7.99-pound books.


  For a shop that relies heavily on foot traffic, the cycles of coronavirus restrictions have been hard. In June, Howe launched a website for the first time.


  Even once her doors reopened, the tiny space meant she couldn't welcome back her usual crowds. Sales from the website don't come close to making up for the in-person ones she's lost -- especially during the crucial Christmas period, when her shop typically rakes in a third of its annual sales.


  "We're missing out on the impulse buys, the 'sweetie by the till factor,'" she said.


  With the shop pulling in just over half what it used to, Howe has stopped paying herself and, when one of her two employees left, she was not able to replace her.


  Like Jones, she's managed to keep paying the rent thanks to a government grant. She has also taken out a 50,000-pound state loan.


  "What we are doing, which is our best, I think is working for the moment," she said.


  Others haven't fared as well. A much-loved bakery next to Sharpes that was part of 66-year-old family-run chain closed for good, Jones said.


  Percy Ingle blamed the closure of its 48 bakeries on many factors that predated the pandemic, including rising rents and wages and the likelihood that the low-margin business wouldn't provide a good return on needed capital investments. Like many businesses, even those that were allowed to remain open, it shut for several weeks in the spring before reopening with safety measures.


  The bakery closure stands in contrast to a trend seen on much of the street, whose butchers, fishmongers, greengrocers and delis have done relatively well thanks to a surge in interest from fairly affluent locals who are now working from home and doing more shopping in the neighborhood.


  Popular coffee shop and roastery Climpsons struggled to adapt at first -- the cafe was shut, the wholesale business almost completely wiped out, and 34 of the company's 42 workers went on the government furlough scheme in the first weeks of the pandemic, co-owner Danny Davies said.


  But now on weekdays, Climpsons often serves more take-away coffees than before the pandemic. That makes up for losses on the wholesale side, which supplied restaurants and offices.


  "There's the suburban community high street success story I think, which is a lot of great local businesses are thriving -- much higher sales than before even, if they sell things that people can grab and go home with," Davies said.


  Down the street, Grigorios Vaitsas says business at his deli, Isle of Olive, has not been too bad, even though he closed his small indoor cafe and Christmas shopping events have been canceled.


  But Vaitsas and his partner, Paulina, who import their products from Greece, have been losing sleep over another threat: Brexit.


  The couple are worried about the tariffs and bureaucracy if Britain leaves the economic embrace of the EU at the end of the year with no deal in place. That combined with the pandemic makes a "perfect storm," Vaitsas said.


  "We are holding our breath," he said.


  Vaitsas laughed when asked where he sees himself in six months. He says he's "operating on a week by week basis."


  Other business owners agree that they don't have the capacity to think too far ahead.


  "Most business people sort of wrote this year off…. Let's just keep our heads down, pay our bills, pay the rent, and try not to worry," said Jones. "And next year is another year, and we can start again."

BETHLEHEM, Pa., Nov. 30, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OraSure Technologies, Inc. ( OSUR), a leader in the fight against HIV, today announced its plans to commemorate World AIDS Day. On Tuesday, Dec. 1st, OraSure will ring the closing bell for the NASDAQ Stock Market, in a virtual ceremony that will be livestreamed.  


  "A year ago, on World AIDS Day 2019, it appeared that eliminating the HIV epidemic was within our grasp. Today, we're in a far different place as COVID-19 has disrupted the delivery of testing, services and care, reversing many of the gains we've made," said OraSure President and CEO, Stephen S. Tang, Ph.D. "Today, on World AIDS Day 2020, it's time to put a stake in the ground: We cannot let the HIV epidemic take a back seat to COVID-19. At OraSure, we are proud of the ways in which we are meeting the global need for HIV diagnostics, and we are committed to doing the same for COVID-19."


  To commemorate World AIDS Day globally, OraSure also partnered with the MTV Staying Alive Foundation on a video campaign, based around an African television series MTV Shuga, which encourages young adults to take an HIV self-test. Furthermore, in Kenya, the Ministry of Health has partnered with OraSure to pilot electronic vending machines for HIV self-test kits. The machines will launch on World AIDS Day. The widely used OraQuick® HIV Self- Test was the first WHO-prequalified HIV self-test in Sub-Saharan Africa.

It's getting pretty difficult to make a laptop that stands out. There are countless thin and light notebooks with comfortable keyboards, beautiful screens and enough power for most professional workflows. To really make an impression, manufacturers have to introduce some unique features that rise above mere gimmickry. HP's latest attempt is something called Presence Aware on the EliteBook 1040, which lets the machine know when you're in front of it so that it can dim the screen when you leave and wake up when you return. There's also a new AI noise reduction tool to make your voice sound clearer on calls. Though we don't review many commercial laptops like HP's EliteBook series, we're making an exception this time because interesting new features like Presence Aware and AI Noise Reduction tend to show up in HP's consumer models after debuting in business-first lines. The $1,560 EliteBook 1040 is our first chance to determine if these are actually useful or if they're actually useful.

Jones estimates that the pandemic wiped out 60% of his income this year. With his shops closed, the single dad, who has a 10-year-old daughter, is doing odd jobs on building sites -- and praying that business will return enough to ease the pain once restrictions lift on Dec. 2. The five other barbers who work in his shops are self-employed, and trying to scrape by as well.
 "It could be really tough if it carries on," Jones said, as he put up Christmas lights in his empty shop on Hackney's Broadway Market.
 Hackney has seen steady gentrification in the past two decades. Located in London's historically gritty East End, the borough was once known as the home of a stretch dubbed "Murder Mile," but Hackney is now filled with trendy bars and expensive apartments.
 Broadway Market itself is lined with some 60 small shops, cafes and restaurants, and before COVID-19 hit, the street would throng with locals and tourists coming for the hugely popular weekend market. These days, some shops are doing better than others, but everyone is scrambling to adapt.
 Jane Howe, who has run Broadway Bookshop since 2005, said the weekends would often get so busy that her shop would take in thousands of pounds in sales per day on the back of 7.99-pound books.
 For a shop that relies heavily on foot traffic, the cycles of coronavirus restrictions have been hard. In June, Howe launched a website for the first time.
 Even once her doors reopened, the tiny space meant she couldn't welcome back her usual crowds. Sales from the website don't come close to making up for the in-person ones she's lost -- especially during the crucial Christmas period, when her shop typically rakes in a third of its annual sales.
 "We're missing out on the impulse buys, the 'sweetie by the till factor,'" she said.
 With the shop pulling in just over half what it used to, Howe has stopped paying herself and, when one of her two employees left, she was not able to replace her.
 Like Jones, she's managed to keep paying the rent thanks to a government grant. She has also taken out a 50,000-pound state loan.
 "What we are doing, which is our best, I think is working for the moment," she said.
 Others haven't fared as well. A much-loved bakery next to Sharpes that was part of 66-year-old family-run chain closed for good, Jones said.
 Percy Ingle blamed the closure of its 48 bakeries on many factors that predated the pandemic, including rising rents and wages and the likelihood that the low-margin business wouldn't provide a good return on needed capital investments. Like many businesses, even those that were allowed to remain open, it shut for several weeks in the spring before reopening with safety measures.
 The bakery closure stands in contrast to a trend seen on much of the street, whose butchers, fishmongers, greengrocers and delis have done relatively well thanks to a surge in interest from fairly affluent locals who are now working from home and doing more shopping in the neighborhood.
 Popular coffee shop and roastery Climpsons struggled to adapt at first -- the cafe was shut, the wholesale business almost completely wiped out, and 34 of the company's 42 workers went on the government furlough scheme in the first weeks of the pandemic, co-owner Danny Davies said.
 But now on weekdays, Climpsons often serves more take-away coffees than before the pandemic. That makes up for losses on the wholesale side, which supplied restaurants and offices.
 "There's the suburban community high street success story I think, which is a lot of great local businesses are thriving -- much higher sales than before even, if they sell things that people can grab and go home with," Davies said.
 Down the street, Grigorios Vaitsas says business at his deli, Isle of Olive, has not been too bad, even though he closed his small indoor cafe and Christmas shopping events have been canceled.
 But Vaitsas and his partner, Paulina, who import their products from Greece, have been losing sleep over another threat: Brexit.
 The couple are worried about the tariffs and bureaucracy if Britain leaves the economic embrace of the EU at the end of the year with no deal in place. That combined with the pandemic makes a "perfect storm," Vaitsas said.
 "We are holding our breath," he said.
 Vaitsas laughed when asked where he sees himself in six months. He says he's "operating on a week by week basis."
 Other business owners agree that they don't have the capacity to think too far ahead.
 "Most business people sort of wrote this year off…. Let's just keep our heads down, pay our bills, pay the rent, and try not to worry," said Jones. "And next year is another year, and we can start again."

“Obviously we are doing everything in our power to increase the capacity and accelerate the timelines,” he said.


  Both Moderna's and Pfizer's vaccines are made with the same technology, using a piece of genetic code for the “spike” protein that studs the virus. That messenger RNA, or mRNA, instructs the body to make some harmless spike protein, training immune cells to recognize it if the real virus eventually comes along.


  ASTRAZENECA CONFUSION


  AstraZeneca last week announced confusing early results of its vaccine candidate from research in Britain and Brazil


  That vaccine appears 62% effective when tested as originally intended, with recipients given two full doses. But because of a manufacturing error, a small number of volunteers got a lower first dose — and AstraZeneca said in that group, the vaccine appeared to be 90% effective.


  Experts say it’s unclear why the lower-dose approach would work better and that it may just be a statistical quirk.


  A larger U.S. study of the AstraZeneca candidate still is underway that should eventually give the FDA a better picture of how well it works. The FDA has said any COVID-19 vaccine would have to be at least 50% effective.


  Meanwhile Britain’s government will have to decide whether its U.K. data is sufficient for an early rollout there.


  STILL IN THE PIPELINE


  Johnson & Johnson also is in final-stage testing in the U.S. and several other countries to see if its vaccine candidate could work with just one dose.


  Both the J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines work by using harmless cold viruses to carry the spike protein gene into the body and prime the immune system.


  The different technologies have ramifications for how easily different vaccines could be distributed globally. The AstraZeneca shots won't require freezer storage like the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.


  Candidates made with still other technologies are in late-stage testing, too. Another U.S. company, Novavax Inc., announced Monday that it has finished enrolling 15,000 people in a late-stage study in Britain and plans to begin recruiting even more volunteers for final testing in the U.S. and Mexico “in the coming weeks.”


  Vaccines made by three Chinese companies and a Russian candidate also are being tested in thousands of people in countries around the world.

It's getting pretty difficult to make a laptop that stands out. There are countless thin and light notebooks with comfortable keyboards, beautiful screens and enough power for most professional workflows. To really make an impression, manufacturers have to introduce some unique features that rise above mere gimmickry. HP's latest attempt is something called Presence Aware on the EliteBook 1040, which lets the machine know when you're in front of it so that it can dim the screen when you leave and wake up when you return. There's also a new AI noise reduction tool to make your voice sound clearer on calls.


  Though we don't review many commercial laptops like HP's EliteBook series, we're making an exception this time because interesting new features like Presence Aware and AI Noise Reduction tend to show up in HP's consumer models after debuting in business-first lines. The $1,560 EliteBook 1040 is our first chance to determine if these are actually useful or if they're actually useful.

Honeywell stands to benefit from continued strength across its defense and space businesses, supported by strong U.S. government defense budgets. Also, solid demand for warehouse automation products and high backlog level bode well for its Intelligrated business. Going forward, solid product offerings, recovery in business aviation aftermarket, strong demand for personal protective equipment and growth opportunities across building solutions and safety products businesses might also act as tailwinds for the company.                                Also, the acquisition of Ballard Unmanned Systems (October 2020) is expected to enhance growth scopes for Honeywell in the unmanned aerial systems market. Moreover, its buyout of Rocky Research in the same month will boost growth opportunities for its existing offerings in the energy storage, power and thermal management, and power generation arenas. In addition, various cost-control measures adopted by the company have enabled it to reduce costs by about $1,050 million year over year in the first nine months of 2020.                                Moreover, Honeywell remains committed to rewarding shareholders handsomely through dividend payments and share buybacks. In the first nine months of 2020, the company used $1,921 million for paying out dividends, and repurchasing shares worth $2,149 million. Notably, the quarterly dividend rate was hiked by 3.3% in September 2020.                                Despite the positives, headwinds across its commercial original equipment business owing to lower air transport, slowdown in original equipment build rates and lower business jet demand are likely to affect its top-line performance in the near term. Also, soft outlook for oil and gas capital expenditure, weakness in its UOP business and automation project delays in process solutions business are likely to affect the company’s performance.                                  In addition, Honeywell’s high-debt profile poses a concern. In the last five years (2015-2019), its long-term debt increased 14.9% (CAGR). The metric was $17,687 million at the end of the third quarter of 2020, reflecting an increase of 0.5% on a sequential basis. Any further increase in debt levels can raise the company’s financial obligations.                                             *[FT]: Financial Times

The physical joy of using the SYNTRX combined with its implicit encouragement of experimentation make it easy to get lost in. There's a learning curve, but once you come to grips with the basics there's no denying its charms. Almost every time I use it I discover something new. It joins an elite group of instruments I've reviewed (the Minilogue XD and Moog Subharmonicon being the other two) that immediately inspired me to build a new song around it.


  But, the SYNTRX is clearly not for the casual noodler. You need to be serious about your craft to drop almost $3,000 on an instrument. And more than many other synths I've reviewed, it's going to take a lot of time and dedication to master. However, it's also a unique device that more experimentally minded musicians will undoubtedly find quite alluring.

__Another day another surprising celebrity flirt-exchange on social media, this time between Kourtney Kardashian and _The Undoing's_ Edgar Ramirez, who shared a very flirty Instagram Story response after she posted about the series.


  The Kardashians, like the rest of us, are clearly big fans of Sky's edge-of- your-seat psychological thriller _The Undoing_ , which follows and with the series coming to an end Kourtney spoke for us all when she took to Instagram on Saturday to ponder just who killed Elena Alves? __


  Kourtney posted a series of pictures of her lounging in various places around her house wearing a pale lilac bikini top and matching flared trousers, she then captioned the post, "Who killed Elena Alves?"


  Of course, this prompted a lot of discussion in the comments with one person saying, "My moneys on the husband," and another saying, "I swear the child". Nicole Kidman herself, who plays Grace Fraser on the hit series, even got involved, commenting, "I have a few guesses 🤔."


  Then, late last night Edgar Ramirez, who plays Detective Joe Mendoza, posted quite the flirty response to Kourtney in his Instagram Stories.


  Sharing a screengrab of Kourtney's original post, Ramirez commented, "I'm all ears 😉." And as we all well know, the winky face speaks a thousand volumes.

 # Colleges: SU women welcome Mangakahia with open arms
 By Doug Feinberg
 AP Basketball Writer
 Tiana Mangakahia admits she was emotional on the bus ride to Stony Brook.
 Syracuse's senior guard hadn't played a competitive game in 615 days after being diagnosed with breast cancer. She missed last season to undergo chemotherapy and then had a double mastectomy last November.
 “There was a lot going through my mind,” Mangakahia said after a 50-39 victory over Stony Brook on Sunday. “Especially on the bus. In the warmups, there was less emotions because I was just focused. But on the bus, I was very emotional and I just couldn’t believe that this day was here and I was going to be able to play.”
 She had 16 points, seven rebounds, four steals and three assists for the No. 23 Orange. Mangakahia, the school’s all-time assist leader, got involved quickly with a pass to Amaya Finklea-Guity for a layup to open the scoring. A few minutes later, Mangakahia got a steal and scored her first points in almost two years on a fast-break layup.
 “It was so nice to be on the court and just to be able to play," Mangakahia said. “I didn’t expect me to be really amazing, but I wanted that. I just tried my hardest and that’s what I wanted to do.”
 Before tipoff, Syracuse coach Quentin Hillsman hugged his star, who was born and raised in Australia.
 “I’m just so grateful that she has the opportunity to play again,” Hillsman said. “Some people lose their life and she’s here and playing for us. I’m very thankful and grateful.”
 Mangakahia was diagnosed in June 2019 and went through eight rounds of chemotherapy and two operations. She put her WNBA ambitions on hold in April 2019 and chose to return to Syracuse for her final year of eligibility.
 Two months later, she discovered a lump that was diagnosed as invasive ductal carcinoma. After undergoing treatment, she was forced to watch last season from the bench because she was not cleared for competition.
 She knows she still has to get her stamina back and admitted she wasn't as fast as she was before the illness. Mangakahia played 36 minutes and shot 4-for-13 from the field, and hit seven of her eight free throw attempts. She also had five turnovers.
 “If I was to rate my performance out of 100, I wasn’t extremely happy with how I played, but I’m just glad we got the win,” Mangakahia said. “So I’d probably say like an 85. I just felt super happy to be on the court, and I just wanted to play really good.”
 Syracuse will play its home opener on Wednesday.
 “I’m really looking forward to it,” she said.

Moderna Inc. said it would ask U.S. and European regulators Monday to allow emergency use of its COVID-19 vaccine as new study results confirm the shots offer strong protection — ramping up the race to begin limited vaccinations as the coronavirus rampage worsens.


  Multiple vaccine candidates must succeed for the world to stamp out the pandemic, which has been on the upswing in the U.S. and Europe. U.S. hospitals have been stretched to the limit as the nation has seen more than 160,000 new cases per day and more than 1,400 daily deaths. Since first emerging nearly a year ago in China, the virus has killed more than 1.4 million people worldwide.


  Moderna is one of several companies to have already submitted partial data to a "rolling review" process offered by Health Canada. Rather than presenting regulators with a complete package of trial results, the would-be vaccine- makers file data and findings as they become available. Canada has been looking at Moderna's first results since mid-October.


  Canada has a different approval process than the United States and European countries, meaning that Moderna and Pfizer do not have to apply or reapply at each step. Instead, they have to submit their newest data and findings.


  Moderna created its shots with the U.S. National Institutes of Health and already had a hint they were working, but said it got the final needed results over the weekend that suggest the vaccine is more than 94% effective.


  Of 196 COVID-19 cases so far in its huge U.S. study, 185 were trial participants who received the placebo and 11 who got the real vaccine. The only people who got severely ill — 30 participants, including one who died — had received dummy shots, said Dr. Tal Zaks, the Cambridge, Massachusetts, company's chief medical officer.


  When he learned the results, “I allowed myself to cry for the first time,” Zaks told The Associated Press. “We have already, just in the trial, have already saved lives. Just imagine the impact then multiplied to the people who can get this vaccine.”


  Moderna said the shots’ effectiveness and a good safety record so far — with only temporary, flu-like side effects — mean they meet requirements set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency use before the final-stage testing is complete. The European Medicines Agency, Europe’s version of FDA, has signalled it also is open to faster, emergency clearance.


  WHAT COMES NEXT


  The FDA has pledged that before it decides to roll out any COVID-19 vaccines, its scientific advisers will publicly debate whether there’s enough evidence behind each candidate.


  First up on Dec. 10, Pfizer and BioNTech will present data suggesting their vaccine candidate is 95% effective. Moderna said its turn at this “science court” is expected exactly a week later, on Dec. 17.


  RATIONING INITIAL DOSES


  If the FDA allows emergency use, Moderna expects to have 20 million doses ready for the U.S. by year’s end. Recipients will need two doses, so that’s enough for 10 million people.


  Pfizer expects to have 50 million doses globally in December. Half of them — or enough for 12.5 million people — are earmarked for the U.S.


  This week, a different panel of U.S. experts, established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will meet to decide how initial supplies will be given out. They're expected to reserve scarce first doses for health care workers and, if the shots work well enough in the frail elderly, for residents of long-term care facilities. As more vaccine gradually becomes available in coming months, other essential workers and people at highest risk from the coronavirus would get in line. But enough for the general population isn't expected until at least spring.


  Outside the U.S., Zaks said significant supplies from Moderna would be available later, “in the first quarter” of next year.

The Tigers were without safeties Lannden Zanders and Jalyn Phillips, as well as cornerbacks Derion Kendrick and Sheridan Jones. Despite that, the secondary intercepted QB Kenny Pickett four times. CB Malcolm Greene grabbed an interception off a deflected pass. CB Andrew Booth sprinted to the middle of the field and made an acrobatic play to intercept a deep pass. Mario Goodrich showed good reaction time to catch a pass that bounced off a Pittsburgh wide receiver’s hands and caromed his way. He added a second interception for good measure later in the game. Clemson held Kenny Pickett, one of the ACC’s better QBs, to just 22/39 passing for 209 yards, 2 TDs, and 4 INTs.
