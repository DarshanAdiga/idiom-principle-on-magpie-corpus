SAVANNAH, Ga. (WTOC) - Georgia’s Secretary of State announced on Monday a signature audit of absentee ballot envelopes in Cobb County.Following that, there will be a statewide audit study to make sure each signature match was executed properly.Chatham County Voter Registration showed WTOC how they determine a signature match.All these absentee ballots are waiting to get signature verified by workers at Chatham County Voter Registration. As of last week, workers tell me, more than 6,700 absentee ballots have been processed. This means signatures were verified and ballots were entered into the system.Once absentee ballots are counted and logged, workers go through each ballot to verify the voter’s signature.Workers will find the voter in the system, and different electronic documents will pop up that they can compare the signature on the ballot to. Most of the electronic documents are from when the voter signed something from the Department of Motor Vehicles.If no electronic documents are available, the Voter Registration office goes through boxes to find a paper document with their signature on it. These are usually forms they signed and submitted to the registration office from a previous election.Once workers have a document signature to compare the ballot signature to, they examine each stroke of each letter to make sure they match.If they do, they sign the ballot with a red pen, meaning it’s been verified.If the signature can’t be verified, the office will send this cure affidavit form to the voter, which must be turned in by Jan. 8.Copyright 2020 WTOC.

Meanwhile, the number in temporary accommodation jumped by 6,000 shortly after the pandemic struck.


  Yet it’s also true that charities such as Shelter, and people like you and communities like yours, have achieved the impossible time and again this year.


  Whether via donations, volunteering, hard work or just plain kindness, hungry families have been fed, lonely people comforted and homeless people housed. Families, neighbours, trade unions, mutual aid groups, local councils and charities have all played a role in holding the country together as we battle through a pandemic on the back of years of grinding austerity.


  As Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, which helped get Gemma, Emma and thousands of others housed, says: “With this deadly virus on the loose, 2020 has taught us the value of a safe home like never before.”


  Gemma’s housing problems pre-date Covid-19. After a difficult start in life, she ended up in a hostel then a string of temporary accommodations. “I had my baby living in a tiny little room,” she says. “It was a drug den, there was no electricity in the kitchen for six months and I had no oven.”

  # Judge sides with transgender residents in birth-records case


  Marc Kovac


  The Columbus Dispatch


  A federal judge in Ohio has sided with transgender residents who sought to overturn a state policy that blocked them from changing sex markers on their birth certificates.


  U.S. District Judge Michael H. Watson granted summary judgment Wednesday to four transgender individuals, noting that the state had allowed such birth certificate changes in years past.


  The policy, Watson wrote, “resembles the sort of discrimination-based legislation struck down under the equal protection clause… as nothing more than a policy ‘born of animosity toward the class of person affected’ that has ‘no rational relation to a legitimate government purpose.'"


  He added, "The court finds defendants' policy to be unconstitutional and hereby permanently enjoins defendants from enforcing their policy."


  The leader of the Gainesville-based American College of Pediatricians, Quentin Van Veter, was deposed in the case as an expert witness.


  Van Meter, an Atlanta-based pediatric endocrinologist, said in his sworn testimony that he does not believe individuals should be allowed to change their sex on birth certificates.


  The Southern Poverty Law Center deems the organization a hate group, which the organization vehemently denies. Plaintiffs in the case praised the decision.


  “Today’s ruling affirms that the state must recognize the dignity and true identity of every transgender Ohioan,” Elizabeth Bonham, ACLU of Ohio staff attorney, said in a prepared statement. “It is incredibly frustrating that our clients faced years of unlawful discrimination, but today we celebrate this victory as an acknowledgement to their commitment to justice.”


  Kara Ingelhart, Staff Attorney at Lambda Legal, added, “Finally, transgender people from Ohio will be able to correct their birth certificates so that this necessary identity document is consistent with their gender identities. Accurate birth certificates are essential. They are foundational to our ability to access a variety of benefits such as employment and housing, and to navigate the world freely and safely, as who we truly are. Courts across the country have overwhelmingly determined these archaic and harmful laws are unconstitutional and today we are closer than ever to eradicating them once and for all.”


  A spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Health said late Wednesday afternoon that officials were reviewing the decision.


  The plaintiffs sued the heads of the Ohio Department of Health and the state Office of Vital Statistics in March 2018, alleging that Ohio’s birth certificate policies were unconstitutional. The three transgender women and one transgender man had sought unsuccessfully to change their birth certificates to reflect their identified gender.


  Ohio is one of two states that bar such changes, a policy that “erects a barrier to the full recognition, participation and inclusion of transgender people in society and subjects them to discrimination, privacy invasions, harassment, humiliation, stigma, harm to their health and even violence,” according to the original complaint.


  State officials sought a dismissal of the lawsuit, writing in court documents that state law did not include a mechanism to change gender on birth certificates and that the documents “record the sex of a child as reported at birth ... Ohio birth certificates do not record gender identity, and plaintiffs have no constitutional right to change their birth certificates in the manner they request.”


  Watson earlier denied a motion by the state to dismiss the case, noting that Ohio allows gender changes on driver’s licenses and official identification cards and that names can be changed on birth certificates.


  “Each plaintiff here has changed their name and sex on their Ohio driver’s license or state identification card and in their Social Security records, as well as taken steps to bring their body and gender expression into conformity with their gender identity,” the judge wrote.


  And the state allowed gender changes on birth certificates in past years, “if the transgender individuals obtained a court order, paid a processing fee and completed” a state health department form, Watson wrote in his decision Wednesday. At least 10 transgender people made sex marker corrections to their birth certificates before 2016.


  State health officials changed the birth certificate policy four years ago, however, and decided to block further changes sought by transgender residents. Name changes and alterations in cases “where the physician observed atypical genitalia and records the sex as ‘u’ for ‘undetermined’ at birth” were still allowed, according to documents.


  In his ruling Wednesday, Watson found that state policy on birth certificate changes “treats transgendered people differently than similarly situated Ohioans.”


  He added, “… the idea that the state of Ohio has a true interest in maintaining historically accurate records is undermined by the fact that Ohio permitted transgender people to change the sex marker on their birth certificates until 2016. Defendants have offered no evidence to explain why ‘historical accuracy’ has only recently become a state interest or why it was necessary to change its policy to further that interest.”

Access to accurate IDs is personally meaningful for trans folks but also practical, ensuring we can travel, apply for jobs, and enter public establishments with less risk of harassment or harm. But this update is not just about us, it’s a sensible solution for the federal government. IDs are intended to identify people, and are useless when they don’t match the applicant. Requiring trans folks to jump through hoops with doctor’s visits and medical letters to obtain updated IDs is costly, complicated, an invasion of privacy, and entirely unnecessary — and prevents many people from getting an updated ID to move through the world.
