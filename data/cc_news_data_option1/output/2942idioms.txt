Leeds [UK], July 25 (ANI): "I am the champion of the last five matches," said Tottenham Hotspur manager Jose Mourinho, while trying to explain that his tenure with the side has not been as bad as people are making it out to be.   Former Chelsea and Manchester United manager Mourinho had replaced Mauricio Pochettino as head coach of Tottenham in November last year.   The side has shown glimpses of form under Mourinho, but it has failed to secure a top-four spot in the Premier League standings.   "If you think I need to show my worth, okay, im going to try. If this is about individuals and an individual approach, lets go for an easy one. I'm fourth in the league since arriving. I arrived 14th, eight points from Arsenal, 12 from a Champions League position. But if the league starts only for me, if you want to go in that direction, I'm fourth in the league," Goal.com quoted Mourinho as saying.   "If you think that's bad, that's your opinion. If you want to laugh with me, I'm the champion of the last five matches," he added.   Tottenham has managed to secure 13 points from their last five matches.   "I try to do my best all the time, I'm not worried about proving anything. My most important match is the next one, the most important season is the next one. It's not what you think, anything that can come from outside, that can motivate me more or less. It's just my nature; I don't need that. I look forward to next season," Mourinho said.   In their last match, Tottenham defeated Leicester City 3-0 to rise to the seventh place in the Premier League standings.   Tottenham currently has 58 points from 37 matches and it will take on Crystal Palace in their final league game on Sunday, July 26. (ANI)

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has visited a national cemetery and handed out commemorative pistols to army officers, state media reported Monday, as he pushes to muster public support for efforts to contain a potential coronavirus outbreak. On Sunday, North Korea said that Kim had put a city near the border with South Korea under lockdown and declared a state of emergency after a person with suspected COVID-19 symptoms was recently found there. If the person is diagnosed with the coronavirus, it would be North Korea's first officially confirmed case, though many outside experts believe the virus has already spread to the country. The North's official Korean Central News Agency reported that Kim visited a cemetery on the outskirts of Pyongyang where Korean War dead are buried to mark the 67th anniversary of the end of the 1950-53 war. Kim laid a single rose and bowed before a big monument at the Fatherland Liberation War Martyrs Cemetery, according to KCNA. It didn’t say exactly when Kim went there. A 1953 armistice that ended the war has yet to be replaced with a peace treaty, leaving the Korean Peninsula in a technical state of war. North Korea considers the armistice signing as a victory and often uses the anniversary as a chance to promote nationalism. KCNA also reported that Kim gave “Paektusan” commemorative pistols, named after the sacred peak on the peninsula, to senior military officials during a ceremony Sunday marking the war anniversary. State media photos showed a beaming Kim, clad in his trademark dark suit, sitting while surrounded by army officers holding black pistols. “The participants held high the pistols and made firm pledges to fight for Kim Jong Un at the cost of their lives,” KCNA reported. Kim is in need of stronger internal unity as he struggles to...

BEIJING (AP) — Major Asian stock markets declined and gold surged to a record price Monday amid U.S.-China tensions and concern a recovery from the coronavirus pandemic might be weakening. Shanghai, Tokyo and Hong Kong retreated while Seoul advanced. India opened lower and Southeast Asian markets were mixed. Wall Street ended last week down after a new diplomatic flare-up between Washington and Beijing and mixed earnings reports. Global markets have regained most of this year’s losses but forecasters warn the rebound might be too big and too early as virus case numbers rise in the United States and some other economies. Weak stock prices “speak volumes of soured risk appetite amid escalating U.S.-China risks, worsening virus outbreaks and a flagging recovery,” said Hayaki Narita of Mizuho Bank in a report. The Shanghai Composite Index sank 0.4% to 3,181.15 and the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo lost 0.2% to 22,695.06. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong retreated 0.6% to 25,549.57. The Kospi in Seoul advanced 0.8% to 2,217.16 and Australia’s S&P-ASX 200 gained 0.1% to 6,032.00. India’s Sensex opened down 0.5% at 37,926.24. New Zealand and Singapore declined while Jakarta rose. Gold jumped $30.40 to a record $1927.90 per ounce in a sign investors were looking for safe havens to park money. On Friday, Wall Street’s benchmark S&P 500 index lost 0.6% to 3,215.63. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.7%, to 26,469.89. The Nasdaq composite fell 98.24 points, or 0.9%, to 10,363.18. Investors were rattled by the latest U.S.-Chinese diplomatic feud.

However, the series works pretty well. The first episode does some requisite world-building with the world of the Fey, so much so that it could almost have just been a series about Nimue and her life there and worked just as well, but it quickly adds tension and drama. Purists will complain because they have nothing better to do when it comes to the series' decision to take a colour- blind approach to some of the casting choices. But when everyone here is doing a good job with their performances, with Shalom Bruce-Franklin making an instant impression as Morgana, you would like to think that any complaints would be few and far between.<br

Taffy had owned and run two separate brokerages for nearly 30 years, one franchised with Coldwell Banker and the other with Century 21. He wanted to shift his focus from recruiting all agents, to focusing on full-time top performers and, after looking at many options, decided RE/MAX was the way to go. As Taffy said once totally immersed in his new venture, "RE/MAX was my competition for many years, but now I know why they always win." He is putting an entirely new energy into growth and has a high-performance focus by the re-invention of his company into the newly transitioned RE/MAX Olympic offices and is very optimistic about his future direction.

I don't expect everyone in the military to have unadulterated love for Donald Trump. In fact, I'd hate it: If that were the case, this wouldn't be America, where one of our core values is diversity of opinion. Eventually, however, the president is the commander in chief, the man whom every person in the military reports to at some level. Yes, that level is far more distal than any service member's relationship with an immediate commanding officer, but that doesn't any sailor, soldier, airman or any other individual can stop a car in the middle of traffic and throw both middle fingers up in the air at either one.
