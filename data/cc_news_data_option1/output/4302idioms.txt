Rappoport’s analysis is spot on, and goes into great detail about the unscientific and asinine methods used to attempt to hide the truth in a lie. _The CDC article_ in question was discovered by Sally Fallon Morrell. Her co- author, Dr. Cowen, exposes the fraud in his article titled: "Only Poisoned Monkey Kidney Cells 'Grew' the 'Virus'." The entire process was a scam, just like the virus is a scam. Of course, none of this is about any deadly virus; it is only about using a make-believe virus as an instrument of fear in order to gain mass compliance so as to achieve the total submission of billions of people. In that light, this entire episode in the U.S. could be classified as a false flag operation, but instead of attempting to use misplaced terror to go to war against another country, this war sought will be against the citizens of America and the world.

Elizabeth "Betty" Ricci Binghamton - Elizabeth "Betty" C. (Ciolek) Ricci, age 90, went to be with the Lord on October 23, 2020. Betty was born in Utica, NY, the youngest of four children. She graduated from Whitesboro H.S. and from Utica College of Syracuse University with a degree in Secretarial Science. She worked for General Electric in Utica for several years where she met her future husband Basil. At that time Betty enjoyed golfing, bowling, skiing and travelling. After getting married to Basil in 1963 and relocating to Binghamton she stopped working to become a full time mother for their six children. During retirement Betty and Basil enjoyed traveling, including trips to Austria, Italy and Hawaii. Betty was a long time member of St Andrew's and Saints John and Andrew Parish where she had the opportunity of traveling to holy sites in Poland and to the Vatican. She was a member of the St. Andrew's Altar Society. Betty was also known to frequent the local bingo halls with her close friend Justina. Family gatherings were among her favorite venues, surrounded by loved ones and even enjoying an occasional Manhattan. Betty will always be remembered as a kind, nurturing, loving wife, mother, and grandmother. She put her family first before herself in all cases. Basil would jokingly state he'll be sending her name to the Pope. She was a fantastic cook with many meals made from scratch. Entering her house you would be greeted with a smile and asked how's your day, are you hungry, did you eat? This was the case even in the midst of dementia. Betty loved to converse with people and very interested in their various situations, family, and travels. She would always greet you with a smile, never held a grudge, spoke from the heart, and felt there was something good in everyone. Betty is pre-deceased by her husband Basil E. Ricci, father and mother Thomas and Frances (Skrok) Ciolek, her sisters and brothers in-law Stella and John Wastowicz, Nora and Howard Devoe, and brother and sister in-law Stanley and Loretta Ciolek, brother and sister in-laws John and Marion Ricci, and Hilda and Adolph Ricci. Betty is survived by her children and their spouses, John and Lisa Ricci, Paul and Lacy Ricci, Tom and Amy Ricci, all of Binghamton; Ruth and Michael Stutts of Chapel Hill, NC; Kate and Andrew Mierzwa of Burbank, CA; and James and Angela Ricci of Buffalo, NY. Betty had 12 wonderful grandchildren, Alyssa, Daniella, Leanna, Dominic, Gianna, Thomas, Isabella, Vivianna, John, Genevieve, Julia, and Grant Ricci, and Aaron Stutts. Betty was also survived by many nieces and nephews, and a life-long friend and sorority sister, Virginia. The family would like to thank the wonderful nurses and staff at The Hearth at Castle Gardens/Keepsake Village and Elizabeth Church Manor, all for caring for and comforting Betty and her family throughout such a difficult ordeal. A Funeral Mass will be offered at the Church of Saints John and Andrew, Vestal Ave, Binghamton, Tuesday October 27th at 11 a.m. Burial will follow in Calvary Cemetery, Johnson City. The family will receive friends at the Church of Saints John and Andrew, Tuesday from 10 am to 11 a.m. In lieu of flowers please consider a donation to Birthright of Binghamton, 435 Main St Suite 126, Johnson City, New York, 13790.

“I couldn’t tell what was wrong with it, but it acted like its wing was broken or something,” Williams recalled.
 Two days later Williams discovered the owl in his yard again, this time during the daylight. He contacted a local game warden, who suggested he reach out to Beverly Grage of Lindale.
 Grage is a Smith County wildlife rehabilitator permitted by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. Grage has been caring for small mammals and raptors, including owls, eagles, hawks, falcons and vultures for 30 years. She calls her outfit “Wild and Free Again.”
 Grage agreed to take bird, but told Williams he would need to capture it first. He enlisted his wife, Lana, to help tackle the task.
 “It was just standing on the ground looking at us,” he said. “Lana approached from the front to keep it distracted and I slipped up from behind and threw towel over it. The owl didn’t do much, but I wore oven mitts just in case. I didn’t want it to bite me or get me with those claws.”
 The couple placed the owl in a portable dog kennel and turned it over to Grage. Sadly, the bird died roughly 12 hours after the transfer.
 In addition to a busted wing, Grage said she believes the owl had internal injuries from colliding with the truck. Trauma and stress associated with the necessary handling of the bird likely pushed the process along.
 “It happens,” Grage said. “Sometimes there just isn’t anything that can be done.”
 It might seem odd to hear about such a graceful bird of prey getting pummeled by a pick-up, but Grage says it happens more frequently than some might think.
 “Barred owls are probably the most common bird I get, but I also get quite few great horned owls, screech owls and gobs of Red-tailed hawks,” she said. “The most
 common cause of injury with the barred owls is getting hit by automobiles. Momma doesn’t do a very good job of teaching them to look both ways before crossing the road. When they are so focused on their prey and get whacked by a car it’s usually a full-body slam. What we see on the outside is usually just a small portion of the injuries they sustain when they get broad-sided by a car.”
 Grage shared a compelling tale about an adult Red-tailed hawk she’s been tending at her facility over the last week. The bird was recovered by a motorist who found it in the ditch beside an area highway.
 It was originally believed that the bird had been hit by a car, but Grage doesn’t think so.
 “The lady who found it said it was standing in the road and the car in front of her ran right over the top of it,” Grage said. “I don’t think the car actually hit the bird. My thought is the turbulence of the car passing over the top of the bird tumbled it to the side of the road. It seemed pretty rattled when I first saw it. You’ve got to remember we’re talking about a two- pound bird getting passed over by a car running 60 m.p.h.”
 Grage found no apparent injuries to the bird until she discovered blood on her hand. Closer inspection revealed a small puncture wound on one of its wings. The hole didn’t make full penetration. She believes the bird had been shot, possibly by a pellet gun.
 “Wild animals have a truly hard life out there,” Grage said. “Sometimes I think people and the automobiles can be worse enemies than their natural predators.”

 # Keeley Leising returns to assist Kent Roosevelt soccer program
 Tom Nader
 Special to The Record-Courier
 The tone of Keeley Leising’s voice resonates.
 There is passion.
 The love she has for soccer has flourished from an impact that exceeds goals scored or matches won.
 There is a delicate confidence.
 She has absorbed the game through her days as a player. She has studied. She has listened and learned so that she can be prepared.
 There is fearlessness.
 Soccer creates her comfort zone, but she is not afraid to go outside it to find her next challenge.
 As a senior at Winthrop University (S.C.), after being recruited from Kent Roosevelt as a forward, Leising stepped up to learn an entirely new position as a defender because it was what her team needed.
 She trusted her passion, confidence and fearlessness.
 She trusted in herself.
 All of the same reasons why she said, “Yes,” when Garyn Daniels called her with an opportunity to return to her alma mater to join his Rough Riders (5-6-3) boys soccer coaching staff for the 2020 season.
 It was not that coaching was new to Leising, who graduated from Winthrop last May with a degree in exercise science and minor in coaching, but coaching a boys team would be a new experience.
 A new opportunity to learn from an experience that had come unexpectedly.
 “It was not my initial plan,” Leising said. “I was planning to go to grad school and look into coaching opportunities in college, but when the pandemic hit, I decided to come home to Kent to reevaluate things. That is when Garyn reached out to me and the more I thought about it, the more I wanted to stick around. I am so happy I did, too, because things could not have worked out any better.
 Just as Daniels thought that it would.
 “Several years ago, before coming to the high school, I had the privilege to meet Keeley at an open field during the summer,” Daniels said. “She came out a few times and you could just tell her soccer IQ was off the charts. The last couple of years, we have followed each other, and I knew she was doing some coaching of her own down south and I wanted to bring her on board. I knew her knowledge of the game, as well as being a Division I college player, would provide great insight for the boys — as well as myself.”
 Daniels put Leising, whose high school career ended with All-Ohio status, in charge of rebuilding a young back line.
 To do it, Leising has followed a coaching philosophy focused on guided learning and positivity.
 “I like to try to keep things positive,” Leising said. “I think it is one of the most helpful ways for kids to learn. And I think I have almost always known that I have wanted to pursue a profession in sports. At one point, when I was young, I dreamed I would play for the women’s national team, but those are not the opportunities for everyone. I’ve had great coaches, coaches that made soccer fun for me. Now I feel like it is my turn to grow the game and give back to the game that has given so much to me.”
 Leising was recently selected — from a pool of 550 applicants — as part of the United Soccer Coaches class of 30 Coaches Under 30, which is a year-long education and mentorship program designed to support up-and-coming coaches across the country.
 An honor that resonates just like Leising.

He said, 'Just keep it going, the guys are fine with just rotating it.'
 "It doesn't put the pressure on any one guy to step up into that position, but everybody's held accountable that way. I wouldn't say that we could do that with last year's team or even next year's team, but for this year, I think it works really well.

When his cell phone is snatched by a young thief, Sundaram plunges after him, into a truly vile slum, in the vain hope that he will be able to buy the phone (with its addresses and numbers) back. On another occasion, heading off in a communal taxi to deposit his U.S. dollars in a bank, he is robbed at gunpoint by his fellow passengers. Enraged, but still innocent, Sundaram brings his complaint to a police station; believing, somehow, that the police will recover his money. They won't even look, he learns, without a substantial bribe to prime the pump. If Sundaram was lacking in cynicism at that stage in his career as a reporter, he makes no excuses; and it lends a fresh and charming candor to his writing.

Now the majority of Britain's 10,000 cystic fibrosis patients can truly plan for a future – one less blighted by hospital visits, endless rounds of antibiotics and other powerful drugs that cause horrific side effects.
 And also a future less overshadowed by the threat of Covid-19. The infection is thought to be particularly severe for those with illnesses that affect breathing. Kaftrio brings about a dramatic improvement in lung function, which should theoretically give patients more of a fighting chance against the virus.
 Anthony, who lives with partner Kathryn, 30, a civil engineer, received his first packs of Kaftrio three weeks ago by post, and began taking the pills immediately.
 'Within a few hours of the first dose, I felt different,' he says.
 Cystic fibrosis causes a wide range of symptoms, but patients usually develop thick sticky mucus in the lungs, digestive system and other organs. In the lungs, in particular, this increases the risk of infections, and patients can become severely unwell from a simple cold.
 A large part of managing the disease involves taking medications to help loosen mucus in the airways, alongside physiotherapy exercises aimed at helping cough it up.
 Kaftrio works by correcting the fault in cells that causes the thick mucus, making it thin out and more like the mucus in a healthy person. The effect is dramatic.
 'I immediately started coughing up phlegm – normally it's a struggle, and I go red in the face, but it was really loose and seemed to be coming out of its own accord,' says Anthony.
 'This just carried on all day, and then all night – people with cystic fibrosis who take the drug are calling it 'the purge'. I was bringing up stuff that had been down there for a while. Now I don't really cough, and when I do it's just like I'm clearing my throat.
 'I used to be so loud when I coughed, I'd make Kathryn jump.'
 He has already begun to reduce or stop taking other medications he's on – including the one that triggered his diabetes. And, most remarkably, Anthony's lung function has leapt to 72 per cent.
 'It's not been this good since 2016,' he adds. 'To be honest, it's hard to get my head round it. I used to wake up coughing all night, but now I'm sleeping better and I wake up with energy. It's not a cure, but I feel like my body has been rewound.
 'I feel the same as I did when I was 25. I feel like a normal person. My panic attacks have stopped. I've even been able to go jogging.'
 He takes another deep breath.
 'When I tried to breathe in before, it was like someone was squeezing my chest, stopping me. That's gone.'
 I also speak to 29-year-old Laura Gayton, another cystic fibrosis patient whose story we featured earlier this year.
 She had been shielding since the start of the pandemic. With her lung function deteriorating rapidly, an illness such as Covid-19 could be catastrophic.
 Last time I heard from her, she'd just returned home from hospital where she was having treatment for a persistent lung infection.
 Laura, who lives with firefighter husband Nicholas, 32, started on Kaftrio a month ago, and within a week her lung function had leapt from about 55 per cent to 81 per cent.
 'Before this, I was in hospital up to eight times a year,' she says. 'The last time I saw my consultant, a few weeks back, she joked that I wouldn't need to come back for six years.
 'I'm turning 30 in November, and they said I'd never live this long. I feel a bit tired, which I was warned would be a side effect, but I can breathe. It's incredible that three pills a day can do this.'
 And when we last heard from cystic fibrosis sufferer Tim Wotton, 49, he had just returned to his London home, in early August, after moving to Southampton to shield with his retired nurse mother.
 The father-of-one lived there for more than four months.Tim, who started on Kaftrio at the start of September, says he began to feel the effects just 20 minutes after taking his first tablets.
 He says: 'At my age, I live with lots of lung damage – my best days were most healthy people's worst days.
 'The first week or so were difficult, as I was constantly coughing up phlegm, even at night. But now I'm hardly producing any mucus, which is a revelation.
 'Before, I'd cough for the first two hours of the day like a 40-a-day smoker, despite the fact I've never touched a cigarette. Now I've been able to run further and push myself more in the gym.
 I feel like I'm getting fitter. Earlier this month, my 13-year-old son Felix came back from school with a cold, and I caught it.
 'We had Covid tests, and quarantined until they came back negative. I had a fever, but recovered remarkably quickly. And now I feel back to normal again.
 'It feels like Kaftrio has given me some armour plating.'
 Anthony Usher admits he can't shake the feeling that it's all too good to be true. 'It's scary. I've lived with this worry hanging over my head,' he says.
 'I keep thinking, where's the catch? I'm trying not to dwell on that, and just enjoy it. Kathryn and I are making plans. We want to go on holiday. Maybe we'll try for a family. Before, it felt like that was out of the question, but now…'
 He also can't help thinking of Elliott. 'I just wish he could have had this. And all the others who died. They might still be here.'
 On Kathryn's birthday last month, the couple and a few friends went to the Otterspool Promenade, a spot overlooking the Mersey that Elliott loved – and released balloons in his memory.
 'We'd go to the Prom as kids, and sit and watch the planes go past, and talk for hours about what I don't know,' says Anthony.
 'When we released the balloons, we thought they'd float off into the distance over the river, but the wind blew them back on to the grass behind us, and we had to chase them. I know if Elli had been there, he'd have been crying his eyes out laughing.
 'Everything seems overwhelming at the moment. But I'll be forever grateful for this drug. It's a turning point. I'm on a high. I feel like I've got my life ahead of me.'

Halloween is Janet Barron's favorite holiday, and she isn't even that big of a fan of sugar.
   
 That might not be too surprising, except that Barron is an Austin baker and culinary teacher who recently competed as a sugar artist on the 10th season of Food Network's "Halloween Wars."
   
 Barron was part of a three-person team that made elaborate and spooky sugar sculptures as they competed for a $50,000 prize. Her team didn't win the competition, but looking back on the past decade, the experience added another layer of confidence on Barron's journey from medical school dropout to bakery business owner.
   
 Eleven years ago, Barron says, she was a stay-at-home mom with two kids in an abusive marriage that took her years to leave. She was watching TV one day, and a culinary show caught her eye.
   
 "I saw a chef on the Food Network blowing a swordfish out of sugar," she says. "I was like, 'I want to do that.' "
   
 That chef was Ewald Notter, one of the world's top confection artists. Barron started enrolling in pastry and sugar classes, and Notter ended up teaching one of Barron's first classes on pulling sugar, a technique in which you heat sugar and blow and pull it like glass.
   
 "He asked me how long I had been pulling sugar. I had just started, but he said it looked like I'd been doing it for five years," she says.
   
 Her then-husband wasn't supportive of her new interest, but that positive comment from an esteemed teacher stuck in her mind.
   
 "All it takes is one or two people to believe in you," Barron says.
   
 She continued to attend sugar arts classes and conferences and eventually started competing at them, often placing or winning categories, which further boosted her confidence.
   
 "Sugar is the hardest medium to learn," she says. "It's a million times harder than it looks."
   
 After she got up the courage to leave her husband, they spent many years in a long legal battle over their children. The post-divorce drama left her exhausted and suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, she says. She felt as if she had no power. She was homeless for a while and then lived above a friend's garage.
   
 Barron credits the difficulty of working with sugar in helping her stop thinking so much about the other problems in her life.
   
 "With sugar work, it's so dangerous. You're boiling sugar to 380 degrees. You concentrate on that, and you don't concentrate on your problems."
   
 While her sons were in high school, she started working as a nanny, and she used food and cooking to teach geography, math and science during the school year and in at-home summer camps.
   
 Earlier this year, her youngest son graduated from high school, which signaled the end of the multiyear custody battle and gave Barron a sense of relief that that violent chapter of her life was over. (Her sons are now both enrolled in college, where they are studying biomedicine and, fittingly, food science.)
   
 Her mission now is to share her love of pastry and a message of empowerment to any others who might find themselves in an abusive family situation.
   
 "I picked up a piping bag and started believing in myself," she says. "If I can save one woman, I want to say that you can find a job and get out. It's worth saying that."
   
 The cottage law in Texas allows bakers to sell products prepared in their home kitchens, which is one reason Barron has been able to start a business without the startup costs of a commercial kitchen or brick-and-mortar establishment.
   
 Through her company, Barron's Bakery, she sells custom baked goods and treats, but her favorite thing to do is teach kids' cooking classes. She's taught adults of all ages, from bachelorettes to senior citizens, but the young cooks have the most creativity when she pulls out a piping bag.
   
 "I love pastry as much as I love kids," she says.
   
 Many of the kids she has taught and nannied over the years joined her for a socially distanced party to celebrate the premiere of "Halloween Wars" in September.
   
 It was a celebration that marked more than Barron's debut on national television.
   
 Barron says that when Food Network producers called her to ask if she wanted to compete on "Halloween Wars," she wanted to share both her skills and her story about leaving an abusive marriage with a national audience.
   
 "If I walked away with anything, it was new friendships. But I also learned how to trust myself in new ways," she says. "Teamwork is very important, but I also learned how to use my voice."
   
 The show was also a chance for her to claim her expertise.
   
 "I used to be known as a stay-at-home mom at these things, and they'd call me Susie Homemaker, but now they call me chef."
   
 Halloween decorating ideas
   
 At a recent Halloween decorating session with some of the kids she nannies, Barron worked with the kids and their parents to make one-eyed, one-horned purple people eater cupcakes, a Frankenstein cake and a zombie unicorn. She shared some tips and ideas if you want to get creative at home this weekend.
   
 • To make the Frankenstein cake, take a rectangle cake and cover it with buttercream icing and then spray with green edible paint. (Wilton's makes one that is available at Make it Sweet and other crafting and baking supply stores.) Use a Wilton 48 tip, which is flat with a lined edge, to make the lines of hair and the mouth with buttercream tinted black with a gel-based food dye. The "bolts" are made from marshmallows coated in melted white chocolate peels and then rolled in silver sprinkles.
   
 • To make a mummy cake, use an even flatter tip, such as a 1D, to make strips of white buttercream across your cupcake or cake surface. If you'd rather work with fondant, you can cut strips of "gauze" to wrap around the cake. (Use a little buttercream on the back of the fondant to make it stick. Water helps fondant stick to itself, if you're going to get creative with it.)
   
 • If you have some higher-level cake decorating skills, you could make a zombie-inspired green unicorn with gray or black hair.
   
 • You can use waffle ice cream cones to make a unicorn horn or witches' hats. To make the hat, Barron slices off the end of the cone and then re-attaches it at an angle to make the fold of the hat. She then coats the cone in melted chocolate and dusts the outside in black or purple sprinkles.
   
 • One of the most useful decorating materials is melting chocolate, or chocolate peels, which you don't have to temper and can be used to coat cookies, pretzels, ice cream cones or whatever else needs a thin layer of chocolate. Once you've dipped or drizzled the melting chocolate, you can decorate with sprinkles, jimmies or any kind of edible decoration. (NeonYolk.com is an Austin-based sprinkle company that sells festive sprinkle mixes for all seasons.)
   
 • Make it Sweet in North Austin has edible candy eyeballs, and you can also draw them with an edible marker, such as those made by Gourmet Writer.
   
 • If you want to make fake glass for a scary Halloween project, boil sugar to hard stage (295 to 309 degrees) and then pour onto a silicon-lined baking tray. Let cook and then crack.
   
 • Barron uses Karo or corn syrup mixed with red food coloring to make the "blood." To get the consistency right, she heats corn syrup and food coloring and then sifts in a little cornstarch at a time to thicken it slightly. She pours it into a squeezable plastic bottle so she can drizzle on her project.
   
 • Barron didn't make one for this session, but she says haunted gingerbread houses are a fun group activity that you can make using whatever candies and decorations you already have.
   
 • With egg whites, sugar and cream of tartar, you can make meringue ghosts to put on top of a cupcake or to live in your haunted house.
