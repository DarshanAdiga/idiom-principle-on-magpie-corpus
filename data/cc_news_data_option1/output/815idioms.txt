Evan Fournier ($17.2 million) could also see a nice raise or at least an incremental one. There should be suitors for him despite the dry market. His playmaking and scoring ability gives him a rotation spot on just about every team with or without cap space. He should be considered an extension candidate ahead of free agency as he currently can extend with the Magic for up to a maximum of $92.2 million between 2020-21 and 2023-24. If he opts out and is not offered long-term security, he could probably still earn more than $17.2 million on a one-year deal. Whether he opts out or not, he’s in an excellent position heading into the offseason because of his options.

New Delhi [India], Feb 28 (ANI): Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Friday said that the Balakot airstrike carried out by the Indian Air Force had sent a clear message that it was not safe anymore for the terrorists to continue using areas "beyond Line of Control (LoC) and International Border (IB)" for anti-India activities.   "Balakot reflected our approach against the employment of terrorism as a low- cost option against India. It also indicated that terrorists, terrorist infrastructure and terrorist training facilities in areas beyond LoC and International Border when employed against India, will no longer be safe haven," Singh said at the Centre for Air Power Studies in New Delhi.   "It was made amply clear that terrorism will not remain a low-cost option that can proliferate under veiled threats and bogeys that have repeatedly been voiced by irresponsible and ill-informed leaders from across the border," he added.   The Defence Minister further said that the Balakot airstrike had led to changes in the perception of India in the minds of our neighbours.   "I have little doubt that Balakot strike forced the rewriting of many a manual and rule book across the LoC. Those who preferred to place India in an imaginary understanding of the past were brought into the reality of the present and its potential manifestation in the future," Singh said.   Hailing the operation, Singh added, "Balakot will continue to reiterate India's intent to employ the most appropriate resources for the intended impact, with an element of unpredictability and innovation as an integral part of the endeavour. It is this factor that must remain uppermost in our minds."   On the one year anniversary of the airstrike, Singh also thanked all partners and friends across the globe for recognising the "challenge posed by terrorism to be greater than narrow parochial pronouncements".   Further speaking about the way forward, the Defence Minister said that India had adopted some big structural changes to "tackle threats to our nation", and urged all stakeholders to contribute in making the changes effective.   "We have initiated some major structural changes in the way we intend tackling threats to our nation. It will take some time for the entire set up to be fully operational. This transition time is crucial and we need to keep the guard up," Singh said.   "All stakeholders need to contribute to making these changes effective and efficient. Of course, there will be some teething problems in the initial days. We need to be ready for these and use our professional knowledge to find suitable and effective solutions," he added.   On Wednesday, Chief of Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria flew a sortie in MiG-21 of 51 Squadron with two Mirage-2000s and Sukhoi-30MKI from Srinagar airbase to mark the completion of one year of Balakot airstrike.   Last year, the Indian Air Force had carried out an airstrike in Pakistan's Balakot, targetting Jaish-e-Muhammed's (JeM) terror training camps in response to a terror attck on a CRPF convoy in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama in which at least 40 personnel were killed.

So I then spent over an hour with a mop, bucket, bottle of Clorox, rubber gloves and elbow grease. None of those things are considered part of the technology of today’s world! In fact it doesn’t even take a lot of thinking or brains, just brawn. It is a necessary part of taking care of a calf in the house though. We did all this without turning on our phones or checking our computers. The basement floor is clean and ready in case of another cow/calf emergency. And the calf is now nursing its mom and doing well, so it wasn’t wasted effort.
 We sometimes take the simple things in life for granted and it seems with so much technology floating around, there are less and less “simple things” available for us to do. We should appreciate the fact that we can still function without technology, we can still perform daily tasks without turning something on. And maybe we need to do more of these things to keep our brain alive and functioning.
 I love the times when we are at the ranch and have no electricity. Yes, I take my laptop with me to write, and it uses battery power to function, but I can’t go online as we don’t have access to the internet so I can’t do any research. Our phones work in some areas up there but not all. We have a basic first aid kit and some basic medications for cattle in case we need to do any doctoring. We try to find a bit of “common sense” in facing problems such as break downs on equipment, broken wire on fences, and sick calves. And it seems like duct tape, baling twine, a hammer, some pliers and a pair of leather gloves can do wonders when we don’t have technology to tell us what and how to do something.
 Yes, technology has its place in our world anymore, and its place is getting bigger all of the time. But there is still a place for simple cures for getting things accomplished. Hopefully we won’t have to bring another calf into the basement this year, but we will if we have to without hesitation and without technology.

Perhaps no figure is more a part of Texas History and American folklore than Davy Crockett. In his life on the frontier and his death, he has been a hero to millions of Americans for generations.
   
 David Crockett was born in the mountains of eastern Tennessee in 1786. He was the fifth of nine children in a farming family. By the age of twelve, he was part of cattle drives from Tennessee into Virginia. He had little formal education and taught himself to read, write, and add. He became known for his quick wit and storytelling.
   
 By 1816, Crockett and his new family settled in Lawrence County, Tennessee, where Crockett farmed, hunted, and ran two mills and a distillery. He was soon elected as county commissioner and became a lieutenant colonel in the local militia unit. He was elected to the state legislature by 1821 and to Congress by 1827.
   
 He had a bitter falling out with President Andrew Jackson over federal land sales and treatment of Native American tribes. As a result, Jackson used all of his political will to destroy Crockett's political career.
   
 He lost the 1834 election to Adam Huntsman, a Jackson ally. After the bitter defeat, Crockett left for Texas in 1835, seeking the promise of new lands and a fresh start.
   
 As for Huntsman, Crockett's eldest son, John Wesley Crockett, defeated him for re-election in 1836, avenging his father's name once and for all.
   
 Crockett's time in Texas was short. Almost immediately upon his arrival, he was swept up in the excitement of the Texas Revolution as Mexico was pulled apart. He joined a volunteer unit heading to San Antonio to meet the approaching forces under Gen. Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna.
   
 Crockett reached the Alamo on February 8, 1836, and began shoring up the old mission's defenses. By February 23, the Mexican army arrived and the siege began. The defenders held out for two weeks against a heavily armed force ten times their size. Santa Anna seized the mission on March 6, and 182 defenders perished.
   
 What happened to Crockett at the fall of the Alamo has been a source of intense debate for many years. Some studies contended for years that he fought to the bitter end, never surrendering. Reports from Mexican troops contended that he was captured, and while Santa Anna's troops, impressed with his bravery, pled for Crockett's life, the bitter and vainglorious general ordered his execution anyway. Regardless, when Texas troops made their stand in that desperate siege, Crockett stood with them.
   
 In the years after his death, Crockett became a larger-than-life legend, adored by countless Americans. Numerous landmarks were named in his honor. The town of Crockett was founded near Houston in 1837. Crockett County in western Tennessee, not far from Memphis, was named for him in 1871 (with the county seat in the community of Alamo). Crockett County in West Texas was named for him in 1891. Numerous schools have been named after him, including in Austin, Dallas, and Grand Prairie. This is in addition to the Crockett National Forest and Lake Davy Crockett, both in East Texas.
   
 Many films, books, and television shows have told and re-told his tale often. Perhaps the most famous was the Walt Disney depiction on television that originally appeared in 1954 and 1955, starring Fess Parker as Crockett in a coonskin cap. American children were captivated by the wild frontiersman image of Crockett, reportedly buying millions of coonskin caps to imitate Parker's portrayal of the "King of the Wild Frontier." In modern America, the legend has become almost inseparable from the man.

The recommendation underscores how coal's status as the cheapest and easiest option for developing countries to bring power to their people is being challenged on multiple fronts as richer nations shy away from the fuel. Global banks are refusing to lend, making it more difficult and costly to build plants that burn the dirtiest fossil fuel, while costs are tumbling for competing renewable generation.
 Under the committee's proposal, coal would provide about 37 percent of Vietnam's electricity by 2025 instead of half as previously planned. Renewable power would help fill the gap, increasing to about a quarter of the country's power from 13 percent in the existing version. The share for natural gas and major hydropower plants, which comprise most of the remaining capacity, would be left little changed.
 The Vietnamese government is likely to put a greater focus on renewables in its new power development plan, which it aims to complete by June, said Daine Loh, an analyst at Fitch Solutions. Even then, threats of power shortages and the need to support economic growth mean the government will probably maintain its commitment to coal, she said.
 Vietnam is a flash point in the global debate about coal power. About 17 gigawatts of coal power is already under construction, with another 29 gigawatts at various pre-construction phases, Loh said. It has the fourth- largest pipeline of proposed plants, according to BloombergNEF, many of which have drawn financing in past years from lenders in Japan and other countries.
 Several banks in Japan, as well as South Korea and Singapore, last year joined lenders from Europe and the U.S. in limiting financing for the fuel because of concerns that climate change would mean the polluting projects would have to be shut before loans could be paid off.
 The departure of Asian lenders will likely be an inflection point in keeping new plants in places like Indonesia and Vietnam from being financed, BNEF analyst Allen Tom Abraham said in a report on Tuesday.
 Private-sector companies have proposed building about 20.3 gigawatts of coal plants in Vietnam through 2030, according to BNEF. Less than 8 gigawatts of that has reached financial close, and many of the remaining plants will never get financing, Abraham said.
 Coal also faces local opposition in light of air-quality problems throughout Asia. In early January, an alliance of social and professional organizations in Hanoi focused on health and environmental rights called for construction to be suspended for 14 coal-fired plant projects with a total capacity of 17.4 gigawatts, according to the Thanh Nien newspaper.

Broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, chard, and kale can all be started indoors all month. Kale and chard may sprout if sown outdoors, but will get a head start if started indoors for a few weeks before transplanting. Tomatoes and peppers can be sown in March. Peppers are more sensitive to cold and may need to be coddled indoors for a few weeks longer than tomatoes, but due to their slow growth, I tend to plant them both at the same time. I’ve learned my lesson starting tomatoes too early and ended up with giant plants that are a pain to manage indoors, so I tend to err on the side of “too late” and wait until mid- to late month to start tomatoes and peppers.

"He gives us a different alternative to the strengths that the other players have got in the team and I was delighted in terms of his energy and enthusiasm.
 "When he gets the ball he's positive and gets his shots away, in a very similar nature to what we can see from Danny (Johnson)."
 Striker Johnson netted his first goal for the O's in the draw with Oldham and Embleton believes this is just the start for him.
 "Danny is a goalscorer and that goal going in, people I'm sure will try to take a bit of edge off it for him, but he nudges it over the line and that's what goalscorers do," he added.
 "Danny has a real hunger to get in the box and you see a couple of times in the first half that he's trying to spin to get away from people and get his shots away.
 "I think that's what we liked about him when we watched him. It's always going to be difficult when you join a new club and you're trying to find your way into a team first and foremost, then trying to find your identity to stamp that down and keep your place.
 "Ultimately, he's got a goal, and I'm delighted for him."

Turkey has decided to no longer stop Syrian refugees from reaching Europe by land and sea, a senior Turkish official told Reuters on Thursday, in anticipation of the imminent arrival of refugees from Syria's Idlib where nearly a million have been displaced. Given the green light to seek their way to Europe, hundreds of irregular migrants on Friday came to Turkish coastal regions and border cities to do just that. Turkish officials announced earlier that they would no longer try to stop irregular migrants from reaching Europe. Turkey already hosts some 3.6 million migrants from Syria alone-more than any other country in the world - and has complained that Europe failed to keep its promises to help the migrants as well as help Turkey stem further migrant waves. Irregular migrants, including women and children, have been heading towards border villages of the country's western provinces of Edirne and Çanakkale to reach Greece. The movement started at night and grew by the morning. Irregular immigrants also moved to the regions with a coast on the Aegean Sea to cross the Greek islands. The groups also flocked towards the Aegean, to Çeşme, Karaburun and Seferihisar in the Izmir province and Kuşadası and Dikili in the Aydın province. The news also comes as attacks mount in Syria's Idlib province, with about a million refugees fleeing Assad regime attacks towards Turkey's southern borders.

PORTLAND -- The regional government that oversees three counties in the Portland metropolitan area has voted to refer a ballot measure to voters this May that would raise $250 million a year to address chronic homelessness in the region.
 The government entity, Metro, voted unanimously on Tuesday to refer two taxes to voters in Multnomah, Clackamas and Washington counties, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported Wednesday. The money would be earmarked for supportive services that target the reasons people can become homeless. Those services would include case management, rent assistance, addiction and recovery services, mental health care and employment support.
 "Failure on this is not an option," said Metro Council President Lynn Peterson. "We've waited too long, and it is now time to pay for the services that have proven to be effective in addressing the cause of chronic homelessness."
 Metro will ask voters to approve two new taxes May 19.
 The first would be a 1% marginal income tax for the wealthiest residents -- individuals earning more than $125,000 annually or couples making more than $200,000. That tax would generate $169 million a year, according to Andy Shaw, director of government affairs for Metro.
 The second tax would be a 1% business tax on the profits of mid- and large- sized businesses, those with gross receipts of more than $5 million dollars.
 Peterson's chief of staff, Paul Slyman, said the money would be distributed based on the population of each county: About 45% would go Multnomah County, 33% for Washington County, and 21% to Clackamas County. Five percent will be left over for "Metro oversight and administration."
 The Portland Business Alliance, the region's largest chamber of commerce, was opposed to the ballot measure until last week but said Tuesday it was on board.
 "We all recognize the need to provide wraparound services to stabilize our fellow residents in need," said Andrew Hoan, the business group's president. "You have our full support."

Jennifer Wexton, who represents a district in the well-to-do northern Virginia suburbs, has said she won't support Sanders on Super Tuesday. The decision came after Republicans vying for their party's nomination to unseat her suggested she sided with Sanders on key issues.
 Sanders, meanwhile, has vowed to build a “multiracial, multi-generational movement" based on appealing to working-class voters who were the backbone of his 2016 campaign, but also to minorities he struggled to impress while facing off with Clinton in 2016.
 His campaign says outreach to blacks and Hispanics fueled his victory in Nevada — but there's a far stiffer test in Virginia, where nearly 20% of the population is black, and Hispanics and Asians make up nearly 17%.
 Virginia also features highly distinct electorates based on geography. The Washington suburbs are where Trump backlash helped the Democrats take control of the House in 2018. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, whose views on “Medicare for All” universal health coverage and tuition-free college are as progressive as Sanders', drew thousands to a recent rally in Arlington. But Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, then staged his own rally nearby that also attracted thousands, and another moderate, Biden, has used the area for frequent fundraisers.
 Other parts of the state are more rural and tend to be more conservative — though there's also a left-leaning libertarian streak that Sanders could exploit.
 Sanders stopped Thursday in Richmond — the state capital and onetime capital of the Confederacy —- and is holding a rally on Saturday afternoon in Springfield, just outside the Beltway and home to a fast-expanding Hispanic population, before heading to Virginia Beach.
 Yaheiry Mora, director of CASA in Action, which has endorsed Sanders and identifies itself as the largest electoral organization advocating for immigrant and Latino rights in the Mid-Atlantic, will have volunteers canvassing on the senator's behalf in Woodbridge and Annandale, Virginia, on Saturday, close to Sanders’ Springfield rally. She said those knocking on doors find that the senator's support for Medicare for All, ending the Trump administration’s tough immigration policies and raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour resonates with voters of color.
 “All over the state, we have folks that are undecided. They express, ‘I love Bernie, but I just don’t know where I can beat Trump,’ and that’s where I think our persuasion message has been working,” Mora said. “We focus on those three areas and it helps.”
 At Sanders' Richmond rally, insurance agent Nicole Long said that Virginia voters are worried more about their future than the last time the senator was on the ballot and that they are now more open to the “radical change” he's offering. Still, she acknowledged he's facing an uphill fight in the state.
 “I'm hopeful but hesitant,” she said.

KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) — She wakes every day long before dawn to chat with her three stranded daughters on the other side of the world in China's locked-down city of Wuhan, anxious to see they have started a new day virus-free. “If I don’t get a reply it worries me, but if I get a reply from any of them I say, ‘’Thank you, Jesus,'\" Margaret Ntale said. Many countries evacuated citizens from Wuhan after the virus outbreak started there, but thousands of students from African countries have been left behind. Despite pleas with governments for evacuation, several African countries have said it's safer to stay in place. More than 4,000 African students have been estimated to be in Wuhan, a result of China's push to expand its influence on the youthful African continent. Bringing them home, governments say, is risky in sub-Saharan Africa, which on Friday confirmed its first case of the virus, in Nigeria's city of Lagos. Just two cases have been confirmed in North Africa, in Egypt and Algeria. Health systems can be weak, and quarantining dozens or hundreds of returning people is a major challenge. That leaves African students stuck on ever-emptier campuses in Wuhan, worrying about running out of food or the money to buy it. Some governments have begun sending thousands of dollars to help them get by. “I have a few friends who are not able to get things like detergent, sanitary towels, and then also not having food, like such things like that,\" said one of Ntale's daughters' roommates, Joanna Aloyo, via a messaging app. On Thursday, Ntale joined other parents in Uganda's capital, Kampala, to talk to local reporters about their fears.

TRENTON -- Gov. Phil Murphy may not have singled it out in his budget speech to lawmakers Tuesday, but his proposed state budget could bring send some additional funds to dozens of New Jersey towns.
   
 Murphy's 2021 fiscal year spending plan calls for the restoration of some of the municipal aid awarded to towns with large amounts of state- and nonprofit preserved land that was cut a decade ago by Republican Chris Christie.
   
 The state aid, called Open Space Payments in Lieu of Taxes or PILOT, has been distributed to municipalities since the early 1970s in order to help compensate for the loss of taxable land. The money is supposed to be awarded by formula based on a town's acreage of preserved property.
   
 However, Christie slashed the program's funding by close to a third -- from $10 million to $6.5 million -- in fiscal year 2011 to help close a budget deficit. Since then it's remained frozen at the 2011 level.
   
 Impacted towns have lobbied for years for the governor and Legislature to restore the lost funding, arguing that the loss was devastating to the finances of many small, rural towns, like Bass River and Woodland in Burlington County, that have small tax bases and no way of growing revenue save for raising the property taxes on their homeowners.
   
 Murphy's plan calls for the PILOT funds to be restored to the $10 million total distributed in 2009. The $3.5 million increase amounts to just over 0.008% of the budget's $40.8 billion in spending, but local officials said the dollars could have a big impact on some local towns.
   
 "It's a big deal," said Woodbine Mayor William Pikolycky, who also chairs the Pinelands Municipal Council.
   
 The organization represents the 53 municipalities located within the protected Pinelands Reserve and was among the biggest proponents for restoring the funding.
   
 A total of 150 municipalities across the state would see additional aid, which would mirror the sums they received in fiscal year 2010. The awards are not expected to reflect any additional acres of land that was preserved in a town since then, according to municipal officials.
   
 Ten Burlington County municipalities would receive more aid: Bass River, Bordentown Township, Cinnaminson, Medford, Pemberton Township, Shamong, Southampton, Tabernacle, Washington Township and Woodland.
   
 Among those, some of the additional money will be insignificant. Bordentown Township's PILOT money should increase just $1,778 to $5,336. But for some of the others, the increases could have impact.
   
 Bass River should receive $240,737, amounting to an $80,246 increase. Woodland's PILOT should increase $243,457 to $730,371, and Washington Township should receive $365,631 more, returning its total PILOT to just over $1.09 million.
   
 "For a small town like us, it's huge," Bass River Mayor Deborah Buzby-Cope said Wednesday.
   
 "We've been fighting for 10 years for this," Buzby-Cope said, adding that she spoke to Murphy personally about the issue. "Ten years is a long time, but it's perseverance."
   
 The small southern Burlington County town's total budget last year was just over $2.1 million and included a $350,000 debt payment that contributed to the largest property tax hike in Burlington County.
   
 The total tax bill on the average assessed property in the town rose $680, from $4,662 to $5,342.
   
 Much of the Bass River's financial troubles can be traced back to the loss of state funding, which forced the town to spend down its surplus over the years in order to continue services without imposing a massive tax hike. Since so much of the town is preserved, there's no way to realistically expand its tax base.
   
 Woodland has wrestled with similar financial struggles and also passed a big tax increase last year. The total tax bill in the town rose $625 to $6,460.
   
 "The (FY 2011 cut) hurt us badly and Mayor (William) DeGroff has been fighting to get this funding back," said Maryalice Brown, Woodland's longtime municipal clerk. "We just had a significant tax increase."
   
 It's too soon to tell what impact the additional revenue might have on the impacted towns' 2020 budgets and tax rates. Most are still in the middle of crafting their own spending plans.
   
 Buzby-Cope said she was at least hopeful that her town might be able to use the money to actually reduce the local property tax burden after last year's big increase. Brown said the aid might allow Woodland to begin rebuilding its budget surplus.
   
 Pikolycky said the inclusion of the funding in the governor's budget was a "big, big first start."
   
 However, he said the additional money, while extraordinarily helpful, will not make the impacted towns whole following a decade of shortfalls. The proposed state funding also does not yet reflect hundreds of additional acres preserved in some towns during the last 10 years.
   
 "This hasn't been addressed for 10 years and we want to get to 100% funding," Pikolycky said. "But at this point, I'm encouraged. We still want to sit down with the governor and members of the Legislature to talk about how to continue this program and build on it. But I give a lot of credit to the governor for recognizing the importance of this and making it a part of his budget agenda."
   
 Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club, also praised Murphy for restoring the funding, noting that the compensation is an important part of preserving open space.
   
 "We made a commitment to towns when we bought open space that we would compensate them," he said. "We preserved these lands and we do need to help these towns, so I think it's an important part of the budget."
   
 Murphy did not address the open space PILOT money during his speech but did devote significant time to his administration's efforts to address the state's notoriously high property taxes, both by encouraging shared services, reducing public employee health care costs and by significantly increasing school funding.His proposed budget calls for an additional $336 million in formula aid for school districts.
   
 "School funding is property tax relief. It is the most aggressive way we can attack the single-largest root-cause of our high property taxes," Murphy said during his speech.
   
 While the PILOT money was a welcome inclusion in the budget, Jon Moran, senior legislative analyst with the New Jersey League of Municipalities, said municipal officials remain frustrated that the state's municipal formula aid awarded to all 565 cities and towns continues to be frozen at levels
   
 "It's great that the state budget has recovered from the great recession and school aid has recovered … But most municipalities are still in that recession," Moran said.

LITTLE YORK -- Larry Eckhardt spent more than 15 years traversing much of the Midwest and beyond to honor fallen military and public-safety personnel.
 On Wednesday, "The Flagman" received a similar tribute, while he still was around to see it.
 Volunteers planted American flags for more than a mile along a route to Eckhardt's residence in Little York, located about a dozen miles northwest of Monmouth in Warren County.
 The reason for the tribute wasn't pleasant. Much like the more than 200 tributes Eckhardt has orchestrated and the almost 500,000 American flags planted at them.
 Eckhardt, who is in his early- to mid-60s, spent the past month or so in a hospital in Iowa City, Iowa. He was being treated for complications from thyroid cancer first diagnosed in late 2017. He has entered end-of-life hospice care.
 An ambulance transported Eckhardt the 85 miles from Iowa City to Little York. Hundreds of flags along Illinois Route 94 welcomed him home.
 "His mission was to have the flags for veterans and first responders," witness Cheryl Shanenga told KWQC-TV of Davenport, Iowa. "He's made a difference and we saw what he did. We appreciate him for what he did. His mission isn't over."
 That mission began after Eckhardt attended a military funeral that featured a dearth of American flags. Eckhardt, a retiree and U.S. Marine, figured he'd do something about it.
 "There's no town out there that can afford to have 2,000 flags on standby in case we need them," Eckhardt told the Journal Star a few years ago.
 That flag figure was a minimum Eckhardt estimated was necessary to line routes from funeral homes to churches or cemeteries.
 Eckhardt procured the flags, which he would haul in a van and trailer to whatever grieving community needed them. Almost spontaneously, townspeople and others would help him unload and plant, then reload post-services. They also would provide donations.
 "We come into a town where nobody knows me," Eckhardt said. "At their absolute worst time, they've lost a big part of their community, and I ask for volunteers. Boom, they're there."
 So was Eckhardt, at services from Nebraska to Ohio and from Arkansas to Minnesota.
 Under another guise, Nick in the Morning met Eckhardt in 2014. He was ferrying flags for the funeral of Reid Nannen, a Marine Corps pilot from Hopedale who was killed when his fighter plane crashed during a training exercise in Nevada.
 Indeed, dozens of volunteers gathered at the Hopedale Village Hall to help Eckhardt. And to help make sure Nannen's sacrifice wasn't trivialized.
 "We've treated our troops like a Bic lighter -- take all the fire out of them, then throw them away. Well, it's not that way anymore," Eckhardt said that day.
 "These people really do care, and the most important thing is as long as the flags are remembered -- and in a small town, they're remembered -- this young man is going to be remembered."
 The Flagman will be remembered, too. Godspeed.

Copper Futures: Rebound in the offing?


--DocBreak--
Without meaning to, the owners of Lovely, a new cafe in downtown Springfield, created a verbal trap you'll fall into again and again when describing the cafe.
 And they're not wrong -- it is a lovely place to have coffee, meet a friend or simply enjoy the atmosphere as you devour a bowl of vibrant, locally sourced food.
 People
 Husband-wife duo Sarah Adler, 31, and Josh Matthews, 32, are Springfield natives who have lived around the country and in major cities such as Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and even abroad in Berlin before returning home to raise their 1-year-old son, Zane.
 "We turned out OK, so we figured he'd be OK, too," Adler said.
 Adler's family owns Will Leather Goods and she helped design stores for the company. Matthews is a professional skateboarder. On their opening day, the pair worked in tandem and effused a calm, happy energy that shapes the homey vibe of Lovely.
 Venue
 The cafe sits on the bright corner of Main and Fourth streets, with windows along both walls. Bar stools line the side and a large table takes up the front window. Outside on the corner are benches (with more outdoor seating coming soon), and just 25 seats inside leave plenty of space to move around.
 At the back of a long, curved wooden counter capped with a fig mosaic by Matthews' sister, a nook with several two-top tables is made cozy by a record player, cookbooks and prismatic paintings by local artist and Register-Guard columnist Benjamin Terrell. Color pops in multi-hued Fiestaware and a green countertop, contrasting a black and white tile floor. Two lighting fixtures that look like copper flowers were made by Adler from antique hardware store nail bins, turned upside down and wired with bulbs.
 Through a rear doorway is a single large bathroom complete with a soundtrack of chirping birds. Wi-Fi is available, but the space begs for human, not digital, connection.
 Menu
 The menu will change several times a week as ingredients come in and out of season, said Adler and Matthews. Basic categories of bowls, toasts and snacks beg to be to customized with sweet and savory add-ons. Quality staples like toast from Hideaway Bakery are topped with pickled Deck Family Farm eggs, Oregon Lox smoked salmon and Hummingbird Wholesale organic almond butter.
 A simple selection of sweet and savory bowls includes overnight oats with fruit ($9) and dressed quinoa and kale with avocado ($9). Add-ons include avocado, chicken, sardines and colorful and crunchy pickled veggies and eggs with jammy yolks. Full snack boards include meats, olives and cheese for your munching pleasure.
 Drinks range from a green smoothie ($5) and lemon-ginger "immunity shot" ($3) to espresso ($3), lattes ($4) and drip coffee ($2) from Idaho's Push & Pour roasters. Golden chai and other teas are $2, and Coldfire beers are $6 -- rose and chianti, too.
 Vegans and vegetarians as well as meat-eaters will find something to enjoy here, with non-dairy milks, gluten-free options and hearty, nutritious animal proteins like salmon and chicken bone broth soup. Daily specials in the $5 to $9 range riff off the base menu.
 The menu's beauty is in its simplicity and quotidian elegance. This is whole food you can eat every day. Though there's food for any diet, it seems like nothing is off-limits. Kids will find plenty of simple flavors and textures to explore. Prices are rather lovely, too, with toasts $3 to $8, snacks $4 to $12 and basic bowls $9 to $12.
 Philosophy
 "To feel good when you leave" is what Lovely's owners want to convey with their food. The two said they'd become accustomed to healthy options dining out while living in large cities, but didn't find what they wanted in Springfield. So, they did it themselves.
 "We want to eat here," Adler said.
 Though some may view whole foods menus as bland, this approach uses quality in place of complexity to celebrate what's good the way it is.
 The menu is largely locally sourced, including Groundworks Farm, Deck Family Farm, Umpqua Dairy, Hummingbird Wholesale, Springfield Creamery, Bob's Red Mill, Hideaway Bakery and Benedetti's Meat Market in its purveyor list.
 Community
 The first day of business, Lovely was full of people of all ages enjoying the atmosphere and food. "That was the best avocado toast I've ever had," one said. A toddler's smeared handprint on the plate glass front window with just a dab of green seemed to suggest that someone very small liked the avocado toast that day, too.

It's been complicated by President Ashraf Ghani's insistence to hold an election last September. He wanted to give himself a mandate heading into negotiations with the Taliban.
 But critics say a divisive election has only fragmented the political landscape in Kabul. The country's election commission declared Ghani the winner earlier this month, despite charges of irregularities from his opponents and from the elections complaints commission
 U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday pleaded for Kabul to come up with a “fully representative” team for talks with the Taliban.
 Hamid Gailani, an Afghan negotiator in preliminary talks, said that “the biggest challenge that I see is the political turmoil (in Kabul), and that needs to be resolved."
 He called on the fractious leadership to think of the greater good and not to miss a rare window of opportunity. "God forbid, if we lose this opportunity, then it is gone forever,” he said.
 In 2001, many Taliban fighters returned to their communities after their government collapsed. But the new administration in Kabul sought revenge, often using the U.S.-led coalition to exact it, demanding money from former Taliban or threatening to hand them to U.S. forces.
 That drove thousands of fighters to once again take up arms and head back into the mountains, according to former Taliban members and analysts explaining their group's resurgence.
 The Taliban now control or hold sway over half the country, and are at their most powerful since the U.S. invasion.
 Only one militant group ever signed a peace agreement with Ghani's government. The group's leader, warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, said many of his fighters faced harassment, intimidation and even prison when they attempted to re- integrate.
 "We hope this failed experience is not be repeated with the Taliban,” Hekmatyar he said in an interview this week.
 At an Afghan National Army post in the capital, the AP spoke with two soldiers, including one who served for 14 years. They welcomed a peace deal with the Taliban. Neither wanted to give their name as they gestured to their torn uniforms and disintegrating army boots, fearing retribution from their commanding officers if they spoke too freely.
 One soldier said he hadn't received his salary, and the other said he received only half a month's salary.
 “We'll be happy to have the Taliban serving with us, but if the government isn't paying us, how can they pay them?” he said.
 "Maybe the Taliban should think twice before wanting to join the army.”

The role of a Republican state committeeman is to provide the crucial link between the local town committees and the GOP at the local and state levels.
 I adhere to the concept that "all politics are local," meaning the health and well-being of our grass-roots town committees are the lifeblood of our party.
 I have had the distinct opportunity to see firsthand the effective leadership of Cape & Islands Republican State Committeeman Fran Manzelli. Fran has been an active participant in the Harwich Republican Town Committee for many years. His leadership and effective communication style lend themselves to developing and growing our town committees.
 As president of the Cape Cod Republican Club, Fran has initiated a Capewide scholarship program for graduating seniors and has effectively and ably promoted the goals and ideals of the Republican Party here on Cape Cod.
 Fran Manzelli gets the job done and has my vote on March 3. I think we should stay the course and reelect Fran Manzelli as Republican state committeeman.

In non-government jobs, employees can be laid off without notice, retirement plans can be scuttled, there may be a number of years between raises, businesses can be sold or shut down with the loss of jobs.
 In the private sector, there are no guarantees. That is a reality.
 The stipulation that all current custodial workers be hired should be more than enough.
 We agree with commissioner Lloyd Thiel’s assessment. He said, “I work for the people of Park County paying bills. I’m not going to subsidize people. It’s not that I don’t feel for them, it’s just that I don’t care to waste money.”
 Facing a severe budget deficit, the county commissioners need to take drastic measures to save money. The taxpayers’ money.
 The county now spends $421,477 in custodial wages plus many excellent benefits including a great health insurance plan.
 If turning over custodial duties to private business can save money and reduce the deficit, the commissioners need to bite the bullet and do it.

MLS anticipates soccer's status in the U.S. will be boosted when the Americans co-host the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada.
 "We definitely have the demographics in our favor, both in terms of youth and diversity. So I think we'll pass baseball and hockey and be the No. 3 sport in the U.S. behind football and basketball," Berg said Wednesday at the league's kickoff event.
 MLS expanded to 26 teams this season with the addition of David Beckham's Inter Miami and Nashville, and plans are in place to reach 30 franchises by 2022 -- triple the league's low from 2002-04. The league has increasingly attracted better players from South America, and Berg called youth academies the league's "crown jewel."
 "The academies will be pumping out just incredible talent, which will help both the league and the U.S. men's national team such that we will vault way past Liga MX and the U.S. men's national team will vault way past Mexico, and then it will come down to the media deals," said Berg. "Whether we can be a top-five league or a top-three league will really come down at the end of the day to money, our ability to compete for players.
 "I think the good news is players want to play here. We're the United States of America. People want to live here. It's an incredible lifestyle. The infrastructure is fantastic."
 Mas partnered with Beckham, the former England captain Beckham, and envisioned the league's 50th year in 2045.
 "I think the MLS will be one of the top sports leagues in the United States. I think it will be on par or exceed the best leagues in the world, the Premier League or Serie A or La Liga worldwide," Mas said. "I think that the MLS 25 years from now will be Premier League-ish if we want to so-call it that on the metrics that leagues are measured by."
 U.S. national team coach Gregg Berhalter thinks American broadcast standards will be key.
 "I see in the 25 years, the whole world watching our game on television," he said. "The production quality that we can produce in America, we're going to be the leader in soccer."
 Clark Hunt, CEO of MLS' Dallas team and the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs, compared soccer's progress in the U.S. to that of the NFL, which celebrated its 100th anniversary this season.
 "The momentum that we have I think has a chance to take us to where the NFL is today," he said.
 Beckham boosted the league when he played for the LA Galaxy from 2007 to 2012, a deal that gave him the right to buy an expansion fee at a discounted price of $25 million.
 "Do I think in the next 10 years it will challenge the European leagues? It's what we all hope for. It's what we all strive to commit to," Beckham said. "This should never be a league where players from Europe come to retire. That's not where you want to be. It's not where we want to be as owners."
 Austin, Texas, and Charlotte, North Carolina, join the league next year, followed by St. Louis and Sacramento, California.
 Charlotte, announced in December, agreed to pay a $325 million expansion fee. The original teams that started play in 1996 paid $5 million each.
 Detroit, Las Vegas and Phoenix remain in contact with the league, which also is monitoring efforts in San Diego. More warm-weather cities would help the schedule early and late in the year.
 "We have no plan in place to go past 30," MLS Commissioner Don Garber said. "It's conceivable that in time we might look at a larger league to be able to address some of those challenges."
 Hunt recalled the league's low point.
 "When we launched in the mid-'90s, there was a lot of excitement, but we almost didn't make it," he said.
 Carolyn Kindle Betz, CEO of St. Louis, spoke about being a rare female controlling owner in soccer but also misspoke, referring to the "Major Soccer League" before correcting herself.
 MLS also announced a new league anthem to be used for walkout music, composed by Academy Award and Grammy winner Hans Zimmer. There is also a new deal with Second Spectrum, which is installing optical tracking that will produce data that MLS Commissioner Don Garber said can be used for technical staffs, broadcasts and betting. The company already works with the Premier League and the NBA.

IAG, which also owns Iberia and Aer Lingus, usually gives an earnings forecast at this time of year but said the ongoing uncertainty of the impact and duration of coronavirus meant it could not give accurate profit guidance at this stage.
 The company said that it was cutting costs and implementing revenue initiatives to help it weather the storm, following rival airlines such as Germany's Lufthansa and Amsterdam-based KLM which have cut costs in recent days.
 At IAG, flight cancellations due to falling travel demand would constrain capacity growth this year, it said, adding it expected to cut more flights on its short-haul European network in the coming days, in response to an outbreak of the virus in Italy.
 For 2019, IAG reported a 5.7per cent drop in operating profit to 3.285 billion euros, slightly ahead of a downgraded forecast of 3.27 billion euros it gave in September when it said a pilots strike would result in a 215 million euros hit.

 It's been more than 10 years since LCC's last bond, which shows me they don't take lightly the decision to ask us for more money. I appreciate that the college listened to our feedback and decided to cut the amount of the bond from the original $145 million to a more reasonable $121.5 million.
 It also matters that the college is prioritizing keeping the bond funds local and working to ensure that any people working on the awarded contracts receive a livable wage with benefits. I support Lane Community College's proposed bond for the May ballot and hope you will also.

This year marks the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment giving women the right to vote.      But long before that milestone in America, Wyoming territory became the first in the nation to pass the Women's Suffrage Act, guaranteeing women the unconditional right to vote and hold public office. On Sept. 6, 1870, Louisa "Eliza" Swain, age 69, put a clean apron over her dress and walked to the polls, becoming the first woman in America to cast a ballot under full civic equality to men.      Wyoming is commemorating these historic anniversaries with yearlong special exhibits, events and tourism activities where visitors can celebrate women of the West and find empowering moments for their own lives.      Women's history   Though commonly known as the Cowboy State, Wyoming's true nickname is the Equality State for its role in women's suffrage and in recognition of the contributions of women past, present and future.      Laramie plans its annual reenactment and events later in the year. The centerpiece of the plaza in front of the Wyoming House for Historic Women is a life-size bronze sculpture of Louisa Swain. Her ballot was cast one block from the plaza. The annual Louisa Swain Day will be celebrated on Sept. 6 -- 150 years after her historic vote.      In Cody, Wyoming native and artist Lindsay Linton Buk has special exhibits on display at the Buffalo Bill Center of the West through Aug. 2. Her project, Women in Wyoming, features large scale portraits and audio soundscapes to profile today's women across five themes: Breaking Boundaries, Filling the Void, Power, Rising and the Cowgirl State.      These statewide events tell the story of the long, hard battle for women's right to vote in Wyoming. The national women's suffrage movement was gaining traction in the 1840s. Women had no rights to property or their own wages, and they were barred from most professions. The idea of women voting or holding elective office was radical and inflamed much of the population. In the 1913 Washington, D.C., grand protest march, 5,000 women endured slurs, taunts and even injury. Some were sent to jail.      Seven years later women across America claimed victory when the l9th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution was ratified. In Wyoming, Nellie Taylor Ross became the first female governor when she took office in 1925.      More to see   Visitors to the state can celebrate women's suffrage milestones and experience exciting tourist destinations as well. Fly into Cheyenne, rent a car and begin to explore the state's historic treasures, outdoor activities, mountains and dude ranches. In Cheyenne, the Cowgirls of the West Museum preserves Western culture and honors the true spirit of strong women of the West.      Don't miss the newly renovated state capitol building, a National Historic Landmark where Wyoming women's suffrage was upheld as the territory sought statehood.      From Cheyenne, the Rockies to Tetons and Park to Park routes allow visitors to see the sights of Laramie and South Pass City on the way to Jackson. The Breakin' Through statue dominates the campus at the University of Wyoming in Laramie. The 16-foot-tall statue is a woman rider breaking through a 20-foot- high sandstone wall.      In Jasper the Nicolaysen (The Nic) is unique because it was started by women who are still the driving force today. The Nic is honoring the Year of the Woman with ongoing exhibits, three rotations of art and 10 female artists.      Sisters on the Fly is a sisterhood of women who get together for outdoor vacations such as fly fishing trips, horseback riding and kayaking. Participants learn all about it at the Sisters' cowgirl boot camp.      Laramie area dude ranches and resorts are a good choice for family fun. The VeeBar Guest Ranch, Brush Creek Ranch and Saratoga Hot Springs Resort are popular. The Terry Bison Ranch is America's only bison train tour where guests and day visitors can feed the bison and learn about their importance in American history.      On the way, there are fascinating local stops and inspiration for ways to expand travel routes. In Centennial, the charming Mountain View Hotel and Cafe is a lovingly restored 1907 hotel and restaurant and a logical home base for adventures into surrounding lands.

Many Californians pay $1,500 a year for electricity. Let that run for 20 years, and you are talking about the price of a new pickup truck.

Thirty years ago, you would have been hard-pressed to turn on a radio and not hear a Janet Jackson song.      Jackson was everywhere since the release of her iconic album, "Rhythm Nation 1814." In fact, this very week in 1990, the album's third single, "Escapade," was heading into the top 10 on Billboard's Hot 100. The song topped the chart the next month and would remain No. 1 for three consecutive weeks.      "Escapade" went on to become Jackson's 10th No. 1 single, but that was only the beginning of the accolades "Rhythm Nation 1814″ would achieve. The album is one of the greatest ever released, producing seven top five singles. That was something even her brother Michael could never claim.      "Miss You Much" (No. 1), "Rhythm Nation" (No. 2), "Escapade" (No. 1), "Alright" (No. 4), "Come Back To Me" (No. 2), "Black Cat" (No. 1) and "Love Will Never Do (Without You)" (No. 1) all made the top five. The album's eighth single, "State Of The World" maxed out at No. 7. Look how close some of those songs came to hitting the top of the charts. Can you imagine if those others would have done so to that magnitude? Even this was unprecedented.      "Rhythm Nation" was the biggest-selling album of 1990, with sales topping 12 million. History was rewritten numerous times with this record.      So, why the hype all over again? Well, Jackson is coming back with a new album soon and a huge tour. "Black Diamond," her 12th studio album, is due out soon, along with a supporting arena world tour.      I love Janet's explanation for the "Black Diamond" title.      "Black Diamonds are the toughest of all diamonds," Jackson said. "They are the hardest to cut, as well as the hardest to hurt and to destroy. There is a lot I have endured. I see myself as a Black Diamond in its purest form. I'm a rock. I have rough edges but I keep moving forward. I want to show you my strength as well as give you my strength."      Janet, you might see yourself as a rock, but think you're badass! I am a lifelong fan and a huge admirer of you as a person, a performer, a humanitarian and a philosopher. The concept behind "Rhythm Nation 1814" was brilliant and the album forever changed music and a generation of music lovers like me. By addressing such social issues as racism, poverty, drug abuse and indifference, she gave voice for those who had none. It's as relevant today as it was three decades ago. Couple that with a few playful tracks and you have an iconic masterpiece.      To this day, "Rhythm Nation 1814" is a frequently played commodity in my house. The album is an instant pick-me-up. There are no bad tracks.      New Janet Jackson music is always a big deal to me. And the "Black Diamond Tour," is a must-see. I have only had the luxury of witnessing her live show once before and that was 18 years ago for the "All For You" tour.

"Our children will be staying at home the whole time, so I feel sorry for them," she said.
 A 40-year-old single mother in Fukuoka said, "I doubt whether shutting down schools alone will have significance."
 "Unless companies suspend their operations, parents could bring the coronavirus to their homes," she said. The mother usually works between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., leaving her 10-year-old daughter in the care of her parents after school.
 "I will have to ask my company to shorten my work hours," she said. "I will suffer serious economic damage, as I work on an hourly wage."
 A 36-year-old company employee from Yokohama who raises a 7-year-old girl with her husband, who also works, said that although the emergency closure is understandable in light of the importance of protecting children, she was frustrated with the government's initial failure to prevent the spread of the virus.
 "I have to overcome the situation by telecommuting and with support from my husband and my parents," she said.
 A corporate worker in her 40s in Saitama who is married to a working husband complained, "Not many companies in Japan are prepared to introduce telecommuting."
 "I wonder how far parents should restrict our children's activities" to prevent them from having contact with others, she said. The pair are raising an elementary schoolgirl and a nursery school toddler.
 "I don't think my children will be able stay at home for over a month," she said.
 In the meantime, the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry on Thursday called on nursery schools and after-school daycare facilities to stay open to support double-income households affected by the nationwide school closure request.

“Bloomberg can absolutely be that candidate,” she said.
 Bloomberg’s pitch that he’s got the financing and the New York-bred sharp elbows to take on Trump resonated with stay-at-home mother Emily Dastrup, 42, from the suburban community of Kaysville.
 She’s a Republican but voting Democrat in the primary. A devout member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Dastrup is hoping a moderate wins the nomination since she’s deeply skeptical about socialism.
 “I’m trying hard to find a candidate to vote for. I believe in voting very much, and I really believe in being a good example for my children,” she said. “I’m tired of rabid ideology and holding that up as something to be proud of.”
 Faith can cut both ways for Democrats campaigning Utah: While distaste for Trump is often rooted in Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sensibilities, most members are conservative on issues like abortion.
 That's a defining issue for Alicia Alba, 40, of Lindon, south of Salt Lake City. She’d voted for almost every Republican she could — until the 2016 presidential race.
 “I have been against Trump from the very first time he came down that escalator,” she said. This year, she considered Bill Weld, Trump’s long-shot GOP rival, but ultimately decided she wanted to have more of a say about who would become the president’s Democratic opponent.
 Finally, she discovered that Amy Klobuchar had said she supports a “big tent” Democratic party that includes abortion opponents. Alba believes making abortion obsolete means supporting women and families with programs at every stage of life, something she doesn't hear much talk about from Republican candidates.
 “I reached out to my county clerk and asked them to send me a Democratic primary ballot for the first time in my life,” she said. If Klobuchar doesn't win the nomination, though, she's not sure she can vote for the nominee.
 “The choice between Republicans and Democrats right now is, if you want to protect people before they’re born or after they’re born,” she said. “And that’s a pretty rotten choice.”

"Touching dos Santos would be very politically risky," said Paula Cristina Roque, an Oxford University-based Angola analyst.
 She believes Lourenco -- known as "JLo" amongst Angolans -- strategically targeted the ex-ruler's offspring because they had no strong backing in the ruling People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA).
 "Dos Santos is a different story."
 \- 'No facts' -
 Critics of Lourenco's anti-corruption drive say the high-profile cases barely scratch the surface. They say other suspects -- including former vice- president and Lourenco protege Manuel Vicente -- are shielded from investigation.
 The MPLA is set to elect a new party leader next year and Lourenco is being careful not to make the wrong enemies, analysts say.
 Targeting the unpopular dos Santos children is also seen as a strategy to rack up support ahead of general elections in 2022.
 From her luxury exile in London and Dubai, Isabel dos Santos decried the investigations as a "witch-hunt".
 But at the offices of Angola's Palace of Justice, overlooking the oceanside capital Luanda, prosecutors disagree.
 "There is a focus on these two children because... prosecutors found that they mismanaged public assets," said attorney general spokesman Alvaro Joao.
 He told AFP several politicians were also under investigation, including former transport minister Augusto Tomas, who was jailed for corruption last year.
 "At the moment there are no facts to suggest the ex-president has committed any infraction," Joao said.
 He said as a former head of state, dos Santos would also be immune from criminal prosecution for five years after the end of his mandate.
 \- Corruption legacy -
 Dos Santos took office after the death of Angola's first president Agostinho Neto in 1979.
 He remained in power for 38 years, during which he saw the former Portuguese colony through a 27-year civil war that ended in 2002.
 Peace was followed by an economic boom as investors rushed in to tap Angola's vast oil reserves.
 Dos Santos reserved top jobs in his administration for close friends and family.
 Natural resource wealth amassed in the hands of a few, and evidence suggests large sums of public money were diverted to offshore accounts.
 "Corruption is an evil that has corroded Angolan society since the (MPLA) regime was implemented," said lawyer Salvador dos Santos, who heads an anti- graft association.
 "At the highest level no one lived off their salaries or through legal means," he said. "It was all about scam and fraud."
 He said the investigations commanded by the new government had raised awareness and prompted Angolans to speak out.
 \- 'His time will come' -
 As evening traffic crawled along Luanda's Hoji Ya Henda avenue, passers-by did not hold back their disapproval of the dos Santos family.
 "I don't even have words for Isabel dos Santos," said mechanic Tayson Madrugada, 20. "She messed around with our country and opened businesses that did not give jobs to the youth."
 Driver Jacob Denis, 48, said only dos Santos senior was responsible for handing powerful posts to his children.
 "The kids are not to blame," said Denis. "When you are a son and your father gives, are you not going to take?"
 Angolan investigative journalist Rafael Marques de Morais was confident dos Santos would be held accountable once his immunity is lifted in 2022.
 "Many of the people who have been indicted refer back to him," Marques told AFP. "There are investigations... and he will have to answer questions."
 Judges at his son's trial last week received a written response from dos Santos stating he had personally authorised former central bank governor Valter Filipe da Silva to move $500 million to Switzerland to guarantee an investment fund.
 Da Silva is accused of embezzling the money alongside dos Santos's son and two others. Both denied that.
 "His time will come," Marques said of the former president. "The question is whether his health will hold him steady until 2022."

Forget the idea that the Sounders had a relatively easy road to the semifinals. Can't say that when you're knocked out in the round of 16.
 The consolation is that they can focus squarely on their regular season now. But the chance to claim an MLS first disappeared for them Thursday.
 "I don't care how we lost or what the circumstances were. It's extremely disappointing. We like to think of ourselves as a big club," said Sounders coach Brian Schmetzer, whose team lost 4-2 on PKs to its Honduran opponent after tying 4-4 on aggregate. "In every game we play we like to think we are better than our opponent. I personally am extremely disappointed."
 Since the 2008 format to the CONCACAF Champions League — which encompasses the top clubs teams from North and Central America — no MLS team has won. Not the Galaxy despite its five MLS Cups. Not DC United despite its four MLS Cups. The international competition has always proved too much for the American and Canadian squads.
 Two years ago, the Sounders poured all their resources into trying to capture the tourney, only to lose forward Jordan Morris for the season to a torn ACL. But that didn't seem to deter Seattle in going all in this time around.
 Coming off a 2-2 tie against Olimpia in Honduras last week, Schmetzer put his best team on the field Thursday. And despite allowing an early goal, it looked as though Seattle was heading to the next round until the 86th minute.
 First, Sounders midfielder Cristian Roldan headed in a goal from new teammate Joao Paulo at the 21-minute mark to tie the score at 1-1. Then, Joao Paulo scored off a Roldan assist in the 64th minute to give the Sounders the lead and unleash the home crowd.
 It seemed reminiscent of the last home game Seattle played at CenturyLink Field, when they squashed Toronto, 3-1, to capture the MLS championship.
 And then it looked a whole lot different.

The European Commission recommended in May opening the talks with Albania and North Macedonia and a decision was expected at a European Council summit on 17-18 October 2019.(25)   But, as we know, France refused to say Yes to the opening of the talks for the accession of Albania and North Macedonia to the European Union.(26) All the Western Balkan countries are _en route_ to the EU, albeit in different stages, with Montenegro and Serbia the only ones that have opened accession talks since 2014.(27) Regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations, along with the adoption of the EU _acquis_ and economic growth are just few criteria for the opening of the talks about EU membership. Though observers including U.S. officials say inclusivity is the key to making it work, the plan as it stands offers few incentives for other states to join. The Special Correspondent of the White House for the negotiations between Kosovo and Serbia, Richard Grenell, expressed his support for the initiative of the countries of the Western Balkans on free movement.

CAIRO (AP) — A commercial ship has rescued 35 Europe-bound migrants off Libya's Mediterranean coast and returned them to the capital, Tripoli, the U.N. migration agency said. The International Organization for Migration tweeted that migrants, who were intersected on Thursday, were given medical assistance and relief items upon disembarkation. “Saving lives at sea is a moral and legal obligation. It is however unacceptable that migrants continue to be returned to an unsafe port,” said the IOM. Libya, which descended into chaos following the 2011 uprising that toppled and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi, has emerged as a major transit point for African and Arab migrants fleeing war and poverty to Europe. Most migrants make the perilous journey in ill-equipped and unsafe rubber boats. As of last October, roughly 19,000 migrants have drowned or disappeared on the sea route since 2014, according to IOM. Last week, a rubber dinghy packed with 91 migrants that set out from Libyan shores for Europe, apparently went missing in international waters in the Mediterranean Sea after leaving Libya on Feb. 8. In recent years, the European Union has partnered with the coast guard and other Libyan forces to stop the flow of migrants. Rights groups say those efforts have left migrants at the mercy of brutal armed groups or confined in squalid detention centers that lack adequate food and water. The latest developments come amid criticism of the European Union’s lack of rescue missions in the Mediterranean Sea. Member countries agreed earlier this month to end an anti-migrant smuggler operation involving only surveillance aircraft and instead deploy military ships to concentrate on upholding a widely flouted U.N. arms embargo that's considered key to winding down Libya's relentless war.

The public forests are in an interesting position these days: Keep them intact for carbon sequestration or use them on a sustainable basis for building materials.
 The folks who want to lock up the forests and also endorse restrictive land- use laws (some with good intentions and public support) are probably the same people who clamor for affordable housing.
 Multiple layers of costly government -- volumes of federal, state and local regulations, excessive taxes, fees and permits and expensive building materials -- further increase costs and make it virtually impossible to build low-cost housing.
 Typically, young couples started with a two-bedroom, one-bath home on a 50-by-100-foot lot. In some places today, a home like that could sell for $1 million or more based on supply and demand and greatly increased population. In a low-demand location, it might go for $30,000.
 In 1950, the median price for a home was around $8,000. Adjusted for inflation and using the same conditions that existed for builders back then, the price today would be around $90,000. Wouldn't that be nice? You can't have your cake and eat it too.

From his family, who constantly supported him.
 And from that potentially life-saving push when he was 6 years old.
 It was just a playful shove from his older brother that knocked the youthful Andrews to the ground. A mysterious-looking rash suddenly developed on his upper torso, arm and under one eye.
 That set off alarms and led to an early diagnosis of aplastic anemia, a rare condition in which the bone marrow fails to produce new blood cells.
 His childhood ordeal helped form a "conquer-anything" mentality that started him down the road to where he is today — an elite runner who takes a scientific approach to lowering his time.
 "I don't know if it's conscious but it definitely shaped my personality, having gone through that and come out on the other side," said t he 29-year- old from Concord, Massachusetts, who's making his second Olympic marathon trials appearance. “There's definitely an attitude coming through of, 'Hey, you've done pretty good so far, so let's appreciate this and be thankful we're still here.'”
 Andrews may not be the most recognizable name or among the favorites in Saturday's race. Don't be surprised, though, should he make a run at one of the three U.S. men's marathon spots for the Tokyo Games.
 He's faced tough odds before.
 Ask Andrews about his childhood illness and he can't recall all that much. He remembers things like being afraid of the nurses when they came into his room during nightly visits to draw blood. Or hoping to get the room with the better video-game console while waiting for treatments.
 His parents, Tim Andrews and Valerie Cummings, recall everything. How horsing around with his brother led to the detection of his disease. After his fall, Tyler Andrews developed petechiae, which are round spots that appear on the skin as a result of bleeding.
 They took him to the hospital, where doctors made the discovery of aplastic anemia.
 He essentially needed to have his bone marrow rebooted. So doctors suppressed it through chemotherapy and then just waited to see if it worked.
 It was about a six-month process.
 "A brief time in the grand scheme of things," his father said. “But in the middle of it? It seemed like an eternity. They did incredible work with him."
 To this day, Andrews still sees the same pediatric specialist. He sits in the waiting area in the tiny chairs before undergoing lab work. He's always received the same sort of report — no sign of the disease reappearing.
 "It's a lot of the same staff and they're always excited to see him," his mom said. “It's sort of like the miracle child coming in."
 In high school, he went out for the cross country team only because his brother participated. His best time was around 18 minutes, 30 seconds, which was solid but not the sort of showing that screamed future Olympic marathon trials qualifier. He got faster at Tufts University, a Division III school in Medford, Massachusetts.

This has resulted in a staggering rise in the use of end-point devices. Managed services allow businesses the peace of mind as they don’t need to worry about the upfront cost in setting private lines or the huge expense in buying VPN equipment. As enterprises increasingly use public internet to connect to the cloud network in various regions, the demand for such solutions gets intensified for securing of the network from attackers. Managed VPN offers a secure and scalable network connectivity with a single point of administration that enabled businesses to scale up or down depending on their organizational needs.

INDIANAPOLIS -- If your favorite NFL team doesn't have a Tyreek Hill, Julio Jones or Courtland Sutton streaking down the field, making cornerbacks cringe and constantly redefining the highlight catch, just wait.
 Chances are good they'll grab one in this year's draft.
 The NFL scouting combine in Indianapolis features a tantalizing wide receiver class unlike anything ever seen at the league's annual gathering of top prospects.
 "You've probably heard every GM and coach talk about this wide receiver class; it is a good one," Jets GM Joe Douglas said. "Just watching them go across the stage, there is a lot of talented players and we see how much the pass game affects the National Football League. So we do feel good about this group."
 Actually, teams feel great about the 2020 receivers.
 Teams are more willing than ever to bypass the old wait-and-watch standby for a plug-and-play approach with bigger, faster, quicker pass-catchers coming out such as Calvin Ridley and D.J. Moore who made an immediate impact in 2018, followed by Deebo Samuel, DK Metcalf, Marquise Brown, Terry McLaurin and A.J. Brown, who wasted no time establishing their credentials last season.
 "There is a lot more receivers coming into the draft because there's just a lot more receivers in college football and high school football," Rams GM Les Snead said. "A lot of teams running three, four, five wides."
 It starts way before college.
 "I think in today's day and age where these guys were starting 7-on-7, it's almost like AAU basketball," Packers GM Brian Gutekunst said. "The receivers are so much more advanced in terms of their fundamentals coming into college and the league than maybe they have been in the past. It's really just the NFL offense that will take time. So I think there's some guys sitting here today that I think will have a chance to make a pretty immediate impact, and I'm excited about that."
 Receivers may still need to adjust to the NFL's press coverage but just as often they're the ones putting the DBs on their heels from the get-go.
 "Historically, receivers have struggled a little bit with the learning curve up to the NFL. But in the last three, four or five years, we've seen a lot of guys make immediate" impacts, said Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta.
 "Especially last year, if you look at the class, you'll see a bunch of guys come in right away and make big plays. We were fortunate last year with Marquise and even Miles (Boykin) to a degree made plays for us. We're excited about those two guys and we look at this year's draft class as an opportunity for us to improve at the position even more."
 Every team does.
 "I think it's a combination of things," Washington Redskins coach Ron Rivera said. "I think teams are starting to understand how you use players. But I also do think because the ball is being thrown so much in college football the receiver is learning to be an explosive guy.
 "I also think the body types of the receivers is changing," Rivera said. "I think they're getting bigger and stronger. There's a lot more guys that are coming out that are ready to go and are dynamic players. The guys I think people are really looking for are these bigger receivers who are dynamic with the ball in their hands."
 Guys such as Colorado's Laviska Shenault, Alabama's Jerry Jeudy and Henry Ruggs III, Oklahoma's CeeDee Lamb, LSU's Justin Jefferson, Arizona State's Brandon Aiyuk and Clemson's Tee Higgins.
 Just to name a few.
 The wide receiver group is "as deep as I've seen," NFL draft analyst Daniel Jeremiah said. "I've got 27 wide receivers with top-three round grades in this draft. And consider average 31 are taken. We had a max of 35 taken in (2015). So this is a really phenomenal group of wideouts."
 There's someone for everyone this year, whether they're looking for a deep threat, a crisp route-runner, a fearless man going over the middle or even taking the direct snap like Shenault did so often at Colorado.
 "Receiver, of all positions, probably comes in the Baskin Robbins 31 favors," Bills general manager Brandon Beane said. "Size, speed, length, run after catch, all sorts of variables."
 This year, especially.
 "I think there could be a lot of guys drafted all the way through from 1 to 7 (rounds)," Beane said. "We were talking about it the other day. There's going to be guys drafted on the third day of the draft who may come in and take a veteran's spot on a team. It's that deep."
 Las Vegas Raiders GM Mike Mayock noted an average of 12 wide receivers have been selected in the first three rounds over the past decade, and this year's group features twice that number who are graded by teams as top-100 talents.
 "So, there's depth throughout and there's quality up top," Mayock said.
 And there's jockeying for cream-of-the-crop status when they showcase their skills during on-field workouts at Lucas Oil Stadium in prime time on Thursday night.
 The best of the bunch is probably Jeudy or Lamb, but they all sport that one attribute that premier pass catchers also possess: a confidence bordering on cockiness.
 Jeudy said he's the best, but he's hearing everyone else say they're the best.
 "I feel like everybody should think they're the best receiver coming out in the class," Jeudy said.
 They all might end up being part of the best wide receiver class ever.

 Perhaps no figure is more a part of Texas History and American folklore than Davy Crockett. In his life on the frontier and his death, he has been a hero to millions of Americans for generations.
 David Crockett was born in the mountains of eastern Tennessee in 1786. He was the fifth of nine children in a farming family. By the age of twelve, he was part of cattle drives from Tennessee into Virginia. He had little formal education and taught himself to read, write, and add. He became known for his quick wit and storytelling.
 By 1816, Crockett and his new family settled in Lawrence County, Tennessee, where Crockett farmed, hunted, and ran two mills and a distillery. He was soon elected as county commissioner and became a lieutenant colonel in the local militia unit. He was elected to the state legislature by 1821 and to Congress by 1827.
 He had a bitter falling out with President Andrew Jackson over federal land sales and treatment of Native American tribes. As a result, Jackson used all of his political will to destroy Crockett's political career.
 He lost the 1834 election to Adam Huntsman, a Jackson ally. After the bitter defeat, Crockett left for Texas in 1835, seeking the promise of new lands and a fresh start.
 As for Huntsman, Crockett's eldest son, John Wesley Crockett, defeated him for re-election in 1836, avenging his father's name once and for all.
 Crockett's time in Texas was short. Almost immediately upon his arrival, he was swept up in the excitement of the Texas Revolution as Mexico was pulled apart. He joined a volunteer unit heading to San Antonio to meet the approaching forces under Gen. Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna.
 Crockett reached the Alamo on February 8, 1836, and began shoring up the old mission's defenses. By February 23, the Mexican army arrived and the siege began. The defenders held out for two weeks against a heavily armed force ten times their size. Santa Anna seized the mission on March 6, and 182 defenders perished.
 What happened to Crockett at the fall of the Alamo has been a source of intense debate for many years. Some studies contended for years that he fought to the bitter end, never surrendering. Reports from Mexican troops contended that he was captured, and while Santa Anna's troops, impressed with his bravery, pled for Crockett's life, the bitter and vainglorious general ordered his execution anyway. Regardless, when Texas troops made their stand in that desperate siege, Crockett stood with them.
 In the years after his death, Crockett became a larger-than-life legend, adored by countless Americans. Numerous landmarks were named in his honor. The town of Crockett was founded near Houston in 1837. Crockett County in western Tennessee, not far from Memphis, was named for him in 1871 (with the county seat in the community of Alamo). Crockett County in West Texas was named for him in 1891. Numerous schools have been named after him, including in Austin, Dallas, and Grand Prairie. This is in addition to the Crockett National Forest and Lake Davy Crockett, both in East Texas.
 Many films, books, and television shows have told and re-told his tale often. Perhaps the most famous was the Walt Disney depiction on television that originally appeared in 1954 and 1955, starring Fess Parker as Crockett in a coonskin cap. American children were captivated by the wild frontiersman image of Crockett, reportedly buying millions of coonskin caps to imitate Parker's portrayal of the \"King of the Wild Frontier.\" In modern America, the legend has become almost inseparable from the man.

FILE -In this Sunday, Sept. 8, 2019 file photo the sun pierces the clouds over international waters north of Libya in the Mediterranean Sea. A rubber dinghy packed with 91 migrants that set out from Libyan shores in hopes of reaching Europe has apparently gone missing in the Mediterranean, the U.N. refugee agency said Thursday, Feb. 20, 2020. The inflatable boat carrying mostly African migrants departed from al-Qarbouli, 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of the capital Tripoli on Feb. 8, said Osman Haroun, whose cousin was on board. He hasn’t heard from the 27-year-old Mohamed Idris, or his 10 other friends also on the boat, since.
