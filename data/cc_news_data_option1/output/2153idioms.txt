THE COVID-19 lockdown has claimed many businesses in rural Queensland and a Banana Shire bowls club is among those staring down the barrel.
 The Biloela Bowls Club has fought a lot of battles over the years but now may be its toughest yet with the bills continuing to pile up while the doors remain shut.
 Biloela Bowls Club management committee chairman Sam Lunck said the club faces a difficult road ahead.
 “There is no way to sugar coat it – the club has been struggling financially for several years,” Mr Lunck said.
 “We pay nearly $24,000 in rates a year, $12,000 in electricity, $12,000 in insurance among other licensing fees and charges.
 “The club was just starting to make some real positive steps forward when we were forced to close our doors due to the COVID-19 restrictions.
 “While we are closed we don’t bring in a single cent in revenue but we still have large bills like rates, electricity and insurance that need to be paid.”
 On March 23 the club announced it would close and cease all activities until further notice as the government implemented restrictions to counter the coronavirus pandemic.
 While restrictions have eased since then, Mr Lunck took to the club’s Facebook page on May 12 and explained it was unviable for the club to reopen during stage one restrictions and the doors still remain shut with stage two in effect.
 “We are a community-based club, run by its members and volunteers, who do their best to provide sporting facilities for people of all ages and abilities and a place where the public can socialise in a family friendly environment,” Mr Lunck said.
 “But in reality, the members of this club could be forced to make some really tough decisions in the next few months. Decisions that have been discussed by previous committees but put off in the hope that things will turn around.
 “This didn’t happen and COVID has just made a bad situation even worse.”
 Mr Lunck said if the club can reopen as restrictions ease further, there are a few projects they would like to pursue to improve the club.
 “There are several keys projects we are looking at implementing like having the building airconditioned and providing an outdoor entertainment area,” he said.
 “These would certainly help attract more patrons to the club, but in reality, they are projects that we cannot get off the ground without financial assistance from outside sources.
 “We are only a small club that relies heavily on volunteer labour and our volunteers have been doing a terrific job for a long time, battling to keep the doors open.”

He’s said it’s not just about preventing transmission but also about the impact it’s having on the health care system, especially regionally. A look at the Department of Health’s hospitalization chart shows the number of patients in the ICU and those on ventilators have remained steady through the last month.“Over the weekend we had the most ventilated patients with COVID-19 we had this whole time," said Dobbs Monday. "We’re down to 97 now but over the weekend we had 108 people who had coronavirus who had respiratory failure on the ventilators.”President-Elect of the Mississippi State Medical Association Dr. W. Mark Horne says what the state did early on was effective at keeping us from spiking early.“Unfortunately, we have hit this long slow plateau," explained Dr. Horne. "It is very very painful.”Horne says they’re also finding that many of the severe COVID-19 patients are requiring extended hospital stays that pull from resources and add to the concern.“This should be a time we were seeing a decline and we’re not and we worry that that means that things are going to be significantly worse going forward if we can’t break the back of this going back to the basics of preventing the spread the virus,” added Horne.Dr. Horne says there says good personal hygiene and public health measures are the only way to slow this virus.

“I don’t see a decrease. I don’t see a sideways. I see an increase,” he said. “I don’t feel that it is a good idea to proceed with the parade.”
 Parade organizers, Hutchinson said, have tossed around several ideas for the parade to move forward.
 One is to have a so-called reverse parade where people set up displays along a route and people drive through. Another would be to extend the parade route, but Hutchinson said that would require additional permits from the city of Belton and the Texas Department of Transportation to close roads, which would lead to backed-up traffic.
 “We’ve been exploring lots of options — everything from ways to extend the parade, ways to change the layout or set up. We talked about the … static parade where it would be a drive through,” Pittenger said. “There have been lots and lots of ideas put and considered. For many weeks, we’ve been talking about the what ifs and what we could do. However, as I’ve said all along, no decisions have been made.”
 Pittenger and other officials included in planning have said they are waiting for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to issue guidance before determining the parade’s fate.
 “Everything is on the table at this point for discussion. But we’re on hold waiting for the governor’s guidance,” Pittenger said.
 Other cities and areas — including Waco — have decided to postpone or completely shutter events similar to Belton’s Fourth of July bash.
 “I would think we should be able to make the same decision internally from our own county’s perspective,” Hutchinson said. “The committee wants to see, I guess, if it can move forward if it is blessed by the governor’s office.”

The Conservative leader said the U.K. needs to find new ways of controlling the virus, including more testing for people who have symptoms and tracing the contacts of infected people. One minister said Sunday that 17,200 people had been recruited to be contact tracers.
 Coronavirus has infected more than 4.6 million people and killed more than 312,000 worldwide, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University that experts say undercounts the true toll of the pandemic. The U.S. has reported more than 88,000 dead in the pandemic and Europe has had at least 160,000 deaths.

Two weeks into the reopening of Texas, coronavirus cases are climbing. New outbreaks still crop up. And at Guero’s Taco Bar in Austin, which offers the occasional celebrity sighting, a log of every diner and where they sat is begrudgingly in the works.
 “It seems like a huge invasion of privacy,” said owner Cathy Lipincott, who is nonetheless trying to comply with Austin’s local public health guidelines by asking, but not requiring, customers to give their information.
 Few states are rebooting quicker than Texas, where stay-at-home orders expired May 1. With cases still rising, including single-day highs of 1,458 new cases and 58 deaths Thursday, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has defended the pace by emphasizing steadying hospitalization rates and pointing out that Texas’ 1,200 deaths are still behind the tally from similarly big states, including California and Florida.
 But on the cusp of even more restrictions ending Monday, including gyms cleared to reopen, a political confrontation is growing over attempts by big cities to keep some guardrails. The dispute underscores the gulf between Democrats who run city halls and GOP leaders who call the shots in the capital in Texas, where unlike in other states, the governor’s orders supersede all local mandates during the pandemic.

Their controversial power-sharing deal calls for Netanyahu to serve as prime minister for the government’s first 18 months before being replaced by Gantz for the next 18 months. Their blocs will also have a similar number of ministers and mutual veto power over most major decisions.
 Critics have already accused the government of being out of touch by creating so many Cabinet posts at a time when unemployment has soared to 25% as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. But because Netanyahu’s bloc includes several smaller parties, he still only has a limited number of Cabinet ministries to hand out to the Likud rank and file.
 A rebellion by angry senior Likud members forced Netanyahu to seek a delay in the swearing-in ceremony Thursday. To mollify his backbenchers, Netanyahu created a series of new ministries with questionable responsibilities, such as “community development,” “settlement affairs” and “higher education and water resources” and a minister to be the liaison between the parliament and the Cabinet. Each ministry means paying for drivers, staff and office space.
 Yair Lapid, the new opposition leader, said the machinations have led to a loss of “trust of the Israeli public.”

Counties can apply to move through a four-stage reopening plan based on virus benchmarks in their area, including number of new cases per 100,000 residents over a 14-day period. So far, more than two dozen of the state's 39 counties have been approved to the second stage, which allows some businesses to reopen, including dine-in restaurants at half capacity.

“The whole point of the lockdown was to buy time to have a better way to keep numbers down,” said Jeremy Konyndyk, who led the humanitarian response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa during the Obama administration. “And that’s why so many of us are screaming ourselves hoarse about testing and tracing.”
 Public health experts say contact-tracing systems should be in place before cases become widespread so every new infection can be tracked and the person’s contacts identified, tested and isolated from the rest of the community.
 Until recently, there had been scant federal guidance on what contact tracing should look like, and there is still no coordinated federal strategy. While other countries are taking a national approach to contact tracing, the U.S. is leaving it to states to devise their own programs.
 The result has been a patchwork of efforts. The AP review in late April found little consensus among states on basic questions such as how many investigators are needed.

For his part, Britain’s Johnson, who was hospitalized last month with a serious bout of COVID-19, speculated Sunday that a vaccine may not be developed at all, despite the huge global effort to produce one.
 “I said we would throw everything we could at finding a vaccine,” Johnson wrote in the Mail on Sunday newspaper. “There remains a very long way to go, and I must be frank that a vaccine might not come to fruition.”
 Johnson said Britain was taking “baby steps” toward reopening, “trying to do something that has never had to be done before — moving the country out of a full lockdown.”
 “Despite these efforts, we have to acknowledge we may need to live with this virus for some time to come,” Johnson wrote.
