Here at CapeGOP, we are flattered that this year even the Democrats and Independents running for Freeholder want to be Republicans.
 The Democrat candidate (we think there are actually two, but one of them has been completely ignored by her own party) spends most of every day trying to convince Cape May County voters that he is actually a Republican. When we pointed out that he is the Democrat County Chairman and a Democrat candidate for Freeholder, he called that “a smear campaign” (LOL!). Really?! It is a smear campaign to call the Democrat Chairman a Democrat?! (LOL, again!!)
 But there are plenty of good reasons for everybody to want to be a Republican. Republicans support the men and women of Law Enforcement. We do not support defunding the police. Republicans believe we are capable as citizens of following safety protocols related to COVID-19 that will slow the spread but not shred the Constitution. Republicans believe that non-violent protests in support of political action are an important American tradition. We do not believe going into and looting, rioting and burning communities of color is good for those communities. Republicans believe in smaller, more efficient government that lets people freely live their lives instead of telling them how they must live their lives. Republicans still believe in and openly support things like faith, family, and country. We don’t engage in identity politics and instead follow Dr. King’s recommendation that all people be judged, not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.
 We can’t blame the opposition for wanting to be Republicans. We would welcome them with open arms because ours is a big tent party that does not try to put everyone into a racial or ethnicity or sexual orientation box.

The Cleveland Orchestra’s annual report shows the organization has taken a significant financial hit over the past year.
 The orchestra’s endowment is at a record high, but the money it draws from the endowment each year is not enough to cover the deficit, which has now doubled to $4 million. The orchestra also had fewer annual donations and didn’t make as much money from its residency in Miami, Fla. Earlier this year, the orchestra announced it would cut its Miami program from four weeks to two in response to donors who, according to Executive Director Andre Gremillet, "moved on."
 Only 5 percent of the orchestra's endowment can go toward funding operations. The rest is off limits, and Gremillet says the orchestra board wants to keep it that way.
 “We’re in this for the very long term," Gremillet said. "It’s very important that we be fiscally responsible and that we don’t use money for the endowment to fund our operations.”
 The orchestra also recently saw a 26 percent cut in funding from Cuyahoga Arts and Culture, whose grants are funded by the county's cigarette tax. Gremillet says that will hurt efforts to close the financial gap.
 “Obviously it’s a good thing that fewer people are smoking," Gremillet said. "But we need to think in the long term about how to replace that source of funding because what this orchestra does for Cleveland and northeast Ohio is huge in terms of contributing to the community.”
 Gremillet pointed out the orchestra does not lose money on student tickets, whose discounted prices are offset by philanthropic dollars. He says at the average concert a decade ago, fewer than 7 of every 10 seats were occupied by a paying ticketholder. Now, paying patrons occupy 8 out of 10 seats on average. Gremillet, who was appointed to succeed former Executive Director Gary Hanson in 2015, hopes the orchestra’s growing audience will encourage more donors.

You walk outside and you see the big trucks coming in and you see the sun rising over the mountains. I forget about all the problems. I forget about all the things that I think define who I am, and just feel that transience, people coming in and out and existing.”

It can be seen that the volcanic eruption has such potential for the benefit of humans and nature, which makes us surrender our eyes to the volcano again.: our design goal is to effectively collect and use the volcanic by-products to process them into building materials and other biochemical products. To "kill two birds with one stone" and minimize any damage caused by the volcanic eruption, then we can achieve the Reincarnation of the Ash.

“Elf on the Shelf” originated as a rhyming kids’s guide that reveals how Santa determines who's naughty and good. As the story goes, St. Nick deploys scout elves to watch over children between Thanksgiving and Christmas. The guide comes with a stuffed elf that (children, protect your eyes!) dad and mom are accountable for transferring round throughout the night time to make their little ones consider Santa is watching.

So from that standpoint, while the drought may enhance some of the colors, the stress is not a good thing and may be a harbinger of things to come with climate change."

I am terrified of flying. I've gotten _slightly_ better at it, but I'm pretty sure I'll never feel 100% comfortable. I know the statistics by heart; I know that flying in an airplane is much safer than driving in a car. And yet, every time I get on a plane, my mind races with thoughts of crashing. It's not that I'm afraid of dying; I'm just afraid of not being in control.

According to the release from Customs and Border Protection, the Homeland Security Department parent agency to Border Patrol, the woman and her newly delivered baby “were both in need of medical assistance.”
 “A Border Patrol EMT provided critical care to the mother, a Honduran national and her newborn until EMS arrived on scene, EMS transported the family to a local hospital for further evaluation and treatment,” the statement said. “After receiving medical care, the infant and her mother will be processed as per CBP guidelines.”
 Neither acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan nor agency spokespeople immediately responded to requests for comment.
 Amy Cohen, a child psychiatrist and executive of Every Last One, a nonprofit, said the hospital informed her that the baby has to be in the hospital for another seven to 10 days and was “in distress” when born. Almost exactly three weeks ago, Cohen responded to a nearly identical case of a mother giving birth unassisted just over the U.S. side of the border with Mexico, and Customs and Border Protection kept her apart from her baby for roughly four days, Cohen said. She‘s since been released from detention.

Another guideline asks cities to post the maximum number of children allowed at the entrance to each playground, as well as the maximum number allowed on each structure and the maximum number of each parent allowed so that social distancing can be maintained. It is also recommended cities provide direction on how to wait in line when maximum playground occupancy has been reached.
 “Once the state put out announcements on playgrounds, (staff) met very quickly to discuss these new guidelines,” DeGroot said. “There were some concerns from the city manager and city attorney about the pretty stringent cleanliness standards that were outlined for facility operators, which happened to be us. We are the operators.”
 One of the standards, DeGroot said, was that cities are encouraged to clean playground equipment on a daily basis, as well as frequently throughout the day.
 Staff conferred with the city’s insurance company, as well as with other communities in the county and the regional parks system, to see how everyone was reacting to the new guidelines, she said.
 “Some are doing nothing and they’re basically saying, ‘We’re going to stay the course with typical park maintenance and we’re going to put signage up that says play at your own risk,’” she said. “And then there are some that were saying, ‘We don’t think we can meet these guidelines and we’re not going to do anything right now until we figure out how we can find the staffing resources and operating dollars to even remotely meet some of these cleaning and sanitization measures.’”
 Lodi’s plan is to have one sign at smaller playgrounds, and possibly two at the larger ones, DeGroot said. The signs are provided by the state in both English and Spanish, she said, and she anticipates crews will begin installing the signs by the end of next week.
 Staff is also researching cost estimates from a cleaning contractor, because the city does not have the resources to send crews out to all 19 playgrounds on a daily basis for routine sanitization.
 “So right now we’re thinking about, and getting cost estimates, for a once-a- week cleaning,” DeGroot said. “We all feel this type of standard is probably not going to go away any time soon as long as we’re dealing with the COVID health emergency. So we hope to be able to get a plan together, probably by the end of next week and immediately begin the new cleaning protocols, and get the signage up and get those playgrounds open as quickly as possible.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — With just a month to go until the election, President Donald Trump had a busy schedule in the week before the coronavirus hit home with him. Trump tweeted early Friday that he and first lady Melania Trump had tested positive for the coronavirus. Typically, it can take four to five days for symptoms to show up after someone is infected with coronavirus. The incubation period can extend up to 14 days, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Forecasters said the 25th named storm of an unprecedented Atlantic hurricane season would likely crash ashore Friday evening somewhere on southwest Louisiana’s coast. Hurricane warnings stretched from High Island, Texas, to Morgan City, Louisiana.
 “The fact that it’s weakening should not cause anyone to lose focus or lose vigilance, because this is still a very strong storm,” Gov. John Bel Edwards said during a news conference.Delta, the latest in a recent flurry of rapidly intensifying Atlantic hurricanes that scientists largely blame on global warming, appeared destined to set records at landfall. It would be the 10th named storm to hit the continental United States this year, surpassing the number that hit in 1916.
 Delta would also be the first Greek-alphabet-named hurricane to hit the continental U.S. And as the fourth hurricane or tropical storm to hit Louisiana in a year, it would tie a 2002 record, Klotzbach said.
 The hurricane was expected to weaken rapidly over land. Forecasters predicted Delta would be downgraded to a tropical storm late Friday. The storm’s projected path showed it moving into northern Mississippi on Saturday and then into the Tennessee Valley as a tropical depression.
