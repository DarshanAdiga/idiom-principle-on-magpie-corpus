 # Peoria couple seeks Christmas Fund basket — but only if others receive one first
 Nick Vlahos
 Journal Star
 PEORIA – Don't get Audrey Samuels wrong. She and her husband, Steven, very much would appreciate a food basket this holiday season, courtesy of the Journal Star Christmas Fund.
 They've had a tough few years, including this one. Then again, who hasn't had a less-than-optimal 2020?
 Food baskets and toy-filled red stockings are hallmarks of the Christmas Fund, now in its 108th year. The Samuels have no children, so they have no use for the red stockings.
 As 60-something senior citizens on a fixed income, a little boost in the food department would be welcome.
 "Once you pay your bills and have very little left over, it's hard to juggle," Audrey Samuels said. "Do I get food or medicine? You have to rob Peter to pay Paul, and it gets really hard."
 Still, Samuels is well aware others have it much worse. That's why if push comes to shove this year regarding Christmas Fund food-basket availability, she and her husband appear willing to step aside.
 "I know there's families out there with children. I don't want to take away from anybody who has children," Samuels said. "If there a family out there that's in need and I've taken someone's spot, take me off the list."
 The Samuels have a roof over their heads. They reside in an independent-living complex in Central Peoria, near Reservoir Boulevard and Sterling Avenue. And even though their income is limited to Social Security and disability payments, it still is something.
 Not long ago, the Samuels had more.
 Audrey Samuels said she managed a West Bluff laundromat until the end of 2015. A new owner who wanted to clean house employee-wise dovetailed with an old back problem that kept getting worse.
 Eventually, Samuels required surgery.
 "For the first couple of weeks, it was amazing," she said about the aftermath. "After that, it wasn't so amazing. Now I'm right back where I started from."
 According to Samuels, her doctor said there isn't much more that can be done.
 Meanwhile, Steven Samuels has a bad right leg. He needs a second new hip — the first replacement wasn't done right, his wife said. He could use a new knee, too.
 Those issues led to Steven Samuels retiring from Taco Bell, where he worked just about every non-management job.
 Even before COVID-19, it appears the Samuels didn't leave home often.They are estranged from extended-family members, Audrey Samuels said.
 Hence the desire for a Christmas Fund food package, one of 4,250 the Journal Star intends to distribute this year.
 "It would mean I could probably have a pretty decent Christmas dinner," Samuels said. "Because otherwise, we're probably not going to have much."
 But not having much is not quite the same as not having anything. Samuels appears to realize that.
 "As long as I have soup and cereal in the house, I can manage with that," she said. "It just breaks my heart to hear there's kids that go to bed hungry every night. In the United States, nobody should go to bed hungry at night."
 Food-basket requests can be submitted through Tuesday. They can be mailed to Christmas Baskets, Journal Star, 1 News Plaza, Peoria, IL 61642, or by contacting Lisa Alexander at The Salvation Army, (309) 655-7272.
 Donations can be made online at ChristmasFundDonation.com, or checks can be sent to Journal Star Christmas Fund, P.O. Box 1549, Peoria, IL 61655.

An unsuccessful judicial review over the raids was launched by Mr Fitzgerald.
 In his ruling, Lord Justice Gross said: “This underlying offence was in essence fraud on and, effectively, corruption in local government… what was said to be a case of ‘jobs for the boys’.”
 The hearing was told that “Operation Sheridan had widened to include alleged criminality within Liverpool City Council and the Merseyside Pension Fund.”
 Sheridan is just one example of the chaotic backdrop the latest police activity falls against.
 Three further criminal probes in the past five years have targeted high- profile figures within the city’s development industry.
 In each of those investigations suspects were charged and allegations were discussed in court.
 None of those investigations secured convictions, with two of the prosecutions collapsing at early stages in the judicial process.

Another duel that was looked at with great interest was that of Samuel Nagai versus Mauricio Gomez. The young Checkmat phenom was faced with a very game opponent in ATT's Gomez, an athlete who is always dangerous and always entertaining to watch. Although a fun match on paper, Nagai came out very aggressive and gave no room for Mauricio to breathe or impose any type of game against the frenetic pace of the Manaus native. Once Samuel got a hold of Gomez's feet it was a wrap, as Nagai applied another powerful "botinha" lock (straight ankle lock with lapel grip) for the tap. Check out the full match results below.

Even with the new look, it's not a whole lot different from the 3rd generation, audio quality wise. Amazon has kitted the Dot with the same single 1.6-inch mono speaker which, thanks to the new design, sounds a tad fuller and with a slightly bigger soundstage, but you only really tell if you have both at hand to compare. While you can pair two Dots for a stereo pair, there's none of that fancy room tuning or Dolby Audio processing of the Echo, which isn't a surprise at its price point. The sound can get loud and pretty good for a device its size and price, but it's not as big an upgrade from its predecessor as the Echo is. Of course, since it lacks a dedicated woofer, it lacks the bass response, and the treble is muted as well, but vocals in songs and podcasts are spot on. This is not a party speaker - it's fine for casual listening as as long as you understand its emphasis on 'smart' over 'speaker', you won't be disappointed.

GREENWOOD -- There is a direct correlation between Greenwood's offense becoming the juggernaut it currently is and Hunter Wilkinson becoming healthy.
   
 "I'm so glad to be back to 100 percent," Wilkinson said.
   
 The Bulldogs averaged 33 points and 331 yards per game through the first three games of the season when Wilkinson was playing with a banged-up shoulder.
   
 The Bulldogs have averaged 46 points and 455 yards of offense over the last 10 games with a healthy Wilkinson.
   
 Some of that was also the emergence of the offensive line.
   
 "The first couple of games, we weren't running the ball very well." senior guard and captain Easton Erwin said. "We made some changes and it started to click. We have good leadership up front overall."
   
 Erwin, tackles Christian Brown and Braden Stein, center Ethan Cole, all seniors, and junior guard Jeremiah Presson along with junior Corben Webb who rotates in at tackle have also been on a mission to establish their presence at the bequest of Greenwood coach Chris Young.
   
 "We always try to come out and set the tone," Cole said. "(Young) talks to us all the time about it."
   
 Now, the offensive line is clicking, Wilkinson is healthy, the offense is rolling and the Bulldogs are going back to Little Rock.
   
 "It's a great opportunity we get to go play in Little Rock," Wilkinson said. "Our team works great together. We've been working a lot in practice about executing."
   
 Wilkinson has been a workhorse for the Bulldogs for three years with 591 carries for 3,447 yards and 59 touchdowns on the ground.
   
 "He's a kid that you don't replace," Young said. "He's a kid that you have come through your program once in a lifetime."
   
 His first 20-carry game was in a 62-33 win over Benton in 2018 when he had 25 totes for 163 yards and a touchdown as a sophomore.
   
 That was the first of 14 100-yard games in his career.
   
 "He seems to get better with every carry throughout a game," Young said. "That's maybe the most impressive thing about him.
   
 "You see some running backs get worn down the more carries they get. Hunter seems to get better as the game goes on."
   
 In Greenwood's 38-28 win over Lake Hamilton in November, Wilkinson had 20 carries for 203 yards and two touchdowns, but more telling, he had 13 carries for 153 yards and both of his touchdowns in the second half.
   
 "He's the total package," Young said. "We're so fortunate to have him in our program.
   
 "When he competes, he makes everybody else compete as well. He brings it every day."
   
 Wilkinson is part of a senior class that, as juniors, saw their season end last year a game short of Little Rock with a semifinal loss at Searcy.
   
 "It's always our goal to get to Little Rock," senior cornerback Jayden Jasna said. "Last year, we came up short.
   
 "These seniors knew what we had to do. It was a little bit of motivation. We had a little bit of a chip on our shoulder to get back to 'The Rock.' I'm happy for us to get back. We're going to go execute this next game."
   
 The seniors also had to go through a coaching change with veteran coach Rick Jones leaving for college football. His offensive coordinator and basically right-hand man, Young, was quickly promoted to the position, and the Bulldogs haven't missed a beat.
   
 "We've had Coach Young here ever since we've been here," senior safety Hayden Wells said. "He didn't change much. We're still doing the same thing before games and practices and everything."
   
 The Bulldogs rolled through the regular season and racked up victories over West Memphis, Mountain Home and Marion in the playoffs all via the Arkansas Activities Association's Sportsmanship Rule.
   
 "It's a good feeling," Erwin said. "Last year, we had a sour taste in our mouth when we left Searcy.
   
 "We've had it in the back of our head that it happened and we let it motivate us. We don't want to be in that situation again."
   
 With the Bulldogs on the verge of a 10th state title, Wilkinson is also on the brink of history at War Memorial Stadium on Saturday.
   
 Wilkinson has scored 66 offensive touchdowns in his career, which ties him with Bulldog great Drew Morgan in school history.
   
 "That's amazing," Wilkinson said. "When I got that news, I was shocked. It was a dream. I had to pinch myself to make sure it was real.
   
 "My goal is to break that record. I'm going to turn it up there and get that record broken."

WASHINGTON (AP) - A new report by a National Academy of Sciences committee has found that “directed” microwave radiation is the likely cause of illnesses among American diplomats in Cuba and China.The study commissioned by the State Department and released Saturday is the latest attempt to find a cause for the mysterious illnesses that started to emerge in late 2016 among U.S. personnel in Havana.The study found that “directed, pulsed radio frequency energy appears to be the most plausible” explanation for symptoms that included intense head pressure, dizziness and cognitive difficulties. It found this explanation was more likely than other previously considered causes such as tropical disease or psychological issues. The study did not name a source for the energy and did not say it came as the result of an attack, though it did note that previous research on this type of injury was done in the former Soviet Union.In its report, the 19-member committee noted that it faced significant challenges in trying to get to the bottom of the medical mystery. Among them, not everyone reported the same symptoms and the National Academy of Sciences research did not have access to all the previous studies on the illnesses, some of which are classified.“The committee found these cases quite concerning, in part because of the plausible role of directed, pulsed radiofrequency energy as a mechanism, but also because of the significant suffering and debility that has occurred in some of these individuals,” said committee chairman David Relman, a professor of medicine at Stanford University. “We as a nation need to address these specific cases as well as the possibility of future cases with a concerted, coordinated, and comprehensive approach.”The health effects were experienced by about two dozen Americans affiliated with the U.S. Embassy in Cuba as well as Canadian diplomats and personnel at the U.S. consulate in Guanghzhou, China, in early 2017.Some of the Americans have been critical of the U.S. government’s response to their health complaints and at least one has filed suit against the State Department.Between late 2016 and May 2018, several U.S. and Canadian diplomats in Havana complained of health problems from an unknown cause. One U.S. government count put the number of American personnel affected at 26.Some reported hearing high-pitched sounds similar to crickets while at home or staying in hotels, leading to an early theory of a sonic attack.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

The U.S. Navy routinely has tense encounters with the Revolutionary Guard, whose speed boats race alongside American warships in the Persian Gulf and sometimes conduct live-fire drills with machine-guns and missile launches in their presence.
 The Guard typically patrols the shallower waters of the Persian Gulf and its narrow mouth, the Strait of Hormuz. Iran's regular navy largely operates in the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. While previous commanders have made a point to differentiate between the professionalism of the two, Paparo dismissed it as an “old idea” that included a lingering belief that the service was still loyal to Iran's former shah, who was toppled in the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
 “Forty-one years into the revolution, I think we can dispense with that notion,” the vice-admiral said. “I sincerely doubt there’s a difference among them.”
 Paparo also said he did not believe the 5th Fleet's mission would be affected by the Navy potentially reconstituting a 1st Fleet responsible for the Indian Ocean.
 Still, Paparo's remarks carried a clear warning, quoting former U.S. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis at one point.
 “Be polite, be professional and have a plan to kill everyone in the room,” he said. “That’s how we conduct ourselves at sea.”

James "Jim" Sweet James Fredrick Sweet went to be with the Lord early Sunday morning, November 15th. He passed away at his home in Eureka and was lovingly attended to during the past couple of years by his children, Beth, Mary Sue, Jesse and Dan. Vital support was also received from Hospice of Humboldt and St. Joseph Home Care; as well as son-in-law, Steve and niece, Elizabeth. Jim was born on January 3, 1925 in Langlois, Oregon, the only son of Alfred James and Lenora Mae (Hofsess) Sweet. He and Audrey, his wife of over seventy years, were married on Christmas Day of 1947, in Bandon, Oregon, shortly after Jim's discharge from the Army Air Corps. They were married less than four months after first meeting at a dance in Bandon, Oregon. Jim and Audrey raised five children as they moved from the family dairy ranch near Bandon, Oregon to Ukiah, California; and from there they moved around to several communities in Del Norte County, finally ending up in Eureka in 1964. Jim loved and reverenced God and the Lord Jesus Christ and relished his Word. He wrote some years ago, "It is evident to me that in this life there is no hope aside from Jesus Christ. I find that he is my friend and am looking forward to meeting him face to face." After a stint in the Army Air Corp during WWII, Jim spent his early adult years in ranching. After that, he spent most of his working years in the logging and lumber industry; and finally at two pulp mills in Eureka. Jim was known for his craftmanship and loyalty to his family. Although the past two-and-a-half years were difficult for him he never complained and was always cheerful. Jim will be rejoining his wife, Audrey, who went to be with the Lord in June of 2018. He is survived by his five adult children, Daniel Sweet, Jesse Sweet (Kim), Mary Sue Prangley (John), Beth D'Ambra (Steve) and Wendy Ward; his sister-in-law, Judith Paseman; nieces Elizabeth Harvey and Molly Turner. Jim was proud to be the patriarch of a family that includes many grandchildren, great grandchildren, numerous nieces and nephews, as well as an extended family located primarily in Curry and Coos Counties in Oregon.

 SYDNEY, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Hardik Pandya smashed two huge sixes in the final over to give India a dramatic six-wicket Twenty20 victory over Australia on Sunday, sewing up the three-match series for the tourists with a game to spare.
 Chasing 195 for victory, India needed 14 runs from the last over and Pandya delivered with two runs off the first ball and sixes off the second and fourth deliveries, the latter flying deep into the stands at the Sydney Cricket Ground.
 Australia's bowling attack, making do without Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins, had kept the contest tight. But debutant Daniel Sams was unable to contain Pandya, who finished with 42 runs off 22 balls and was named Man of the Match.
 "It's fantastic," said Pandya. "I just wanted to finish it early, I don't like it when it goes down to the wire."
 The victory brought delight to a crowd mostly supporting the tourists and, after Friday's 11-run victory in Canberra, secured the series ahead of Tuesday's third and final match in Sydney.
 Openers Shikhar Dhawan (52) and KL Rahul (30) had given the tourists a strong start, and when skipper Virat Kohli took up the mantle, it looked like India might reach their target with some ease.
 Kohli looked in great shape as he stroked the ball around the ground, but his innings ended on 40 after he chased a high, wide delivery and was caught behind to give Sams a notable first international wicket.
 Earlier, with Aaron Finch ruled out by a hip injury, Matthew Wade was named Australia's 11th Twenty20 captain, and he led from the front with a typically aggressive 32-ball 58.
 Opening with D'Arcy Short, the wicketkeeper-batsman smashed 10 fours and a six to lay a decent platform for Australia's innings before being run out in farcical circumstances, caught ball-watching as Kohli dropped him at cover but collected the ball and hurled it in to Rahul at the stumps.
 Steve Smith, whose leadership credentials have been ignored since completing his ban for his part in the Newlands ball-tampering scandal, went on to make a solid 46 before he was caught by a juggling Pandya on the boundary.
 Glenn Maxwell delivered a 13-ball 22, but the innings stalled in the middle overs and Australia were grateful to Marcus Stoinis and Sams for the 17 runs they plundered off the last over to take the tally to a competitive 194 for five.
 Seamer T Natarajan, who impressed on debut with 3-30 in the series opener, was again the pick of the Indian bowlers with figures of 2-20 from his four overs. (Reporting by Nick Mulvenney; Editing by Hugh Lawson)

The spherical design allows Amazon to fit in two 0.8-inch tweeters alongside a 3-inch woofer for the highs and lows. Bear in mind, the sound is a lot more directional than previous generations, which means you have to be in front of the speaker to be in the sweet spot, and not 360-degree audio as the shape might suggest. Ergo, this can't be placed as a centerpiece, and is best with its back against a wall. The upside of the extra internal space that has been afforded is the big boost to audio quality and volume, hitherto unusual for a speaker in this price segment. Music emanating from the Echo is more room- filling than before (and more than the Nest Audio), and the Echo borrows from the room tuning smarts that are seen in more expensive speakers to estimate the shape and size of the listening space and adjust the audio accordingly. Plus, there's tuning by Dolby Audio, but one can't really discern the difference these features make - they can't be turned on and off - except to say that the sound is significantly louder, with a pleasantly wide soundstage. Even though its plenty loud for most mid-sized rooms, you can pair two Echo speakers for a much wider and better stereo-separated experience on your Fire- TV-connected TV.

BUCHAREST, Romania - Romanian voters cast ballots Sunday in a legislative election that many hope will restore some stability in one of the poorest European Union nations after five years of political and social turmoil.
 More than 18 million Romanians are registered to vote for a new national parliament but turnout is expected to be low due to voters’ fears about becoming infected with coronavirus.
 According to most pre-election polls, the centre-right National Liberal Party, known by its Romanian acronym PNL, is expected to become the largest party in the 465-seat bicameral parliament with over 30% support. Still, that would fall short of a governing majority. Analysts predict the party will seek to create a governing coalition with the progressive USR-Plus alliance, which is forecast to capture around 20% of the vote.
 The PNL has controlled Romania’s minority government since last October when its main rival, the left-leaning, populist Social Democrat Party, lost a confidence vote in the parliament amid massive protests over widespread corruption and heavy criticism from Brussels over the Social Democrats' attacks on the judiciary.
 Still, the Social Democrats remained the strongest party in the parliament and have spent the past year obstructing the minority cabinet’s efforts to contain the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. The Social Democrats are popular among Romania’s rural voters and are expected to win over 20% of the vote.
 To date, Romania has confirmed over half a million virus cases, with more than 12,000 deaths — and the country's outbreak is growing. Almost two-thirds of the confirmed cases and nearly a half of all virus-related deaths have been in the past two months.

 Penn State (2-5, 2-5 Big Ten) dominated both sides of the ball, outgained Rutgers 381-204 and held the Scarlet Knights to a season-low for points. The win was the second straight for the Nittany Lions and their 14th in a row over the Scarlet Knights (2-5, 2-5).
 “This program is not a losing program, this is not who we are,” said Clifford, who was 15 of 22 for 133 yards and an interception on a cold, windy day. “We had a rough start and a lot of things factor into that, but we know that we’re not a losing program. We didn’t come here to lose. It’s just getting back to ourselves. It was five weeks in a row that we were completely out of whack.”

PCAP is among several programs under the umbrella of Triumph, which provides outpatient and residential substance use disorder and mental health treatment, according to its website, www.triumphtx.org. Triumph also offers resources for women, men, children and people experiencing homelessness.
 A three-year intervention program, PCAP works with women who experience substance use disorder during pregnancy, helping them have healthier future pregnancies. It helps mothers complete substance use disorder treatment, stay in recovery and choose effective family planning methods, the website says.
 “At Christmas, our moms are hoping for gifts for their kiddos, but there are always household things that moms need just getting out of treatment,” said Kim Hitchcock, clinical supervisor.
 And though the program is for mothers, “We also work with men, single dads. Last year we also made sure a single dad got some gifts for his kiddos,” she said.
 For several years, LaShaunda Harris was the force behind Season of Sharing, gathering stories about young parents in need and what they hoped to get in donations from the community. As a mother who had faced her own challenges and surmounted them, Harris not only encouraged women to participate in PCAP but also supported them in the program as clinical supervisor, and offered personal guidance.
 Harris died at age 48 in May 2019. But with her help and that of others in the program, women beat addiction, escape domestic violence and rejoin life with their children in stable housing. They reclaim their lives, their self-
 esteem and their future.
 They also get their GEDs and jobs, and some earn college degrees. When Sharekia McKechnie ends winter quarter at Yakima Valley College, she will have an associate degree in business administration, with plans to continue for her bachelor’s degree in public health or human services.
 Many people have helped McKechnie on her journey, but Harris will always have a special place in her heart.
 “I finally had found someone to relate to who looked like me,” said McKechnie, who graduated from PCAP almost two years ago.
 McKechnie was 26 when she moved to Yakima from Seattle on Jan. 25, 2016, specifically for treatment at Triumph. She had been homeless, living in a stolen car in Seattle, and didn’t know anyone in Yakima when she started a six-month addiction treatment program. She completed that and moved into different Triumph housing options before getting her own place in November 2017.
 She learned how to drive and got her driver’s license and GED. She also began visitation with one of her four sons, who was 2 ½ at the time. She had lost custody of him when he was an infant because of her drug use, she said, but has since regained custody of him and his younger brother. They’re 6 and 4, and have received Christmas gifts through Season of Sharing — but this Christmas will be different.
 “I have presents for them I actually paid for. I’m super excited to be able to do this for them. This is the first year I’ve actually had money” to buy them presents, said McKechnie, who works at Ross and also attends recovery meetings along with taking college classes, raising her two youngest boys and home- schooling them because of the pandemic.
 “It’s just crazy, how my world changed,” she said. “I could not have even predicted this.”
 The Parent-Child Assistance Program is a long-term University of Washington human research program under the umbrella of Triumph, formerly known as Triumph Treatment Services, Hitchcock said. She appreciates the university’s leadership and strong support, which has continued during the pandemic.
 Yakima, one of several PCAP sites in Washington, is the third longest- operating program in the state and one of the largest, Hitchcock said. It has spots for 109 mothers, and 99 are enrolled, Hitchcock said. That number changes often as clients graduate from the program and others begin.
 Anyone can refer a mother for PCAP — other programs, a friend of a friend, a person who graduated from the program. Self-referrals are also an option, and staff members make presentations to help spread the word.
 “They have to have used while pregnant. It doesn’t matter what they’ve used, doesn’t matter how much,” she said. “They have to have used substances.”
 The program has great outcomes, Hitchcock said. For example, only 12% of mothers enrolled in PCAP had another drug- or alcohol-exposed infant within three years. In comparison, 21% of mothers over a similar period who received typical substance abuse treatment without such intense intervention had a subsequent drug- or alcohol-
 exposed baby, according to program statistics.
 “The University of Washington has been tracking this for 30 years. We prevent a subsequent exposed birth and we work with women on anything a woman wants to work on,” Hitchcock said. “That’s been our big aim — just trying to keep life as painless as possible for our families that are already having things kind of hard.
 “Yakima PCAP has a great history of getting women their GED, going on to get a college education, whether an (associate’s) or bachelor’s degree, getting women into the trades.”
 It’s not easy, McKechnie said, but the work is worth it.
 “Nothing is going to be given to you,” she said. “There’s steps to the bigger picture you want, so paint it.”
 And no matter what happens in the three years that clients participate in the program, “we don’t ever give up on the women,” Hitchcock said.
 “Women can make mistakes and not remain in recovery and we stay with them no matter what,” she said. “We never kick people out. It’s a fundamental big difference in how we operate — we don’t give up on them.”

Seeking votes for the party candidates, Ms. Irani said it was the BJP which is facilitating the maiden DDC elections in J&K as its goal is the welfare of the commoners.
 Addressing separate election rallies in different parts of Reasi district, Mr. Thakur, who is BJP’s in-charge of DDC elections in J&K and camping here, said the Gupkar gang is facing an existential crisis .
 The Gupkar gang is disconnected from ground realities and should look beyond their palatial estates to see the winds of change in J&K. Their attempts to bully, attack and disrupt the democratic process have met with stiff opposition from the common people of J&K, who want to oust the Gupkar gang once and for all, he said.
 The Union Minister of State for Finance expressed satisfaction over the turnout in the first three phases of the DDC elections and said “previously we have seen how they (PAGD) discouraged citizens from participating in the electoral process.”
 “They created an atmosphere of fear. The voting percentage was barely 3-5% and today the Kashmir region gets 35-40% voter turnout. This is because people are fed up and reposing their faith in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s politics of hope and development for J&K,” he said.
 “Their politics of hate and harbouring separatists is over, the frustration of the Gupkar gang is at their peak,” he said.
 He said the BJP believes in the politics of development for all, decisive action and democracy.
 “We will bring employment and entrepreneurship to the youth, we will bring investment and innovation for businesses and we will propel local produce of farmers and artisans to the global level so that the region reaps economic benefits,” Mr. Thakur said.
 Hitting back at the BJP over its tirade against the PAGD leaders, National Conference provincial president Devender Singh Rana said, “Their performance card is blank and they cannot talk about what they have done in the last six years, so they are harping on the issues which do not pertain to the development of the panchayats.”
 “Let them come out with a white paper on the development undertaken and jobs provided to the educated unemployed youth in the past six years,” Mr. Rana said, adding the BJP cannot get away from answering to the people, as they feel let down, degraded, humiliated and left in the lurch during the past six years.
 “The promises made were never kept and, in fact, the normal course of development was also put in the rear gear, as the self-centered agenda remained the top priority,” he said.
 “The insult to the injury is that the BJP is again hoodwinking the people by emotive slogans, forgetting its role on the administrative and developmental front. This is brazen and speaks of the hypocrisy that is core of the BJP,” he added.

WASHINGTON - A new report by a National Academy of Sciences committee has found that “directed” microwave radiation is the likely cause of illnesses among American diplomats in Cuba and China.
 The study commissioned by the State Department and released Saturday is the latest attempt to find a cause for the mysterious illnesses that started to emerge in late 2016 among U.S. personnel in Havana.
 The study found that “directed, pulsed radio frequency energy appears to be the most plausible” explanation for symptoms that included intense head pressure, dizziness and cognitive difficulties. It found this explanation was more likely than other previously considered causes such as tropical disease or psychological issues. The study did not name a source for the energy and did not say it came as the result of an attack, though it did note that previous research on this type of injury was done in the former Soviet Union.
 In its report, the 19-member committee noted that it faced significant challenges in trying to get to the bottom of the medical mystery. Among them, not everyone reported the same symptoms and the National Academy of Sciences research did not have access to all the previous studies on the illnesses, some of which are classified.
 “The committee found these cases quite concerning, in part because of the plausible role of directed, pulsed radiofrequency energy as a mechanism, but also because of the significant suffering and debility that has occurred in some of these individuals,” said committee chairman David Relman, a professor of medicine at Stanford University. “We as a nation need to address these specific cases as well as the possibility of future cases with a concerted, co-ordinated, and comprehensive approach.”

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates - The top U.S. Navy official in the Mideast said Sunday that America has reached an “uneasy deterrence” with Iran after months of regional attacks and seizures at sea, even as tensions remain high between Washington and Tehran over the Islamic Republic’s nuclear program.
 Vice Adm. Sam Paparo, who oversees the Navy’s 5th Fleet based in Bahrain, struck an academic tone in comments to the annual Manama Dialogue hosted by the International Institute for Strategic Studies. He described having a “healthy respect” for both Iran’s regular navy and the naval forces of its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.
 “We have achieved an uneasy deterrence. That uneasy deterrence is exacerbated by world events and by events along the way,” the vice-admiral said. “But I have found Iranian activity at sea to be cautious and circumspect and respectful, to not risk unnecessary miscalculation or escalation at sea.”
 Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
 While Iran has not directly seized or targeted a tanker in recent months, a mine recently struck an oil tanker off Saudi Arabia and a cargo ship near Yemen came under assault. Suspicion immediately fell on Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthi rebels for being behind both attacks. The Houthis have not commented on either attack.
 Paparo, a former Navy fighter pilot who most recently served as director of operations at the U.S. military's Central Command, offered a different stance than his immediate predecessor, Vice Adm. James Malloy. In one of his last comments to journalists in August, Malloy referred to Iran as “reckless and provocative” and always trying in dramatic naval drills to “lower the denominator until they’re sure that they can look like they’ve won something.”
 Malloy’s tenure saw oil tankers seized by Iran and a series of limpet mine explosions targeting tankers that the Navy blamed on Iran. Tehran denied being involved, though Revolutionary Guard members were filmed taking an unexploded mine away from one tanker.
 By contrast, the several months that Paparo’s been in charge have not seen any major crises.

(CNN) - A middle school shop teacher from New Jersey is being honored with a special edition Mazda for stepping up during the COVID-19 pandemic to produce thousands of masks for frontline workers.Jason Erdreich, 26, knows how to work with his hands since he teaches woodworking, manufacturing and robotics at Madison Junior School in Madison, New Jersey. So, when personal protective equipment was in short supply with the coronavirus spreading across the U.S., he felt he could help.He set up 15 3D printers in his living room, turning it into a makeshift factory, and started printing masks around the clock.When PPE was in short supply with the coronavirus spreading across the U.S., 26-year-old Jason Erdreich, a middle school shop teacher, stepped up, helping to produce more than 12,000 pieces of vital equipment for frontline workers.“I mean I had to,” Erdreich told CNN. “I had the resources to help, I was able to help, I couldn’t not help others that were doing so much to help us. Frontline workers were, and are, doing so much to care for us. Someone needs to make sure they are taken care of, too. I’m glad I was able to contribute to that.”He also taught others what he knew, and together, they produced more than 12,000 pieces of PPE for hospitals, nursing homes and frontline workers.Now, Erdreich is one of 50 people Mazda is honoring with an MX-5 Miata 100th Anniversary Special Edition.“This has been a truly incredible experience. I feel very fortunate, and I am endlessly appreciative to my colleagues, students, administrators, community members and my wife that really helped make all of the PPE in the thick of the pandemic – and even more so for the frontline workers we were making the PPE for,” he said.Copyright 2020 CNN Newsource.
