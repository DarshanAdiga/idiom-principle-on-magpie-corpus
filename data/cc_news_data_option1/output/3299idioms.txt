Springville head coach Michael Graben said he likes what he has seen from his players in practice so far, and they are equally as excited to get back onto the playing field.


  The Tigers had several individuals miss time during the 2019 season due to injuries. Graben said he hopes regaining those players will be a Springville strength for 2020.


  “We only played with three linebackers (last season) and we had our first four linebackers out for about four games last year,” said Graben. “So, all of those guys are back, and we’re excited about them.”


  Last fall was the first time Springville defeated SCCHS in over 10 years, according to Graben. He said he looks forward to continuing to improve the Tigers’ record and building off of their energy from 2019 despite the challenges the team has faced due to the global pandemic.


  “We had high expectations until COVID hit,” said Graben. “I'll be honest, it's hard to go out there and just put your heart and soul into something when you don't even know what you're going to get to play.”


  Graben emphasized that while winning is important, he is just excited about the opportunity for his team to play again.


  “Our kids need football,” said Graben.


  Kickoff is set for 7 p.m. Ticket sales are limited, and all spectators will be required to wear face masks and abide by social distancing guidelines.

DANVILLE — Danville District 118’s student registration for the new school year has been in full swing since last month, yet administrators are wondering where all the students are.


  Superintendent Alicia Geddis told the school board Wednesday night that only 3,470 students have registered either online or in-person so far. Last year the district’s total enrollment was 5,804. That leaves more than 2,300 students unaccounted for, she said.


  As of Wednesday night, 1,222 students in prekindergarten through fourth grade and 2,023 fifth- through 12th-graders had registered. The parents of another 225 students had picked up registration packets but hadn’t turned them in yet, she said.


  “This is alarming,” Geddis said. “We can’t plan classes or class sizes. We can’t plan staffing.


  “In order for us to support you, you have to register,” she added.


  Geddis said she wants parents to know that “staying at home is different than homeschooling and remote learning from home.”


  She said she understands that some parents are feeling frustrated about the district’s reopening plans that include fifth through 12th graders participating in all-remote learning, and kindergarten through fourth-grade students choosing either blended learning for three hours of in-person instruction during either a morning or an afternoon session Monday through Friday or all-remote learning.


  “We need these children in school,” Geddis said.


  Board member Darlene Halloran pleaded for the district’s parents to have patience.


  “If you have a question, don’t go on Facebook,” she said. “Call the administrators and go to the source for information.”


  Also on Wednesday, the board:


  • Approved a plan to refinance the district’s debt.


  Because of the current low interest rates, the district will realize a cost savings of $2.4 million over the remaining 10 years of a 2011 bond it sold to fund the renovations of North Ridge Middle, South View Upper Elementary and Mark Denman Elementary schools.


  The board approved issuing general obligation bonds not to exceed $10.5 million for the purpose of refunding the district’s outstanding bonds from 2011 and levying an annual tax sufficient to pay the principal and interest on them.


  “The bonds will be sold next week,” Business Director Narcissus Rankin said.


  Refinancing will help to lower the interest amount the district pays on the bonds, therefore lowering the tax rate levied on property owners in the district.


  The refinancing plan will lower the district’s tax rate by .20 per $100 EAV (equalized assessed valuation). The bond and interest rate would decline to .65 from .85 from the 2020 levy, which is payable in 2021.

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Andrew Wheeler and Boy Scouts of America (BSA) CEO and President Roger C. Mosby signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to collaborate on the creation of an EPA/BSA merit badge to be awarded as part of a new environmental education awards and recognition program.


  “I was an Eagle Scout growing up in Ohio, and I can definitely say scouting is where I learned to love the environment,” said EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler. “This award program challenges Scouts to earn multiple environment- related merit badges in the areas of animal study, outdoor activity, Earth science, and Public Health, and increases awareness of EPA’s accomplishments during its first 50 years.”


  “Since the very beginning of the Boy Scouts of America, conservation and environmental studies have been an integral part of our program. Scouts have provided service to their communities and to our country by helping to conserve wildlife, energy, forests, soil and water,” said Boy Scouts of America President and CEO Roger C. Mosby. “We are proud to sign the first-ever Memorandum of Understanding with the Environmental Protection Agency so that we can continue to challenge and empower Scouts to learn more about and care for the world around them.”


  “For 110 years, the Boy Scouts of America have used the outdoors as a classroom to educate youth and adults on the importance of being good stewards of our natural resources. This partnership with the Environmental Protection Agency will have a positive impact on thousands of youth and our environment," said Boy Scouts of America National Capital Area Council Scout Executive & CEO Craig Poland.

Football stadiums on Friday nights in towns across the great state of Texas are the home of one of the most revered institutions in history. Friday night football is as sacred as it gets. No matter whether it's a small town in rural Texas or a Metroplex school district, the ritual is the same.


   


  The question that looms over the horizon is whether the coronavirus pandemic will put a halt to this decades-long institution.


   


  The University Interscholastic League (UIL) suspended all 2020 spring sports and activities on March 19. During the summer, there have been very restrictive and selective sports-related activities allowed by the UIL.


   


  However, in late July, the UIL released the fall sports calendar for classes 1A-4A and a separate calendar for classes 5A and 6A.


   


  The lower divisions were able to begin Aug. 3 with the traditional training and conditioning that leads to helmets (no pads), and then full pad practices, which culminate in one week of scrimmages Aug. 20-22.


   


  Similarly, the 5A and 6A divisions were allowed to begin two hours per day of sport-specific training and conditioning Aug. 3 and follow a similar progression as the lower classes beginning Sept. 7, which will end with scrimmages Sept.17-19.


   


  Week one of the regular season is scheduled to begin Aug. 27-29 for class 1A-4A and Sept. 24-26 for class 5A and 6A.


   


  There is no doubt that players, coaches and support personnel will be pouring everything they have toward the success of the season.


   


  The general consensus among coaches and administrators is that the UIL has put protocols in place and each school has added its own additional levels of safety protocols to make sure that all precautions are taken.


   


  Melissa High School head football coach Matt Nally commented, "It's difficult for sure. We have followed protocols and we are constantly cleaning. All of the coaching staff and players are taking ownership of doing things the right way. Keeping the kids safe is top priority.


   


  "When we have staff meetings now they begin with COVID-19 protocols. Any other season, we would be talking schemes, personnel and other ordinary football process issues getting ready for the season. The idea of making sure we are on top of the COVID-19 issue is a priority. The main thing we are focusing on is to help the kids get back to normal. That includes socially, academically and athletically. It's definitely different."


   


  Things aren't much different at Anna High School, where head football coach Jason Heath and his staff have the Coyotes in full swing preparing for the upcoming season.


   


  According to Heath, "We are finding that the players and staff have all acclimated themselves to the protocols set forth by the UIL. Temperature checks, symptoms checks, mask usage, hand sanitizing and locker room sanitizing are all daily routines."


   


  When asked about the possibility of the UIL following suit with the Power 5 schools that have canceled their season, he noted, "As long as the collegiate programs like the Big 12, SEC and ACC are still moving forward with the season, there is less chance that the UIL will change its mind on the 2020 season.


   


  "The kids are much better off being a part of fall athletics and being around the environment it offers with direction, discipline and as much `new normal' as is possible."


   


  Anna, much like the other schools in the area, is eager to get started with the regular season. When asked about his team's progress so far, Heath added, "We are working hard. The players are improving and getting locked in and ready to move forward."


   


  Mark Humble, head coach at Rock Hill High School in Prosper, noted that the Blue Hawks are following UIL protocols.


   


  "The kids have been dialed in ever since the summer weight training and conditioning. It is part of the routine and with the players having been in school for the last three days the same procedures are being followed campus- wide," Humble said.


   


  "Football and all of the fall sports brings the community together. Maybe this will help get everyone united on regaining something normal in their daily routine. The athletes thrive on the routine and structure."


   


  Brandon Schmidt, head coach for the Prosper High School Eagles, was in agreement with the other area coaches as far as UIL protocols and moving forward toward the 2020 season.


   


  "I'm confident that with the success Class 1A-4A schools have had so far in working within the protocols and getting things rolling, (it) is very encouraging for bigger schools who are starting a little later based on the UIL calendar," he said.


   


  Schmidt is also in lockstep agreement with area coaches as far as the return to the normal routine of fall football being important for kids. "Structure, challenges, routines, discipline and socializing give the kids what they need the most. It's what we are used to doing this time of the year."


   


  Most noted is the abundance of communication between area head coaches and their staffs. Whether they have specifically spoken each other or not, it appears that the football programs from the area are locked in on doing the very best they can for their schools and their communities.

FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. (AP) — Falcons strong safety Keanu Neal knew he faced a tough task after tearing his Achilles in Week 3 last year.


  Neal had missed 15 games the season before with a torn knee ligament, so the heel injury meant he would face another long road back to the field.


  “Just getting hurt again and not being with the guys — that was the hardest part for me,” he said Wednesday. “You put in so much work to get back and then the season gets taken away from you again. That was by far the hardest part, not being able to play with the guys and be out there with the team and contribute the way I can.”


  The most recent time Neal played a full season, in 2017, he made the Pro Bowl. Atlanta coach Dan Quinn believes Neal, whom he drafted 17th overall out of Florida in 2016, is as good as new.


  Not only has Neal dropped 12 pounds to get to 212, the same weight he had as a rookie; Quinn says he also has the same quickness he had in his first season. The Falcons are hoping Neal can return to his productive ways. He racked up a combined 222 tackles, 15 pass breakups, eight forced fumbles and three fumble recoveries in his two full seasons.


  “From a physical standpoint, he does not look like a player who had these two significant setbacks,” Quinn said. “I think it speaks to the work that he put in."

For more than 50 years, L.Q. Jones was a familiar supporting character actor in some 100 films and hundreds more television shows. Lanky, tough and athletic, Jones could tackle any role although was often cast as the "heavy" in westerns and dramas, projecting the "bad guy" image with merely a sinister smirk or a menacing twinkle in the eye.      Born and raised in Texas as Justus McQueen, relatives took care of the young boy after his mother was killed in a car accident.      "I was born in Beaumont, although they may try to disclaim me, but it's too late now!" says Jones, who turned 93 on Aug. 19. "We moved around quite a bit, to Houston to Dallas to Oklahoma City, back to Beaumont, and finally Port Neches. I had a horse by the time I was 8 or 9 and grew up around tough rodeo people - my uncle was into roping - so westerns were easy and fun."      In college, at the University of Texas at Austin, his roommate for over a year was Fess Parker. While the future "Daniel Boone" actor moved west to Hollywood, McQueen headed south and took up ranching in Nicaragua. When Parker sent his buddy a copy of Leon Uris' war novel "Battle Cry," about to be filmed, McQueen thought one character could be his ticket to Hollywood.      "Fess encouraged me to come out and drew me a map on the back of a laundry shirt stuffing showing how to get to the studio. Within two days of arriving, I had the part of L.Q. Jones in 'Battle Cry' and probably would never have been in the business had it not been for Fess."      Despite lacking Hollywood experience, McQueen had worked some comedy acts during college to help pay the bills, so he took to playing the comic relief character in the 1955 war drama to act like a veteran. Adopting his screen character's name as his own, the lad from Texas quickly settled into Hollywood.      Jones was cast in Sam Peckinpah's "The Wild Bunch," having become a favorite among the director's casting repertoire. "Sam was a genius and I loved him, but he was a basket case. He drove everybody nuts."      That was evident during the production of "Major Dundee" with Charlton Heston.      "Heston was using a real saber for one scene," he recalled. "Sam made him so mad, Chuck came within an eyelash of cutting Sam in two - and it scared Chuck because he damn near did it. Sam found a way to get under your skin to get what he wanted out of you."      While Jones calls "The Wild Bunch" a "hell of a movie," he says Peckinpah's "'Ride the High Country' was the best Sam ever made, just gorgeous to watch, although I cry like a baby at the ending." Jones is a member of a ruthless family that tackles Joel McCrea and Randolph Scott as they attempt to rescue Mariette Hartley.      "Joel was the best human being I ever met and Randy wasn't far behind him, so the two of them together make one of the best Saturday afternoon westerns you could ever sit and watch over a bowl of popcorn."      While he had a few lead film roles, Jones says he enjoyed his supporting roles and went after every job he could. But there was one he missed.      "I was at my agent's one day and the phone rang. It was Stanley Kubrick offering a part in 'Dr. Strangelove.' Well, I would have walked barefoot across the state to work with him, but when he was ready to shoot I was tied up with another picture. The role (of Major 'King' Kong) went to Slim Pickens. But thank goodness it did, could you imagine anyone else in that part?"      Jones appeared in movies with countless fellow character actors, not to mention big stars such as James Coburn, Audie Murphy, Steve McQueen, Clint Eastwood and Glenn Ford. He even appeared in three Elvis Presley films. But his first role in "Battle Cry" provided a valuable lesson.      "I had a hundred 'directors' \- lighting, sound, wardrobe people, all the crew helping out a rookie actor and everyone helping each other," says Jones. "You learn from them, work your butt off, and with a little luck have a successful career. I suppose I could have worked my way up the acting food chain, but character work was very rewarding and great fun. I loved playing the heavies because I could do what I wanted and got to work with the best in the business, so I consider myself very lucky."   Nick Thomas teaches at Auburn University at Montgomery, Alabama, and has written features, columns and interviews for more than 850 newspapers and magazines. The interview with Jones was conducted in 2017. See www.getnickt.org.

In his administrative report, Harrison-Clarksburg Health Department Administrator Chad Bundy outlined grants the health department has received.


  A Public Health Emergency Planning grant the department receives helps with personnel and planning for pandemics and mass immunizations, while a Public Health Emergency Response Grant is helping with pandemic response, he said.


  Epidemiological Laboratory Capacity grant funds will allow the department to hire two public health nurses and a sanitarian and provide funding for infrastructure capacity building at the department, he said.


  Funding received from the CARES Act through the Harrison County Commission will pay for expenses related to community COVID-19 testing events, according to Bundy.


  Some personnel changes are in the works at the department, Bundy said.


  Three retirees who returned to work full time for the department to assist during the pandemic are “at the end of where we can work with them and compensate them for this year,” Bundy said.

  # Medical center opening urgent care facility in September


  Staff Report


  COSHOCTON - Coshocton Regional Medical Center has announced plans to open a new urgent care facility in early September. An exact date has not been revealed but it will be located in Suite 2 of 406 S. 15th St., across from the hospital.


  Urgent care will specialize in low-cost walk-in visits seven days-a-week with extended hours. It will be able to care for patients after hours and on weekends when their doctor’s office is closed, providing an option for individuals that need to be seen by a medical provider and cannot wait until the next day or over a weekend.


  The clinic will also create an option for individuals to seek care that do not have an established primary care provider. Urgent care will provide a variety of services for patients with general illnesses and injuries, including on-site X-ray for breaks or fractures and on-site EKGs. Results of on-site X-rays and EKGs will be interpreted during the patient’s visit and a plan of care will be identified immediately.


  “There is a need in this community for care after hours and on weekends,” Stephanie Conn, CEO of the medical center, said in a press release. “Urgent care will provide patients another option for services that may not require a trip to the emergency room. We are very excited to provide the Coshocton community with this new option that is more flexible for patients’ schedules.”


  Coshocton Urgent Care will be open from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday to Friday and from noon to 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. No appointments will be necessary. Call the clinic for more information at 740-623-4440 or go to coshoctonhospital.org.


  Coshocton County has been without an urgent care facility providing such services since the closure of RapidCare. A Family Urgent Care outlet is also in the works to open within the next few months in the Downtowner Plaza.

Bacevich argues that “the era of US dominion has now passed.” Biden does not believe that. He really does regard the United States as the “indispensable nation,” in Madeleine Albright’s much-mocked formulation, and he tends to attract aides who do too. In an article in the _Atlantic_ last year, Jake Sullivan, another former national security official who now occupies a unique position as an advisor on both foreign and domestic policy, argued that, thanks to its capacity for self-renewal, its pragmatism, and its commitment to a doctrine of enlightened self-interest, the United States remains uniquely capable of world leadership, albeit in the more modest role of first among equals. In words guaranteed to vex the left, Sullivan called for “a new American exceptionalism” to restore the nation’s place atop the global order.

WEST HOMESTEAD, Pa (AP) — The doors to the AMC Waterfront 22 were locked. They had been for five months, along with most indoor theaters in the U.S. because of COVID-19. But in 20 minutes that was about to change and four people in masks were already gathered outside the theater 8 miles southeast of Pittsburgh in eager anticipation. They were there to see the Vin Diesel movie “Bloodshot” for 15 cents a ticket. After so many months, 20 extra minutes didn’t seem like all that long to wait.


  The lights started slowing coming back on in theaters nationwide Thursday with AMC Theaters, the country’s largest chain, leading the charge.


  AMC opened some 113 locations across the U.S., advertising retro pricing and retro screenings to entice audiences back to the movies. Regal, the second largest exhibitor, is following suit Friday. It's been a long-time coming for the beleaguered businesses, which had several false starts due to coronavirus spikes.


  When the doors at the West Homestead theater finally opened, masked employees stood in the lobby to greet patrons and help them navigate the new safety protocols inside, where masks are required (except when eating and drinking concessions) and the sick are asked to stay home. Pretty soon, the number of customers had doubled and in time there was a steady stream of people of all ages coming through the doors ready to experience the big screen again.


  “My son and I counted the days until it reopened. We love coming to the movies. That’s why we’re here,” said Betty Gallagher. “And today’s 15 cents, so that was another incentive.”


  The “1920s pricing” was a main draw for most of those early customers. One 58-year-old man, Jerome Heslin, said he hadn’t been to a theater in over 40 years, but the price got him back.

demconvention.com/watchPosted by Democratic National Convention on&nbsp;Thursday, August 20, 2020The positive focus expected Thursday night marks a break from the&nbsp;dire warnings offered by former President Barack Obama&nbsp;and others the night before. The 44th president of the United States warned that American democracy itself could falter if Trump is reelected, while Harris and 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton declared that Americans' lives and livelihoods are at risk.Throughout their convention, the Democrats have summoned a collective urgency about the dangers of Trump as president. In 2016, they dismissed and sometimes trivialized him. In the days leading up to Biden's acceptance speech, they cast him as an existential threat to the country.The tone signals anew that&nbsp;the fall campaign between Trump and Joe Biden, already expected to be among the most negative of the past half-century, will be filled with rancor and recrimination.Beyond Biden's highly anticipated speech, Thursday's program is designed to highlight the diversity of the Democratic Party and the nation he hopes to lead.Speakers include four former rivals: Pete Buttigieg, who was trying to become the nation’s first openly gay president; New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker; New York ultra-billionaire Michael Bloomberg and entrepreneur Andrew Yang. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms will also be featured in addition to Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth, who lost both legs while serving in Iraq.Biden’s Democratic Party has sought this week to put forward a cohesive vision of values and policy priorities, highlighting efforts to combat climate change, tighten gun laws and embrace a humane immigration policy. They have drawn a sharp contrast with Trump’s policies and personality, portraying him as cruel, self-centered and woefully unprepared to manage virtually any of the nation’s mounting crises and policy challenges.It's unclear if tearing down Trump will be enough to propel Biden to victory in November.Just 75 days before the election, the former vice president must energize the disparate factions that make up the modern Democratic Party — a coalition that spans generation, race and ideology. And this fall voters must deal with concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic that has created health risks for those who want to vote in person — and postal slowdowns for mail-in ballots, which Democrats blame on Trump.The pandemic has also forced Biden’s team to abandon the typical pageantry and rely instead on a&nbsp;highly-produced, all-virtual affair&nbsp;that has failed to draw the same television ratings as past conventions.The silence was noticeable Wednesday night, for example, as Harris took the stage to make history in a cavernous hall inside the Chase Center in downtown Wilmington. She was flanked by American flags but no family, and her audience consisted of a few dozen reporters and photographers.It’s Trump’s turn next. The Republican president, who abandoned plans to host his convention in North Carolina and in Florida, is expected to break tradition and accept his nomination from the White House lawn next week.In the meantime, he’s seeking to take attention from Biden. Trump was continuing this week’s swing-state tour on Thursday with&nbsp;a stop near Biden’s birthplace of Scranton, Pennsylvania. While he is trying to stay on offense, the president has faced a series of distractions of his own this week, many of his own making.Trump on Wednesday praised a conspiracy-theory group that believes the president's political opponents support satanism and pedophilia. On Thursday, a federal judge ruled that prosecutors could access his long-hidden tax returns. Also Thursday, New York prosecutors announced the indictment of Steve Bannon, Trump's former campaign manager and White House chief counsel, who was charged with fraud.Biden adviser Symone Sanders welcomed Trump's attempt to troll Biden by campaigning in Pennsylvania.“We actually appreciate President Trump going out there because the American people will get to see a tale of two presidents tonight,” Sanders said. “You will see Donald Trump doing what he always does, talking about himself. ... You will see Vice President Biden tonight talking about the American people, talking about his vision for the future, being hopeful and upbeat.”The night before, Harris,&nbsp;a 55-year-old California senator&nbsp;and the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, addressed race and equality in a personal way Biden cannot&nbsp;when he formally accepts his party's presidential nomination.“There is no vaccine for racism. We have got to do the work,” Harris declared.“We’ve got to do the work to fulfill the promise of equal justice under law,” she added. “None of us are free until all of us are free.”Obama, another barrier breaker, called Biden his brother before pleading with voters to vote, to “embrace your own responsibility as citizens — to make sure that the basic tenets of our democracy endure. Because that’s what is at stake right now. Our democracy.”Beyond the carefully scripted confines of the virtual convention, there have been modest signs of tension between the moderate and progressive wings of Biden’s Democratic Party.In particular, some progressives complained that pro-Biden Republicans such as Ohio Gov. John Kasich have been featured more prominently than the party’s younger progressive stars like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez.___Peoples reported from New York.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.",

Yu Pei-chen, a retired major general who was a commander of the 542th Armor Brigade, speculates that Huang may have been caught in a Catch-22 situation in which he could not request replacements “by the book” because too many things in his depot were already broken or missing when he was assigned there. If he gave a truthful report, the system might demand that he replace the parts personally at inflated “army prices” which can reach astronomical sums. The process for getting the items replaced without paying himself, according to Yu, would be absurdly bureaucratic, require begging forgiveness from superiors, and would probably be unknown to an inexperienced officer. His superior officers in the brigade might also frown on him for triggering an investigation from the top. Instead of faking paperwork to cover up the shortfalls, as the officers before him may have done, he probably tried to cover the missing items himself, Yu explained.

What would it mean to rally democracies without fighting a new cold war, and without pretending to the status of undisputed leadership the United States had 70 years ago? The first order of business, as Biden notes in his _Foreign Affairs_ essay, is “renewing democracy at home”—ending the assault on immigrants, minorities, public servants, and all the other targets of President Donald Trump’s nationalist abuse. This is one problem that Truman did not face, yet the Cold War liberals of his day, such as Hubert Humphrey, also recognized that the United States could not serve as a credible defender of democratic values unless it conspicuously practiced them at home, in their case by passing civil rights legislation and offering a generous welcome to displaced persons. Domestic reform thus enables reform abroad.

Legion’s use of the old College World Series tournament format adds a game for the winner of the winners bracket final when it would ordinarily advance to the championship round to await the survivor of the losers bracket. Bryant was set to play for the title before taking on Paducah and, with a win, would’ve needed to be beaten twice on Tuesday but, as it was, they were able to watch Paducah and League City fight it out in an earlier game on Tuesday before taking on the survivor that night for all the marbles.

  Posted by Democratic National Convention on Thursday, 20 August 2020


  The positive focus expected Thursday night marks a break from the dire warnings offered by former President Barack Obama and others the night before. The 44th president of the United States warned that American democracy itself could falter if Trump is reelected, while Harris and 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton declared that Americans' lives and livelihoods are at risk.


  Throughout their convention, the Democrats have summoned a collective urgency about the dangers of Trump as president. In 2016, they dismissed and sometimes trivialized him. In the days leading up to Biden's acceptance speech, they cast him as an existential threat to the country.


  The tone signals anew that the fall campaign between Trump and Joe Biden, already expected to be among the most negative of the past half-century, will be filled with rancor and recrimination.


  Beyond Biden's highly anticipated speech, Thursday's program is designed to highlight the diversity of the Democratic Party and the nation he hopes to lead.


  Speakers include four former rivals: Pete Buttigieg, who was trying to become the nation’s first openly gay president; New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker; New York ultra-billionaire Michael Bloomberg and entrepreneur Andrew Yang. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms will also be featured in addition to Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth, who lost both legs while serving in Iraq.


  Biden’s Democratic Party has sought this week to put forward a cohesive vision of values and policy priorities, highlighting efforts to combat climate change, tighten gun laws and embrace a humane immigration policy. They have drawn a sharp contrast with Trump’s policies and personality, portraying him as cruel, self-centered and woefully unprepared to manage virtually any of the nation’s mounting crises and policy challenges.


  It's unclear if tearing down Trump will be enough to propel Biden to victory in November.


  Just 75 days before the election, the former vice president must energize the disparate factions that make up the modern Democratic Party — a coalition that spans generation, race and ideology. And this fall voters must deal with concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic that has created health risks for those who want to vote in person — and postal slowdowns for mail-in ballots, which Democrats blame on Trump.


  The pandemic has also forced Biden’s team to abandon the typical pageantry and rely instead on a highly-produced, all-virtual affair that has failed to draw the same television ratings as past conventions.


  The silence was noticeable Wednesday night, for example, as Harris took the stage to make history in a cavernous hall inside the Chase Center in downtown Wilmington. She was flanked by American flags but no family, and her audience consisted of a few dozen reporters and photographers.


  It’s Trump’s turn next. The Republican president, who abandoned plans to host his convention in North Carolina and in Florida, is expected to break tradition and accept his nomination from the White House lawn next week.


  In the meantime, he’s seeking to take attention from Biden. Trump was continuing this week’s swing-state tour on Thursday with a stop near Biden’s birthplace of Scranton, Pennsylvania. While he is trying to stay on offense, the president has faced a series of distractions of his own this week, many of his own making.


  Trump on Wednesday praised a conspiracy-theory group that believes the president's political opponents support satanism and pedophilia. On Thursday, a federal judge ruled that prosecutors could access his long-hidden tax returns. Also Thursday, New York prosecutors announced the indictment of Steve Bannon, Trump's former campaign manager and White House chief counsel, who was charged with fraud.


  Biden adviser Symone Sanders welcomed Trump's attempt to troll Biden by campaigning in Pennsylvania.


  “We actually appreciate President Trump going out there because the American people will get to see a tale of two presidents tonight,” Sanders said. “You will see Donald Trump doing what he always does, talking about himself. ... You will see Vice President Biden tonight talking about the American people, talking about his vision for the future, being hopeful and upbeat.”


  The night before, Harris, a 55-year-old California senator and the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, addressed race and equality in a personal way Biden cannot when he formally accepts his party's presidential nomination.


  “There is no vaccine for racism. We have got to do the work,” Harris declared.


  “We’ve got to do the work to fulfill the promise of equal justice under law,” she added. “None of us are free until all of us are free.”


  Obama, another barrier breaker, called Biden his brother before pleading with voters to vote, to “embrace your own responsibility as citizens — to make sure that the basic tenets of our democracy endure. Because that’s what is at stake right now. Our democracy.”


  Beyond the carefully scripted confines of the virtual convention, there have been modest signs of tension between the moderate and progressive wings of Biden’s Democratic Party.


  In particular, some progressives complained that pro-Biden Republicans such as Ohio Gov. John Kasich have been featured more prominently than the party’s younger progressive stars like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

I'm unable to tell you what that choice is. We've given him some recommendations but we don't like to talk about it in public because we don't want people to feel bad.

Harvesting EXIF data in this way has actually been documented in the past when Shutterfly was caught doing it in 2019. This change will restrict the easiest path to hijacking location data, but it leaves some workarounds like calling out to camera apps directly or asking users to take photos and load them from a media provider. It's possible Google may have to take additional steps to completely shut the door on this tactic.
