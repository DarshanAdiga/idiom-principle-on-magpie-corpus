Chapters like “Petrification” illustrate a broader issue with _Cinemagritte_ : Fischer’s comparative approach does not allow for enough nuance or complexity to sustain a 250-page book. Her basic technique (discuss an element from a painting, mention a movie that contains the same object, theme, etc., summarize said movie) is repetitive not because she fails to dig deeply enough but because there simply isn’t much else to do with the material, given her analytical strategy; her visual associations are fundamentally intuitive and cannot be explained away. “‘If a picture could be explained in words,’” Fischer quotes Magritte, “‘words would suffice, and the picture would be superfluous’” (91). Perhaps she should have taken this advice more to heart.

LEE'S SUMMIT, Mo. (AP) — A Kansas City suburb that had divided by racial tension has elected the school district's first black school board member, giving her the most votes out of nine candidates. Megan Marshall, a retired Marine, was elected Tuesday to the Lee's Summit School Board with 21% of the vote, according to unofficial results, The Kansas City Star reported. The vote comes nearly a year after the largely-white district's first black superintendent, Dennis Carpenter, resigned in response to months of conflict with the board over his efforts to promote racial equity training in the district. The situation became so tense that at one point Carpenter was given police protection because of threats he received. The school board at first approved implementing Carpenter's equity plan but under pressure from many parents, rejected two attempts to hire a firm to lead the training. Marshall has two children attending Lee Summit schools and one who graduated last year.

AMC Theatres, the world's largest cinema chain said, today, that there is 'substantial doubt' it can remain in business after it has been ravaged by the global health crisis. The chain said that it expects to report next week that it lost between $2.1 billion and $2.4 billion in the first quarter, despite the fact that theaters were closed for only 2-3 weeks of the 13-week quarter. Revenues for the quarter were roughly $941.5 million, down 22% from $1.2 billion in the same quarter in 2019. Thus far, after nearly 5 weeks in the current (2nd) quarter, the company remains completely closed. Of no surprise to anyone, the company reported in their regulatory filing today that,"We are generating effectively no revenue."

Allowing children to participate in these youth activities is a way to get them active and outdoors. They are socialized and simply get to play together.
 "That's what recreation is all about — play," Cunningham said.
 As families consider enrolling, it is important to know that the ERC is going to take as many precautions as they can. Though restructuring — including seating in the stands — is still somewhat up in the air, it will get figured out as administration continues conversations with one another and families.
 Baseball and softball are the major programs currently being offered, and Cunningham anticipates that the later camps will be able to follow similar guidelines, though some of those restrictions may be lifted by mid-June and later. ERC is still up to date and abiding by the county's and state's health recommendations.
 For those who want to still be active without joining the ERC programs, Cunningham encourages utilizing the parks and other recreation facilities when they are open. The ballfields are open to the public.
 "Be active, have fun," he said.
 Online registration is heavily encouraged as much as possible to limit in- person contact for the safety and health of staff and patrons. Registration information can be found under the Sports tab at emporiarec.org. Each activity has a separate registration link. When logged into your account with the email used to open the account, youth fee waivers will be attached. For any assistance, contact office.emporiarec@emporiarec.org or call 341-6300.

This unusual year shows signs of becoming weirder yet. Reading Nathaniel Philbrick’s “Sea of Glory” about the little-known U.S. Exploring Expedition (or “Ex-Ex”) of 1836 reminded me how 1965 was a particularly strange year for me. That October my family moved from Texas to Vermont, where we were “the Kennedy killers” in the eyes of New Englanders still resentful of the President’s assassination; we arrived the week after a couple named Hill were abducted in neighboring New Hampshire by a UFO; the massive Northeastern power blackout occurred the following week; and I was expelled from school ten minutes into my first day for replying “yes ma’am” to a teacher who considered me sassy rather than Southern. Odder still, when I went home to tell my parents about the expulsion, they presented a book that arrived for me COD that day: a completely unsolicited copy of “The Hollow Earth” by Raymond Bernard, who claimed that, not only was the Earth hollow, it was where UFOs come from.
 This book, which I still own, was cheesy even by mid-60s standards of high- acid paper and stapled bindings, with blurred, grainy illustrations and a publisher's note saying, "We will not enter into any correspondence regarding this book. Whether you accept or reject the contents of this book is your privilege. No one cares." The author, "Bernard," was actually Walter Seigmeister, "an early 20th-century alternative health and esoteric writer and mystic who formed part of the alternative reality subculture," according to Wikipedia. He lived briefly in Ecuador with Johnny Lovewisdom (AKA "the Hermit Saint of the Andes") where they dabbled in unusual dietary practices, like "breatharianism" According to HowStuffWorks.com, the Breatharians answer for health problems was "stop eating. Or rather, live off prana, which is a Sanskrit word that translates to "life air" or "life force." Born John Weirlo in 1919, Lovewisdom lived beside an Ecuadoran crater lake he deemed safe from nuclear fallout. He was also pretty sure he was the reincarnation of Ananda, Buddha's main disciple. Lovewisdom invited him to visit upon learning about Seigmeister's "Dream to make a super-race who worship the sun."
 However, Seigmeister’s main interest was his hollow earth theory, and he was in good company, including Edmond “Comet” Halley. Halley’s dad bought him cutting-edge astronomical equipment when he entered Oxford in 1673, and three years and many astronomical papers later, Halley dropped out, sailed to St. Helena Island where he cataloged 341 Southern Hemisphere stars, figured out the size of the solar system and improved the sextant. Upon returning home he published a star catalog, so impressing King Charles II that he commanded Oxford to grant Halley a master’s degree, and the Royal Society (the leading group of natural philosophers, or proto-scientists) made him a member and employee at age 22.
 Halley soon argued with Society members Richard Hook and Christopher Wren about how to accurately measure planetary motion. They took their debate to Isaac Newton, who told them he’d figured it out earlier but couldn’t find his notes, but agreed to redo calculations. “Halley persuaded Newton to expand his studies and allow him to edit the work,” Wikipedia tells us, and, since the Royal Society had spent their book budget on “History of Fishes,” Halley paid all expenses for compiling and publishing Newton’s new work, “The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy” (or “the Principia,” as its Latin abbreviation is better known). The Society also announced they couldn’t pay Halley his £50 annual salary, but reimbursed him with unsold copies of the fish book.

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — To those who knew former Indiana University football player Chris Beaty, it was no surprise that he would participate in a protest over the death of George Floyd.


  That a man they saw as a “gentle giant” who brought positivity everywhere he went would turn up dead in an alley after a peaceful demonstration turned violent was unfathomable.


  “He promoted peace and understanding and love every way that he could,” said Michael Cranfill, a restaurant and craft beer taproom owner. “He is someone, I think, who would take every opportunity he could to bring people together.”


  Beaty’s body was found Saturday night not far from his apartment, one of two people fatally shot after violence erupted during an Indianapolis protest.


  The death of the man who was known as Mr. Indianapolis because of his unwavering support and enthusiasm for the city was just one of several in the U.S. during a week of protest and unrest since Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after the handcuffed black man stopped moving and pleading for air. Others slain include a Louisville, Kentucky, restaurant owner who was shot by authorities trying to disperse a crowd; a federal officer in Oakland, California, who was shot at a courthouse by someone in a passing vehicle; and a man shot outside a pawn shop in Minneapolis.


  Police in Indianapolis did not release details Tuesday of Beaty’s slaying.


  Arely Elrod said she met Beaty about a decade ago through mutual friends who would attend local events together.


  “He was so selfless and always so positive,” said Elrod, who owns a cleaning service. “He felt like there was always a need in a time of hatred. He was always the one to make sure he made a difference.”


  Beaty, 38, graduated from Indianapolis Cathedral High School and played defensive lineman at Indiana University from 2000 to 2004. Since then, he had become a business owner in Indianapolis.


  His family released a statement tanking the public for the support and love.


  _We have been overwhelmed with the outpouring of love and support for Chris since his murder over the weekend. It has not been a surprise because Chris lived and loved passionately every day of his 38 years on this earth. From his time at Cathedral, to his four years as a student-athlete at Indiana University, to his dedication to making Indianapolis a better place, down to his last moments when he put his life on the line & became a hero – Chris was someone who always put others before himself. He truly was one-of-a-kind, with a giant heart filled with love for everyone he met, consistently working to break down racial barriers._


   _We encourage everyone to live like Chris - to love others boldly, to stand up for what’s right, to live every day to the fullest. #LiveLikeChris_


   _For those wishing to continue Chris’ legacy, we have set up thisGoFundMe for donations in his memory to the Chris Beaty Memorial Scholarship Fund that will benefit Indiana University & Cathedral High School._


   _The Official Link for theChris Beaty Memorial GoFundMe _


  _Thank you for all of your kind words, support and love. Please continue to recall the stories from Chris’ life as they are constant reminders that will keep his memory alive._


   _More information to follow as we work through finalizing arrangements. #LiveLikeChris_


  “The news of the passing of Chris Beaty is just devastating,” Indiana head football coach Tom Allen said in a statement. “Since I returned home to coach at Indiana, Chris embraced me, encouraged me and supported me! His passion for life and Indiana Football energized me every time we were together.”


  The school said Beaty had been president of Fresh Marketing LLC. A May 4 post on Beaty’s Facebook page said that he and his team had created a reusable and washable cloth facemask with a filter for people to use during the coronavirus pandemic.


  “As the realization that life is changing set in from sitting on the couch during quarantine, I figured out a way to be proactive and help people during these COVID-19 times,” the post read. “If you’re going back to work and looking for a solution to your ‘new normal’ please keep us in mind.”


  Beaty also owned and operated nightclubs and recently sold some of his businesses, said Cranfill, who added that when he opened his own restaurant in downtown Indianapolis Beaty asked how they could work together to grow the community.


  “He was a gentle giant, the kind of guy that would just draw you in with his energy,” said Cranfill, 37. “He had the most amazing smile, would give you a big hug. He exuded care for his community — someone who brought everyone together.”


  Cranfill called Beaty a leader, not just for African Americans in the community, but for all of Indianapolis.


  “I prayed and said, ‘Let his memory be the unifying moment to stop this violence, for us to come together, lay down our differences and for people to begin to heal and hear each other,’” Cranfill said.

That will be followed by a two- game play-in matchup between the eight and nine seeds (if the ninth seed is within four games the team it's chasing) with the lower seed needing to win both.

 Derek Chauvin, who had his knee pressed into Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes, had previously been charged with third-degree murder and second- degree manslaughter. Officers Thomas Lane and J.A. Keung, who helped restrain Floyd, and a fourth officer, Tou Thao, who stood near the others, were not initially charged.

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, health officials encourage good hand hygiene, social distance, and routine cleaning and disinfecting. Considering data about how the highly contagious virus spreads, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recommends wearing a cloth face covering in public settings to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
   
 Dr. Chad Weston, MD, who practices family medicine at Novant Health Oceanside Family Medicine and Convenient Care in Shallotte, said while wearing masks -- including cloth masks -- can be uncomfortable and inconvenient, "knowing that everyone wearing a mask is demonstrating caring for their neighbor and community is the bigger benefit."
   
 1) Wearing a mask or a cloth face covering is about protecting others
   
 "Masking among everybody reduces the chance of spread," Weston said. "It isn't so much about protecting yourself as it is about protecting your communities, and it really is about being a part of something bigger than yourself. I'll see some folks that seem to think they are tough guys, but that may not always be the case. I don't think this virus necessarily discriminates in that regard. Regardless of how healthy a person may seem to be or feel that they are, there's still a chance of contracting it."
   
 According to CDC, the COVID-19 virus has been detected in people who show no symptoms. Therefore, health experts say wearing a mask or cloth face covering whether one has symptoms or not helps prevent spread of the virus.
   
 While research is ongoing to learn more about how the virus is transmitted whether through airborne transmission, droplet transmission or both, Weston said, "We advise everyone to wear masks to help themselves and more importantly to protect each other."
   
 2) Wearing masks reminds people not to touch parts of their face
   
 Health officials recommend avoiding touching yout face to help protect against infection. But scratching and touching is something many do numerous times throughout the day, often without noticing.
   
 "I think another big thing about masking is that it helps remind you not to put your hands on your face or itch your eyes, mess with your nose or mouth," Weston said. "Those kinds of behaviors over numerous times during the day and numerous contacts with surfaces that may have the virus on them increases the possibility of someone contracting the virus."
   
 3) Washing hands frequently is more effective than wearing gloves
   
 Some people who wear masks are also wearing gloves to try to protect themselves. Weston said he worries this can have the opposite effect.
   
 "I really don't see the value of wearing gloves; if anything, I see it as more of a detriment because people are less likely to wash their hands while wearing gloves," he said. "And the thing is, within minutes they cross contaminate themselves by touching something with gloves. Rarely will people maintain a sterile field while wearing gloves; so, it kind of defeats the purpose. I'd rather them not wear gloves and wash their hands 10 times more frequently."
   
 4) Be careful taking masks on and off to help reduce the risk of infection
   
 Taking a mask on and off throughout the day without proper hand hygiene can pose issues.
   
 "The more you take it on and off the greater the probability of your hands contaminating the mask and your hand coming in contact with your face," Weston said.
   
 When it is time to remove one's mask, Weston said, one should wash your hands before taking the mask off, remove the mask, and then wash your hands again.
   
 Weston said if while driving around one wants to take your mask off between stops, utilize hand sanitizer when you can't wash your hands.
   
 "I see people driving down the road with mask on in their vehicle. I don't know if that's critical, but if while you're driving in your car, and you're able to do a simple (hand) hygiene technique like using hand sanitizer, and then remove your mask, and then use hand sanitizer again when you put the mask back on, it reduces the chances of contaminating something that's sitting up against the face," he said.
   
 Some pull masks down while interacting with others, but Weston said removing one's mask to speak to others or wearing the mask around one's neck defeats the purpose.
   
 "The whole point is to create an additional two-way barrier between the air circulating and your respiratory tract," he said.
   
 5) Wearing a mask doesn't replace other pro-active safety measures
   
 According to the CDC, people should wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth while out in public, and emphasizes that this is an additional public health measure to reduce the spread of COVID-19 that should be used in addition to -- not instead of -- other measures such as social distancing, frequent hand cleaning, and other preventative actions.
   
 Facial covers such as cloth masks are recommended for the public in order to help reserve surgical masks and N-95 respirators for health care workers and first-responders.

After years of hearing her skin looked fine, Brenda Hornickle was surprised this spring when Dr. Marci Pepine recommended biopsies on a couple of suspicious-looking areas.
   
 One near her eyebrow was benign. Another, on her neck, wasn't.
   
 Another surprise was in store for the Lakeland resident:
   
 She could choose between having the squamous cell skin cancer removed surgically or by "superficial" radiation therapy.
   
 X-ray beams used in that type of radiation treat the cancer on the skin but don't go deep into the tissue below.
   
 Hornickle, 63, chose radiation.
   
 "It's not in a great place, not a nice flat surface," Hornickle said of her skin cancer, explaining that she didn't want a large incision, risk of scarring or risk of possible infection.
   
 She and her husband, Larry Lawrence, run together most days.
   
 Hornickle was concerned that motion while running might irritate an incision. She had found tending to the biopsied area "annoying."
   
 The radiation goes 5 millimeters deep, isn't painful and is "an excellent therapy for anyone over 60 with comorbidities" such as poor wound healing, Pepine said.
   
 Radiation as an alternative to surgery for some patients was offered by 40 percent to 50 percent of dermatologists in the 1970s, she said.
   
 It fell out of favor as Mohs surgery, an alternative to standard removal surgery, became increasingly available.
   
 In Mohs, thin layers of the cancer-containing skin are removed and examined. Mohs surgery allows less skin to be removed.
   
 But now, years later, some dermatologists are making room for radiation in their repertoire.
   
 "I'm thrilled to be able to offer it," said Pepine, who added it to her solo Lakeland dermatology practice in April.
   
 "It's great for ears, nose, around the eyes and mouth."
   
 There are a couple of reasons for the renewed interest, said Dr. Basil Cherpelis, professor of dermatology at the University of South Florida Health Morsani College of Medicine.
   
 The machines are small enough to be put in one room of a medical practice, he said, and Medicare revised reimbursement codes to make payment more appropriate.
   
 The American Society for Radiation Oncology released clinical practice guidelines in December for when and how superficial radiation should be used on patients with basal or squamous cell skin cancers.
   
 They strongly recommend its use for patients with those cancers who either can't have or decline to have surgery.
   
 They conditionally recommend it for patients whose cancer is in "anatomically sensitive areas such as the nose or lips where surgery could compromise function or cosmetic outcomes."
   
 Basal and squamous cell skin cancers are more than 90 percent of skin cancers diagnosed.
   
 American Academy of Dermatology guidelines say surgical management is the most effective treatment. Its guidelines consider radiation a secondary option for treating those cancers, for use in special circumstances, as when surgery is contraindicated or refused.
   
 Shared decision making is recommended in deciding whether to go with radiation or surgery. The doctor-patient discussion would include cure rates, long-term outcomes, patients' desires, medical conditions and other benefits and risks.
   
 "It's a valid alternative," Cherpelis said. "They just have to know the pitfalls."
   
 He doesn't do radiation at his office, instead sending patients who get it to the university's radiation oncology department.
   
 "We do recommend radiation in certain cases where surgery may not be the best choice," Cherpelis said, such as when removal would be disfiguring.
   
 "It should be used in a minority of patients, not as a routine option in place of surgery," he said, adding that radiation should be kept to small cancers with well defined borders that don't have any aggressive characteristics.
   
 Pepine does standard (non-Mohs) surgical removal but not Mohs surgery. Standard surgical removal and superficial radiation have a similar success rate of 95 percent to 98 percent, she said.
   
 Cherpelis puts their success rate at 90 percent to 94 percent.
   
 Some patients have genetic conditions that predispose them to be more sensitive to radiation. It's discouraged for them.
   
 Never use it over a pacemaker or a defibrillator, Pepine said.
   
 If an area has been radiated before, it can't be radiated again. That can become a problem down the road.
   
 Radiation can cause skin cancer, usually 10 years to 15 years later, and skin cancer that recurs is harder to treat, Cherpelis said.
   
 Radiation changes the skin and affects circulation in the area treated, he said. In his practice, he said, they like to use it only in patients 75 and older when surgery isn't an alternative.
   
 Benefits of radiation for suitable patients include "no cutting, no infection risk, no pain," Pepine said.
   
 Side effects, such as redness, itching and drying of the skin, are minimal, she said, and there isn't the follow-up needed post-surgery.
   
 "It's not painful," Hornickle said. "There's a little bit of pressure because they don't want any gap between the skin and the radiation field."
   
 Hornickle is set up with a radiation apron, a thyroid shield, eye goggles and a customized lead shield around the cancer site. Treatment takes place in a lead-lined room with a lead-lined door, Pepine said.
   
 Patients come for radiation twice a week, typically seven or eight weeks. The radiation itself lasts less than a minute each time.
   
 Giving the radiation all at once would damage the skin too much, Pepine said.

In the past, journalists in the USA have been able to safely perform their work, as domestic acts of violence against them were a rare occurrence. However, during the recent protests we’ve seen journalists attacked on Main Streets across America.


  While some of these assaults can be accounted as inevitable injuries during the fog of civil unrest, many more appeared to be plainly purposeful attacks by police on reporters and photographers openly and lawfully doing their jobs.


  Vice News reporter Michael Anthony Adams told The Washington Post that he repeatedly told Minneapolis police that he was a member of the media when they ordered a crowd to disperse. “I don’t care,” one officer said as he blasted him with pepper spray.


  Los Angeles Times reporter Molly Hennessy-Fiske witnessed several journalists, all shouting they were press, who were nonetheless chased and cornered by Minneapolis police firing rubber bullets and spraying tear gas. Her colleague, photographer Carolyn Cole, was struck in the face by a rubber bullet. “I have never been fired at by police,” Hennessy-Fiske, who has reported from war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan, wrote on Saturday, May 30, “until tonight.” A rubber bullet fired by Minneapolis police left freelance photojournalist Linda Tirado permanently blinded in her left eye.


  In Michigan, Detroit Free Press reporter J.C. Reindel was sprayed with pepper gas by a police officer as he held up his news media identification. In Kentucky, a Louisville television news crew, broadcasting live, reported they were being targeted by police firing rubber bullets. In Texas, a Fort Wayne TV editor lost an eye to a tear gas canister fired into a crowd of protestors.


  These deliberate assaults on journalists going about their jobs are an assault on the rights of all Americans. The press in these situations functions as the eyes and ears of the public, providing vital information and documenting events as they unfold. When the press is — as in the most horrific incidents during these protests — literally blinded, so is the public.


  Officers are sworn to uphold the law, which includes the First Amendment right of the press to function without official impediments, let alone violence or arrest.


  During this civil unrest, journalists are doing their jobs as information first responders who keep Americans informed with truthful, objective reporting. It’s now up to the other first responders, local law enforcement, to respect the work of journalists and the right of American citizens to know what the police and government officials are doing in their names.


  Barely halfway through the year, 2020 has been a trying one for America’s free press. It has come under attack from unprecedented fiscal challenges, workforce disruptions and the reckless musings about the media from government leadership at multiple levels. What must always be protected in any year is the American people’s First Amendment right to access information unimpeded by government dictates or intimidation and by assuring the ongoing safety of journalists.


  On behalf of its approximately 1,500 newspaper and associate member companies, America's Newspapers is committed to explaining, defending and advancing the vital role of newspapers in democracy and civil life. We put an emphasis on educating the public on all the ways newspapers contribute to building a community identity and the success of local businesses. Learn more: www.newspapers.org

Excuse my language but I am SO angry. FUCK YOU @lorealparis. You dropped me from a campaign in 2017 and threw me to the wolves for speaking out about racism and white supremacy. With no duty of care, without a second thought. I had to fend for myself being torn apart by the world's press because YOU didn't want to talk about racism. You even tried to get me to incriminate myself with pairing me up with your shady lawyers, when I had done NOTHING wrong. THAT is what you get for 'speaking out' when employed by @lorealparis. Racist snakes. You do NOT get to do this. This is NOT okay, not even in the slightest. I said just yesterday that it would only be a matter of time before RACIST AF brands saw a window of PR opportunity to jump on the bandwagon. Fuck you. Fuck your 'solidarity'.

If you care about me or #blacklivesmatter, don't let @lorealparis get away with this.

Naime, skoro 90 posto svih naših turista koji idu u Grčku na letovanje putuju privatnim kolima ili autobusima preko Severne Makedonije, ali su naši južni susedi, zbog neočekivanog razbuktavanja korona virusa u njihovoj zemlji, do daljnjeg odložili otvaranje granica!     


  \- Još je rano za otvaranje granica, putovanja značajno povećavaju rizik od donošenja virusa iz neke od susednih država. Proverićemo podatke, uraditi analize i odlučiti kada je pravi trenutak za otvaranje granica. Imamo nedelju dana da razmislimo o tome - rekao je ministar zdravlja Severne Makedonije Venko Filipče.


  Šta to znači za srpske turiste? Pa, da svi koji planiraju od 15. juna da krenu put Grčke, moraju da pripreme i "Plan B". Dakle, šta će raditi ako ne bugu mogli do mora da stignu preko Severne Makedonije, u slučaju da granice ove zemlje i dalje budu zatvorene zbog širenja korona virusa.


   


  Kolima je do Grčke, naime, moguće još doći i preko Bugarske i Albanije. Ovaj prvi pravac je mnogo korišćeniji od naših turista, duži je stotinak kilometara od onog preko Severne Makedonije, ali je od Beograda do Soluna, ovim putem potrebno par sati više nego preko graničnih prelaza Tabanovci i Evzoni. I trenutno je jedini "u funkciji"!


  Naime, druga mogućnost je da iz Beograda idete do Podgorice, pa odatle preko Skadra, Drača, Valone i Đirokastre do Janine i Igumenice u Grčkoj. Problem je što Crna Gora još ne dozvoljava ulazak srpskih građana zbog korona virusa, već ih odmah šalje u 14-dnevni karantin.


   


  Dakle, svima koji planiraju kolima da krenu put Grčke već od sredine meseca, ne preostaje ništa drugo nego da prate sva dešavanja u Severnoj Makedoniji, ali i da imaju pripremljenu "rezervnu varijantu".

WESTERN TREASURE VALLEY — Now that they’ve been apart, the hard part is getting back together, as Dana Castellani, Chief Executive Director for the Boys & Girls Clubs of Western Treasure Valley, has observed. Among the novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic’s biggest effects on her members’ mental health is its playing of ’keep away’ with each other, as she described in a phone conversation on May 27. With restrictions beginning to ease on both sides of the Snake River, Castellani explained how the Clubs are reintegrating.
 According to Castellani, the clubs reopened on June 1 on both sides of the river.
 “My Payette club probably could have opened a long time ago, there were some Idaho clubs that never closed,” said Castellani. “We just erred on the safer side and and I’m headquartered in Oregon, so what I did for one I wanted to [do] on both sides. It’s going to look very different.”
 Castellani said reopening in Ontario involved becoming an emergency child care provider, how long they will need to maintain that being unknown to her as of press time.
 “Under phase one we were unable to do our traditional field trips and summer programs that we usually do,” said Castellani.
 Part of making sure the kids are okay is making sure her staff is okay, said Castellani.
 “I’m hiring more staff, so I’m going to keep those one-to-ten ratios … I’ve just gotta offer what I can. I think the other part too is just to get my staff and kids more comfortable with it, and hopefully we can add more as the weeks go.”
 With that established, Castellani said the Clubs will be maintaining social distancing by conducting classes and workshops in groups of 10, with clubs operating in morning and afternoon sessions each with their own part-time staff running it, and by limiting each session to 30 kids in Ontario during opening week, Payette just 20 kids and going from there.
 “Obviously, contact tracing is a big deal.”
 As a result, Castellani expressed understanding for those members or their families who still don’t feel quite ready to reintegrate at the club, especially those referred by the Oregon Department of Human Services.
 “Lots of foster kids, and a lot of those families, are not ready yet to send kids back to clubs. So it’s kind of opposite from what I expected.”
 On that note, Castellani cited a Department of Human Services report she got earlier in the day, saying calls for family intervention in Malheur County have been down 70 percent.
 “It doesn’t mean that the abuse has dropped by seventy percent, obviously, it just means that people who usually make the calls are not.”
 This includes reports from teachers, as students have not been in classrooms since mid-March.
 “We don’t know, I really couldn’t tell you right now what our kids are experiencing. So that’s definitely a huge motivation for reopening.”
 As such, Castellani says the clubs’ main focus will be welcoming kids back, giving them chances to talk about what it’s been like to be away, and ensuring their hand washing skills are up to par. The latter is built into the new schedules at both clubs.
 “Each group will have designated times to take their little groups and wash hands.”
 With Club programs being evidence-based, Castellani aims to reinforce focus on social-emotional needs along the way.
 “It just is geared to making them feel a lot of [positivity], like in team- building, community-building activities, and I think we’re looking at a lot more health and nutrition programs too, things that seem really basic and obvious to you and me but we really might be starting from square one with some of our kids.”
 As they reintegrate, Castellani says, kids still need to look out for their own family, especially if they live with grandparents.
 “I’m hopeful that more and more people will start to return safely, I mean not taking silly risks.”
 As a result, continuing distance services appears to be the new normal for the Clubs; Curbside meals and home activity kits are expected to continue being offered weekdays 4-6 p.m.
 Nonetheless, Castellani hopes that kids can look beyond the pandemic and see brighter days ahead.
 “I think our main message still sticks with my mission; We are there to serve the kids who need us most, and we do it by giving them a safe environment, and of course that’s a physically-safe building with staff members who really care and wanna be here.”
 She also praised parents for adapting to the ‘new normal’ of working from home and home-schooling their kids. She noted how difficult the current math standard is for parents.
 The end goal remains getting kids to academic, career and emotional successes, she said, just not without having as much fun as possible along the way.

VENICE — Going into Saturday’s Feed Venice food drive, organizer Jim Foubister was anxious because “it was so unknown.”


  Well, it’s “known” now — and Foubister is relieved.


  “Venice really came through,” he said.


  Came through to the tune of nearly 45,000 pounds of food that’s already been put on the shelves of the six pantries the event was created to help.


  “It was a great day,” he said.


  Foubister enlisted the help of 23 churches that are part of the One Christ Won City organization he co-founded to collect food for the pantries, which are dealing with high demand because of the impact of the coronavirus on the economy.


  Aggravating the need was the cancellation of the letter carriers’ annual food drive because of the pandemic.


  A call went out to the community for donations of peanut butter, mac and cheese, soup and breakfast cereal. Churches were assigned three of those items and a “wild card,” such as egg noodles, he said.


  A drive-thru drop-off was set up at Venice Christian School so that donors didn’t even have to get out of cars. Donations were sorted, packaged and taken to one of six pick-up stations for the pantries.


  Between 8 and 10 a.m., Foubister said, nearly 400 cars came through, many with food from neighbors and friends as well as the driver.


  At 10 a.m. donations from the churches, already sorted and packaged, started to roll in. One church brought it donations in a trailer that went straight to a pantry without being unpacked, he said.


  The pantries arrived at 10:30 a.m. to collect their donations, each receiving enough of the requested staples that “as far as I know, I think we’re going to be fine all the way through the summer,” Foubister said.


  By Saturday, he was already hearing from the pantries.


  “What a great food drive you put together! Best ever, smooth as silk,” emailed Doug MacFayden of South County Food Pantry. “Do we live in the most generous community or what?”


  “Thank you so much for filling our pantry with food; we are beyond blessed,” emailed Lynette McCleland of Center of Hope, which received several boxes of food from Village On The Isle.


  Foubister said the drive was so successful it won’t need to be repeated over the summer but that smaller, emergency drives could be organized if needed.


  He said he’s also going to be looking at using this model to ensure that local schools have snacks when they reopen.


  “We want to share this with everybody who’s out to help families,” he said.

The future of the Harvey County Fair, scheduled for July 30 through Aug. 3, is, at this time, undecided as officials wrestle with what precautions should be taken in the face of COVID-19.


   


  County Commissioner Chip Westfall, emergency management director Gary Denny and health department director Lynette Redington recently met with the Harvey County Fair Board to discuss the Harvey County Fair.


   


  No decisons were made at that time about the fair, but it is clear the fair will be changed from previous years.


   


  "The fair will look different," Westfall said. "It will be managed differently and handled differently. ... Be patient with (the fair board) as they deal with this and the pandemic."


   


  Westfall is a longtime volunteer judging 4-H model rocketry and measuring launch heights during annual rocket launches at an area farm. Like all 4-H programs at this time, rocketry has been delayed this year. Not a single meeting for the project group has been held, and the group launch date has not been set.


   


  No 4-H in person activities are allowed until July 4, a decision announced April 8 by the county extension office after a state-level decision stopped all in person activities for Extension offices through that date.


   


  "This is going to be a trying time for HVCO 4-H as we cannot meet to discuss things face to face or in project meetings to learn and grow our knowledge in project areas," wrote Ashley Janzen in an email to 4-H member families. "However, we are in process of figuring out supplemental programming that engages you in alternative ways."


   


  That has led to 4-H camps moving online and the delay of previously scheduled events -- and, by extension, uncertainty for the fair.


   


  "Hopefully it will be back to normal next year," Westfall said.


   


  Westfall said the fair board is expected to make a decision at its next meeting on June 15.

Susie G. Sullivan      On May 31, 2020, Susie succumbed to a fast-growing metastatic cancer that was diagnosed in mid-March.      Susie was born to Waynette and John Glenn in Richmond, Virginia, on October 20, 1952. Her family moved to Memphis when she was in the 8th grade. She graduated from St. Agnes Academy in 1970. In her senior year, she met her future husband, John. She then entered Ole Miss and graduated in 1974. While there, she was very active in the Pi Beta Phi sorority. After college, she moved to Jackson, Mississippi, where she worked as a newspaper reporter. She returned to Memphis to begin a career in nursing at the Methodist Hospital School of Nursing. After graduation she worked as a labor and delivery nurse. Her loving heart, good-natured personality, strong work ethic, and professional demeanor earned her the respect and admiration of her patients and co-workers. After leaving her clinical career, she began a new career with Humana, Inc., where she was highly respected for her exceptional skills in communications and leadership.      On October 10, 1981, she married Dr. John E. Sullivan, Jr. They are the proud parents of John E. Sullivan, III and Frank Glenn Sullivan. They are blessed with three grandchildren: Harper, Gaddon, and Weston.      Susie leaves behind her mother, Waynette; three brothers, Michael Newton, Wayne Glenn and Lawson Glenn; and many cousins, nieces and nephews.      Susie had mastered the art of hospitality. Everyone that encountered Susie was treated to her warm smile and sparkling blue eyes. She truly personified grace and dignity.      Always an adventurer, she enjoyed travel by air, land, and sea. In later years she enjoyed "Glamping" (camping in trailers) with a group of like-minded girls who call themselves the Sisters on the Fly. They traveled near and far enjoying the natural beauty of our country.      Susie was an active member of the Sacred Heart Cathedral Church, where she worked with the Haiti Committee, the Parish Council, the Flower Committee, and the St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Guild.      The family would like to extend their deepest gratitude to the staff at Park West Hospital in Knoxville and the Baptist Reynolds Hospice House in Memphis for the exceptional care given to Susie during the last months of her life. They truly represent the level of professionalism that Susie herself strived to provide to her patients.      Mass followed by interment will be at Sacred Heart Cathedral in Knoxville, Tennessee, on Saturday, June 6, 2020, at noon.      In lieu of flowers, the family suggests that donations be sent to the St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Guild.

WICHITA, Kan. (AP) — Kansas health officials want to randomly test Sedgwick County residents to determine the spread of coronavirus in the area. KSNW-TV reports the local health department will offer testing to 1,600 random residents next week. Residents who get a call from the health department will be offered testing regardless of whether they have symptoms of COVID-19. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death. Testing in Sedgwick County will be held June 18 through June 20. Health officials are planning another round of random testing in mid-July to see if the virus spreads. Kansas has continued to see coronavirus cases and COVID-19-related deaths increase. The state Department of Health and Environment reported Monday that the number of cases had reached 10,011, up 292 or 3% since Friday, and the number of deaths jumped 4.5%, up 9 to a total of 217 since the pandemic hit the state in early March.

Without any further guidance from Gov. Tom Wolf's administration or the PIAA, there was not much District 3 could say Wednesday morning during its monthly meeting.
 The district’s board last met via Zoom on May 21, a day after the PIAA’s most recent board meeting. The PIAA doesn’t meet again until June 15, and neither it nor Wolf have provided many further details as to how the state’s high schools can get sports back up and running.
 “I do not [know what guidelines everyone is looking for], and I don’t want to speak out of church,” District 3 chairman Douglas Bohannon said to reporters at the end of the meeting, which wrapped up just short of noon. “But I think there’s a task force put together that’s working with that, but I’m not 100% sure. So I don’t think it’s one person working on that, so I think there’s a group of people who will be tackling that task. But I don’t know for 100% sure.”

NBA players win not just because they get to go back to work — even if the working conditions are a bit unusual — but they got the regular season games they wanted. It was the players who arguably made the biggest push for regular-season games before the playoffs, and there were two reasons for it. First, going straight to the playoffs — even with a training camp — was asking for injuries. The only way to get in game shape is to play games, and the players wanted some meaningful games in front of the postseason.

COLUMBIA, S.C. — Hundreds of cities have imposed curfews to keep the peace during a week of violent unrest across the U.S., employing a tactic that gives law enforcement sweeping arrest powers but is frequently flouted and criticized as being unconstitutional.
 From New York City to Prtland to Fargo, North Dakota, cities large and small have put curfews in place — in some cases for the first time in decades — sending out emergency notices on phones and highway signs urging people to stay off the streets.
 But the deadlines aren’t hard and fast — many of them have exceptions for people heading to and from work, reporters, public transportation and even people buying groceries. Many protesters and citizens have routinely disregarded the restrictions, and police have allowed peaceful demonstrations to continue after curfew while focusing their attention on violent unrest.

In a move that would benefit thousands of Amrapali homebuyers, SBICAP Ventures has informed the Supreme Court that it would create a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) with the court receiver and would appoint a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) to take over the construction of seven stalled projects in Noida and Greater Noida.


  The Supreme Court on May 27 had reserved its order in the Amrapali case on issues such as financing of stalled Amrapali projects through the government’s stressed fund managed by SBI Cap.


  SBICAP has filed an affidavit on June 3 and stated that they have considered the proposal of court receiver. They proposed a scheme where the homebuyers will be asked to pay their balance amount/ some deposit. A special purpose vehicle company shall be created with SBI Caps and the receiver on board.

Then there is Rick the person. I know Rick Solie. I have known him since the mid-1990s when he was a legislative aide. We are not close friends but have crossed paths in our careers.
 About six years ago, my daughter mentioned to him and a friend that I was spending my Sunday afternoon digging fence post holes so I could fence off my property and protect it from thieves who had stolen a utility trailer one week and had come back the next week and had backed up to my fuel tank with a pickup and 300-gallon tank getting ready to siphon my tank. Rick and that friend showed up at my place that afternoon with a generator and electric post hole digger and helped me build my fence. It was unsolicited and he had nothing to gain, but he was just being a good Samaritan.
 From what I have seen about his character, I think he is a good man, with good intentions. He got my vote.

OGDEN — The Weber State University professor who recently came under fire for a series of threatening tweets related to ongoing, nationwide protests says he regrets his actions and has resigned from his teaching position.


  Over the weekend, WSU Department of Criminal Justice professor Scott Senjo made several tweets which, among other things, applauded damage done by rioters to the CNN headquarters building and mused about violently attacking journalists.


  "Nothing about this makes me happy but there’s this tiny sense of rightness in the burning of the CNN headquarters," reads one of Senjo’s tweets. The Georgia-based cable news network’s headquarters building in Atlanta was damaged Friday, May 29, during riots in the city.


  In another tweet responding to the account of a New York City journalist who said he was injured by police during a protest, Senjo wrote, "Excellent. If I was the cop, you wouldn’t be able to tweet."


  Protests in response to the death of George Floyd, who was killed May 25 in Minneapolis, have occurred all over the country. Several of the protests, including one in Salt Lake City, have turned violent, with assailants burning police cars, damaging storefronts and more.


  Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who subdued Floyd by kneeling on his neck, was fired by the department after the incident and later charged with murder and manslaughter, according to The Associated Press.


  "Those are my tweets but I don't stand by them and will have to suffer the consequences of my recklessness," Senjo said in an email to the Standard- Examiner. "I made those tweets in the sordid atmosphere of Twitter knife fights where sarcastic put downs and tasteless humor are often the norm. I failed to respect my role as a college professor in the hyper-emotional atmosphere of the recent police brutality protests. I apologize for my Twitter contributions. In the aggregate, they reflect a great deal of ugliness."


  Senjo also told the Standard-Examiner he was asked to resign by the school and agreed to do so, effective immediately. The former professor said he had been engaged in "irresponsible tweeting activity over the last several months."


  "I agree that my tweets were far beyond the realm of acceptable university policy as well as acceptable social norms," he said.


  The university released a statement Wednesday morning, saying Senjo had been placed on paid leave June 2, but was not asked to resign.


  According to the WSU statement, Senjo sent an email to his department chair and college dean on June 3, saying, “I studied the situation and the public fury is too great. I have to resign immediately. There’s no other option.”


  WSU's statement goes on to say Senjo's posts were "hurtful and inconsistent with the values of Weber State University and our work to create an inclusive and welcoming environment."


  The school says it remains "committed to creating a campus environment where all are welcome, heard, valued and supported."


  Senjo began teaching at WSU in 2000.

_“Un esempio di collaborazione multidisciplinare tra elettrofisiologi, cardiochirurghi ed esperti perfusionisti_ – commenta il dott. Saverio Iacopino, Coordinatore nazionale dell’Elettrofisiologia di GVM Care & Research (Gruppo Ospedaliero di cui fa parte Anthea Hospital) – _che ha permesso di conseguire il risultato ottimale per la salute del paziente. I_ _l valore aggiunto di poter disporre di un Heart Team è quello di mettere a disposizione del paziente una squadra di professionisti in diverse specialità, che si coordinano e confrontano continuamente in merito a trattamenti e procedure, e che lo seguono durante tutto il percorso di diagnosi e cura_ ”.
 L’Heart Team, che fa della struttura barese un modello innovativo e di eccellenza nell’ambito cuore, ha visto collaborare fianco a fianco l’équipe di Elettrofisiologia, rappresentata dal dott. Saverio Iacopino, dal dott. Francesco Solimene e dal dott. Giuseppe Stabile, e l’équipe di Cardiochirurgia, con il supporto del Prof. Giuseppe Speziale e del dott. Giuseppe Nasso.
  _“Il paziente, che versava in condizioni critiche, è stato sottoposto a un delicato intervento di ablazione transcatetere con l’ausilio della metodica di assistenza_ _per la circolazione extracorporea (ECMO). Questa si è resa necessaria perché il paziente aveva una storia di precedenti infarti miocardici, era affetto da crisi ripetute di tachicardia ventricolare non tollerate e trattate con multipli shock del defibrillatore impiantato –_ spiega il dott. Iacopino –, _un quadro clinico complesso che rendeva fortemente instabile il paziente. L’impiego di ECMO ha garantito un valido supporto durante le procedure di ablazione”._
 L’ECMO – ExtraCorporeal Membrane Oxygenation, è un ossigenatore in grado di fornire ossigeno e rimuovere anidride carbonica direttamente nel sangue del paziente. In questo modo mette a “riposo” il cuore, lasciando svolgere al macchinario esterno il compito di “pompaggio” del sangue. L’intervento sul 74enne ha visto dunque impegnati cardiochirurghi e perfusionisti per stabilizzare l’uomo grazie ad ECMO e contemporaneamente gli elettrofisiologi per rimuovere l’aritmia cardiaca tramite ablazione.
  _“L’Heart Team ha ritenuto che, per trattare l’aritmia ventricolare in questo paziente, la combinazione dell’ablazione transcatetere e l’utilizzo della metodica ECMO fosse la scelta vincente –_ specifica il dott. Iacopino –. _Per poter mappare correttamente l’area da trattare, infatti, è necessario che si manifesti l’aritmia, ma il paziente non era in condizione di poterla tollerare._ _Questa procedura con l’ausilio di ECMO ha supportato la stabilità emodinamica del paziente durante tutto l’intervento, permettendo un accurato monitoraggio e consentendo all’elettrofisiologo di identificare più facilmente l’anomalia elettrica da trattare”._
 Nel panorama sanitario nazionale sono poche le strutture di Alta Specialità in ambito cardiovascolare. Tra queste, Anthea Hospital rappresenta una eccellenza. _“La struttura di Bari è centro di riferimento per il trattamento mininvasivo delle principali problematiche legate al cuore, nello specifico per la valvulopatia mitralica e per il trattamento della fibrillazione atriale_ – commenta il Prof. Speziale, Coordinatore nazionale delle Cardiochirurgie di GVM Care & Research –. _L’esperienza, ampia per casistica e maturata da anni, ci consente di mettere a disposizione dei pazienti un Heart Team di professionisti dalle riconosciute abilità e di proporre metodiche innovative e d’avanguardia a beneficio di tutti”._
