He is now very well balanced and he is looking to score in key areas that he is not accustomed to scoring - over extra cover, over point, in front of point and his balance and his weight is staying there, he is not falling over to the off-side to create shots on the leg side. That is a vast improvement that he has made, which obviously going to help his all-round batting. I believe, this young lad has a long-long way to go,&quot; Lara said.

TUCSON, Ariz. — Three of the seven total candidates will soon serve as governing board members for the Tucson Unified School District.
 The top issue presented to them: the pandemic and ensuring the safety of students and, in-particular, educators.
 This as the district weighs options to open campuses again.
 "I worked with online teachers, special-ed teachers, principals. They were all online. There is that possibility if they don't want to be in the classroom, we've got great resources," said candidate, Cristina Mennella.
 Businessman Nick Pierson said the governing board should have a plan ready for returning to campus.
 "We've got to least in the short run, accommodate the teachers and use the virtual environment, but eventually we've got to get back to everybody being in the classroom."
 Candidate Adam Ragan, who said he was formerly an educator, says teacher safety should be priority.
 "When you ask teachers to come back to the classroom without a safe plan to ensure their safety, you're putting them at risk in a way that's unacceptable."
 That sentiment was echoed by candidates Sadie Shaw and Natalie Luna Rose.
 "I think that we need to have options and they need to based on consent and so if teachers do not feel safe going back then we should not force them," Shaw said.
 "A lot of them are parents, a lot of them have families. They take care of people in their lives that have health issues, so there should not be any penalizing of teachers who aren't comfortable going back to the classroom," Rose said.
 Cindy Winston, who said she was a science teacher, said middle and high schools have the resources for distance learning while expressing concerns about elementary schools.
 "The challenge here for me is when I'm trying to figure out how to take things off the plate is for our elementary school teachers and our elective teachers who are just being run ragged."
 Ravi Grivois-Shah, a medical doctor, said the district could do a better job inspiring the confidence of its educators.
 "Our teachers and educators and staff, they're scared. They need reassurance from our district that we're going to get this right and I don't think we've heard this yet."

Jurkovec, a western Pennsylvania native, grew up watching Pitt and Notre Dame football. He still remembers the Panthers’ heartbreaking 45-44 loss to No. 5 Cincinnati in the de facto 2009 Big East title game.
 Jurkovec was a fourth grader at the time, but the game is ingrained in his memory. In fact, he said that he was just talking to offensive coordinator Frank Cignetti Jr. about the devastating loss the other day. Interestingly enough, Cignetti was Dave Wannstedt’s offensive coordinator that season, and Jeff Hafley was coaching the Panthers’ secondary.
 A three-year starter at Pine-Richland, Jurkovec emerged as a high school star in Pittsburgh. His video game numbers reflected his 87th overall Class of 2018 recruiting ranking. As a senior in 2017, the dual-threat gunslinger posted a 39:6 touchdown-to-interception ratio while rushing for more than 1,200 yards and 24 scores. Jurkovec set the state single-season record with 5,180 total yards of offense that year.
 He got looks from several Power Five schools across the country, including Pittsburgh, which, according to Jurkovec, offered him a scholarship. Ultimately, he picked Notre Dame “off of the brand name.” It didn’t work out the way that Jurkovec envisioned, though. He sat behind Ian Book for two years, only attempting 18 total passes in cleanup duty.
 When he entered the transfer portal on Jan. 8, Panthers head coach Pat Narduzzi once again reached out to Jurkovec. It’s important to note that, about a week before Jurkovec put his name in the portal, Pittsburgh added Arizona State transfer quarterback Joey Yellen. Jurkovec mentioned that he had positive interactions with Narduzzi, but he also emphasized that, this time around, he was really focusing on fit.
 “It was pretty clear what school wanted me the most,” Jurkovec said.
 Hafley and Cignetti were on Jurkovec right when he got in the portal. He visited the campus soon after, and a few days later he officially made the move and enrolled in classes.
 “I was very honest with him,” Hafley said Wednesday. “I told him I couldn’t promise him that he’d be our starting quarterback. I told him he’d have to win the job.”
 Jurkovec bet on himself and did just that.

 As another birthday approaches like a hungry lion approaches an antelope lost in thought, I reflect that I really haven't accomplished all that much.
 But, ah, the technological advancements I've seen in my many decades-long sojourn on terra firma.
 Why, I can remember seeing color TV for the first time. It was a Mets game. I was struck by all that green grass.
 It was right about the same time the TV "network" was promoting this revolutionary new situation comedy dealing with your typical family. Many families back then featured newlywed parents, six kids, a housekeeper and two missing biological parents whose fate no one liked to dwell on.
 TV's explosion wasn't limited to color and groundbreaking drama either.
 For you young folks, I can recall when there were only three TV stations, and they didn't run around the clock.
 That's right.
 They would go off the air.
 If you were lucky, they'd leave you with a snazzy test pattern and an interminable electronic whining sound to lull you to sleep.
 Today, there are several zillion things we can view on screens at every single second of the day.
 It's been a tremendous advancement.
 There have been many such tremendous advances over time.
 They've come most noticeably in the realm of computers, of course.
 In my youth, the computer that guided the Apollo space project was streamlined from a unit seven refrigerators wide to a svelte 70 pounds. Now, a unit with commensurate memory can fit in a hot dog bun - even one loaded with chili and onions.
 Fast food has also evolved, much like a small rodent-esque creature evolved into the Blue Whale
 Now every single man, woman and child has the opportunity to eat each and every meal, from breakfast to dinner, from brunch to a midnight snack within moments of ordering.
 What can top such an advance?
 Well, many things.
 For instance, eight-track tapes were once considered capable of providing music.
 They really weren't. Today, music can be provided with studio-like quality through a variety of media, and the songs don't get cut in the middle with a loud click. It's a mind-boggling technological advance.
 GPS systems have represented a tremendous advance, as well.
 In the old days, you'd stop at a gas station and ask directions.
 And while this was a great way to meet new people it also revealed how often people working in gas stations commuted to work from other communities.
 You'd often hear the refrain, "Gee, I don't know. I'm not from around here."
 The phenomenon probably should have been subjected to sociological study.
 But the greatest technological advances (outside of medicine, communications, transportation, and agriculture to name several) undoubtedly came in the realm of frozen dinners.
 That's right, kids.
 You would truly appreciate that Trader Joe's Chicken Tikka Masala, Mushroom Ravioli, or Stouffer's Lasagna with Meat and Sauce if you had faced the ordeal of the old-time frozen dinner.
 The aluminum serving tray (nothing says fine dining like aluminum) was divided into compartments.
 Let's say you were being served the Salisbury Steak Dinner. On the package, the meat was tucked into the largest compartment in brown gravy, and the peas, mashed potatoes and peach cobbler were all neatly tucked into their smaller aluminum cubbyholes. They all fit nicely and looked like, well, peas, mashed potatoes, and peach cobbler.
 In practice, though, the foodstuffs tended to migrate. The results were peas in mashed potatoes and the more egregious gravy in your peach cobbler.
 With the immutability of gravity, these meals never cooked evenly. Your Salisbury steak was always burned yet still frozen, which in itself is something of a marvel.
 Count your blessings kids.
 We've come a long way.

Barbara (McLain) Taylor 'Rusty'      Baden      Barbara Taylor, 92, known affectionately to her friends as Rusty passed peacefully at her daughter's home in Baden, Pennsylvania on October 7, 2020.      Barbara was the only child of Elmer and Beatrice McClain of Sewickley, PA. She attended Quaker Valley High School (Sewickley High) and the Art Institute of Pittsburgh. While studying at the Art Institute she worked as the front desk clerk at the Elmhurst Inn in Sewickley where she met her husband Joseph Taylor who was delivering milk to the Inn for his family's business, The Taylor Milk Company. She was married for 52 years until Joseph passed in 2000. Together they raised four children, Becky (Mike) Gallagher, Joseph Taylor III (Lindi), Kathy Brown (Tim), and Charlotte Fleig. Throughout her adult life Barbara worked with her husband and his family to prosper the dairy into one of the premiere dairy companies in Pennsylvania. The company was also a pioneer in the Convenience Store business with nearly 50 Stop and Go Stores in the W. Pa. area.      Barbara had a great love of books, she loved to dance, tell jokes, attend Broadway Plays, play Bridge with her friends at the Edgeworth Club, have monthly luncheons with her birthday club, but most of all, she loved to shop for Christmas gifts. Her generosity had no boundaries. A lifelong Christian, Barbara attended Christ Church of Grove Farm where she had great love and affection for her Pastor Rev. Dr. John Guest and his wife, Kathy.      A gracious lady, she appreciated good manners, saying a prayer before a meal, and always ending a phone call to her four children, nine grandchildren and eleven great grandchildren, by closing with "I Love You More". She loved the family pets and especially Harper who was her companion and ball retriever. She was a 50-year member of the Eastern Star. She was a proud volunteer, serving over 33 years at the Sewickley Hospital Gift Shop.      Our Mother had many friends, especially Annie and Gloria who were very important to her. Together we will all grieve her passing and the loss of her in our daily lives. If you knew our Mother and would like to send a memorial, we would ask that contributions be made to Christ Church at Grove Farm or Good Samaritan Hospice.      There will be a service of Christian burial at Christ Church Grove Farm on Saturday the tenth of October 2020 at 11 a.m., all are welcome to attend, (face masks and social distancing protocols are in effect).      The family extends its heartfelt thanks and praise to the Good Samaritan Hospice Staff especially Silvana, Lynn, Brittany, and Jenny, you are Angels of Mercy and you have the undying love and affection of our family.

CHICAGO (AP) — A 17-year-old accused of killing two protesters days after Jacob Blake was shot by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, is due back in court Friday as his attorneys fight efforts to send him to Wisconsin to stand trial on homicide charges.No immediate decision is expected during Kyle Rittenhouse’s scheduled hearing in Lake County, Illinois. At Rittenhouse’s last court hearing in late September, Judge Paul Novak gave his attorneys two weeks to prepare filings and said he would then schedule a hearing on the issue.In court records filed late Thursday, Rittenhouse’s attorneys argued that he was acting in self-defense and extraditing him to Wisconsin authorities would violate his constitutional rights.They also argue that Wisconsin prosecutors and Illinois authorities didn’t follow legal technicalities required for extradition. A Kenosha County prosecutor didn’t immediately respond to an email after hours on Thursday about the extradition paperwork.Extradition is typically a straightforward process, and legal experts have expressed doubt that Rittenhouse’s attorneys could successfully prevent a court from sending him to Wisconsin to face charges there.His arrest has become a rallying point for some on the right, with a legal defense fund that has attracted millions in donations. But others see Rittenhouse as a domestic terrorist whose presence with a rifle incited the protesters.The document echoes attorneys' previous portrayal of Rittenhouse as a courageous patriot who was exercising his right to bear arms during unrest over the shooting of Blake, who is Black.Extraditing Rittenhouse, they claim, “would be to turn him over to the mob.”“The premature and unsupported charges are contributing to unwarranted public condemnation,” attorneys wrote. “Rittenhouse has been publicly branded a ‘mass murderer,’ a ‘terrorist,’ a ‘racist,’ and more.”Rittenhouse was arrested at his home in Antioch, Illinois, a day after prosecutors say he shot and killed two protesters and injured a third during unrest on the streets of Kenosha on Aug. 25 over Blake’s shooting.Rittenhouse, who is white, is charged with first-degree intentional homicide in the killing of two white protesters and attempted intentional homicide in the wounding of a third. He also faces a misdemeanor charge of underage firearm possession for wielding a semi-automatic rifle.Like Rittenhouse, the two men killed and the third man wounded were or are white. If convicted of first-degree homicide, Rittenhouse would be sentenced to life in prison.Legal experts had questioned what basis Rittenhouse’s attorneys could use to fight his extradition, which is usually an uncontested step. Mike Nerheim, the Lake County state’s attorney, has said that Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed a warrant to return Rittenhouse to Wisconsin after a request from Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, a fellow Democrat.The killings happened amid protests on Kenosha’s streets two days after a white police officer shot Blake seven times in the back, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down and sparking outrage after video of the shooting was posted online. A Wisconsin Department of Justice investigation into that shooting is ongoing. The three responding officers are on administrative leave.According to prosecutors and court documents, Rittenhouse shot and killed 36-year-old Joseph Rosenbaum, of Kenosha, after Rosenbaum threw a plastic bag at Rittenhouse, missing him, and tried to wrestle his rifle away.While trying to get away in the immediate aftermath, Rittenhouse was captured on cellphone video saying “I just killed somebody.” According to the complaint filed by prosecutors, someone in the crowd said, “Beat him up!” and another yelled, “Get him! Get that dude!”Video shows that Rittenhouse tripped in the street. As he was on the ground, 26-year-old Anthony Huber, of Silver Lake, hit him with a skateboard and tried to take his rifle away. Rittenhouse opened fire, killing Huber and wounding Gaige Grosskreutz, of West Allis, who was holding a handgun.Rittenhouse’s extradition would not be an issue if he had been arrested in Kenosha the night of the shootings. Cellphone video that captured some of the action shows that right after the shootings, Rittenhouse walked slowly toward a police vehicle with his hands up, only to be waved through by police.He returned to his Illinois home and turned himself in soon after. Police later blamed the chaotic conditions for why they didn’t arrest Rittenhouse at the scene.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

ELKO – For Zachary Arbillaga, cooking Basque food is second nature. His grandmother cooked at the Nevada Dinner House for 40 years, and from a young age he was right there with her.
 “My grandparents met there,” said Arbillaga. “She was a cook and he was a sheepherder living upstairs. I grew up in the restaurant. My siblings and I would go in at three in the morning with her to start the soup and we would sleep in the dining room.”
 He cooked at Toki Ona while in high school, cooks for the annual Basque Festival and Silver State Stampede, and has been working with Ramon Zugazaga, a locally well known Basque caterer, on the weekends for several years.
 “I learned a lot cooking with my grandma and Ramon,” Arbillaga said.
 Zugazaga has been in the food business for many years and wants to partially retire, so Arbillaga has stepped in to take over the main duties and received his business license in March.
 Arbillage intends to carry on cooking many of Zugazaga’s favorite dishes and may explore some other ideas, including more traditional Basque specialties of the past.
 “Right now my generation is not big into tripe and stuff like that, but I think the food world is starting to become a bigger world. We notice that when you go to buy things like heart, liver and tripe the prices have gone up a lot, so people are using these things more,” he said.
 One of the most popular items in Zugazaga’s current menu is paella and Arbillaga sees no need to alter a masterpiece.
 “About 99 percent of the people want this,” he said.
 For those who have not savored this scrumptious concoction of rice, saffron, chicken, shrimp, mussels, and chorizo, the time is now, according to Arbillaga.
 Watching him work in the kitchen at the Basque House is akin to viewing a professional dancer maneuver the stage, limbs akimbo or perpendicular to the floor, but somehow managing to place the artist and the expression in just the right place.
 “I love the fast-paced nature of cooking, kind of a controlled chaos,” he said. “The guys and I have a lot of camaraderie,” said Arbillaga. “The easiest way to display a culture is through food.”
 Arbillaga will continue his full-time job during the weekdays, but weekends leave plenty of time to pursue his passion of pleasing others.
 Continuing in the same style of service that Zugazaga has carried out over the years, Arbillaga will be cooking wholesome, crowd pleasing food for Christmas parties, weddings, funerals, birthday parties and other occasions. By request, he can include waitresses and separate courses, including soup and salad.
 He cooks everything except the bread and deserts. Arbillaga purchases freshly- made bread from the Basque owner of Ogi Delhi. Grandma is still making the flan and rice pudding.

All things considered, sales approaching 14 million vehicles is actually quite impressive.

MORENCI -- For years, the Morenci girls cross country team has been able to get a few athletes together, but struggled with putting together a team that could fully contend for Tri-County Conference championships or state postseason.
   
 Entering the 2020 season, the last time the Bulldog girls won a TCC championship was 17 years ago in 2003, a period of time which Morenci's third- year coach Zack Phillips called "before most of these girls were born."
   
 With all the tumult of this season, Morenci has had an additional challenge thrown its way this year, as junior Trinity Kaufman, arguably the top runner from the Bulldogs the past few years and one of the best in the county, has only competed in one meet this season back on Sept. 19.
   
 And yet, Morenci has been on a roll so far this year, and has emerged as one of the frontrunners in the TCC.
   
 "I couldn't be more proud of either team, but I really couldn't be more proud of the girls to step up with the adversity," Phillips said. "Not just with losing Trinity here for a bit but COVID and all the differences that we've had to go through, and they've really stepped up and impressed me."
   
 The Bulldogs under Phillips, a former Morenci runner himself who was part of the last Bulldog boys team to win the TCC in 2005, have surged.
   
 In the pair of TCC jamborees this year, Morenci has won both, including once at Madison's home course on Sept. 15, and in the six of seven meets that have had team scores according to athletic.net, the Bulldogs have only finished outside the top three in the team standings once and have won three meets including the pair of TCC jamboree victories.
   
 "It helps getting the two freshmen up there to give us a little depth," Phillips said. "Josie (Zuvers) and Clarissa (Berger) have been pushing each other to get that strong number five spot. We're hoping to get Trinity back in the next couple of weeks as well, and she'll really help put the team over the top. Everybody's goal is to qualify for states at regionals, and we're really going to push for that."
   
 The charge of the Bulldogs has been spearheaded by two runners, one upperclassman and one underclassman. Junior Libby Rorick and freshman Neili Pike, both of whom have ties via their parents to Morenci. The two have consistently been on each other's heels and pushing each other forward despite Pike making the jump from the middle school team right to high school.
   
 "I love it," Pike said. "I think it's kind of an honor just to be part of our team because I love our team so much and we've really been improving this year."
   
 Rorick, Pike and Rorick's younger sister, a fellow freshman to Pike in Leah Rorick, have helped each other and the team's challenge at the top of the TCC, with the results speaking for themselves.
   
 Both Libby Rorick and Pike have each scored three or more runner-up finishes individually, and combined, the pair have finished in the top five within a few places of each other in every meet except for one.
   
 "It's fun to encourage (Leah) and just see how much she's improving," Rorick said.
   
 Tuesday's race was no different.
   
 Libby Rorick and Pike ran in close formation for most of the race before Rorick pulled away in the final stretches to take second by over six seconds ahead of Pike, but behind Summerfield's Alexandria Ausmus in first, for her fourth runner-up finish and the fifth time that the pair of Bulldogs finished back-to-back.
   
 "It's awesome," Libby Rorick said. "We love to continuously push each other like that. It's great competition. It's great to have Neili pushing me all the time, and being right there. I know she's right there, so I've got to run my best."

Elizabeth "Mickey" Gross, 87 of Cheboygan, passed away on Saturday, September 12, 2020 at Bay Bluffs in Harbor Springs. Elizabeth was born on May 30, 1933 in Flat Rock, Michigan, the daughter of Benjamin and Pearl (Stith) Davis.Elizabeth was the youngest of 11 children, whose mother had the sole responsibility for raising the family soon after Elizabeth's birth. Her oldest sister Octa, 20 years old at the time, went to work to help support the family during the great depression. She spent most of her youth in Detroit, MI and summers as a young teenager in Missouri at her grandfather Eli Stith's farm, where she developed a fondness for farm animals, especially her pet pigs Porky and Petunia. Elizabeth attended high school in Detroit and in the mid 1950's began working in the accounting department of Uniroyal Company in Detroit, operating the state of the art "Comptometer" mechanical accounting machine. In February 1955 she married Joseph Gross, who had just returned from service in Korea and was starting his career as a Detroit Police officer. She and Joe raised four children in Detroit before Joe retired in 1987. By then, they had built a house on 80 acres near Cheboygan, MI, where they moved following Joe's retirement.Elizabeth was a wonderful wife, mother, and grandmother. She loved cooking, such that her grandchildren (and children) eagerly awaited a large box containing homemade cookies from grandma each Christmas. She loved all animals, especially basset hounds. Over the years, she took care of dogs, cats, guinea pigs, rabbits, and a talking parrot who became an expert at imitating her infectious laughter. Her hobbies included collecting cookie jars and sewing. Due to her great sense of humor and giving nature, she made friends easily throughout her life. Her friends included many of the staff and volunteers at Bay Bluffs Medical Care, who provided her fantastic care during the last seven years.Elizabeth is preceded in death by her husband, Joe and her son, Gerald. She is survived by her daughters, Lisa Gross of Denver, CO and Sandra Capron of Westminster, CO; her son, Michael Gross of Gulf Breeze, FL; her five grandchildren, Shannon Kinney, Chelsea Gross, Kyle Gross, Jessica Grossand Austin Gross; her three daughters-in-law, Michelle Gross, Carol Gross, and Margo Oliver; her son-in-law, Jim Capron, and a sister, Goldie McMahon.The family will hold a graveside memorial to Elizabeth at Carp Lake Township Cemetery in the spring.

Dorsey said the students knew how to plant vegetables, but not the way to make it work in the giving garden.
 First, she turns over the soil in the “resting beds” that have sat untouched since the spring and summer garden plants came out. Then they spread her special mixture of organic fertilizer over that, raked it smooth and then planted.
 “It’s not rocket science, but it is tedious and you have to follow the steps,’’ she said.
 She also noticed the students had different tendencies. Some wanted to just take care of business and get the plants in the ground while others wanted more precision when she instructed them to plant them 18 inches apart.
 “The math students wanted to measure,’’ but she convinced them to estimate and the job went smoothly and quickly.
 At the end of the day — which came earlier than Dorsey expected — the students were gratified by what they had done, she said.
 Harvest is still a bit down the road when the crops are mature and ready to eat. That’s when they’ll go to the normal beneficiaries such as Safe Harbor, Saint Marks Towers, Manna House and others.
 She promised to let them come back at the 30-day mark for some weeding and to let them see how things are growing and again at the end to help with deliveries “when you’re seeing the people who get to eat it.” In its short history, the garden has surpassed 1,000 pounds of donations.

Because COVID-19 cut spring ball short, Jurkovec, along with his teammates, had to learn the offense over Zoom and stitch it all together during training camp. He really hadn’t taken snaps under center and huddled up since his middle school days. Yet he worked extensively with Cignetti to understand the scheme and put himself in a position to be the team’s starter.
 “[Cignetti’s] really flipped football for me—made it fun again, made it into the way it’s supposed to be,” Jurkovec said. “I think the whole coaching staff does that. They allow us to play free.”
 Jurkovec expressed his appreciation for Hafley and Cignetti and said that he loves how they recognize that no two quarterbacks are the same.
 Hafley said that he tried not to have too many expectations for Jurkovec, purely because he hadn’t started a game since high school. In the first-year head coach’s eyes, Jurkovec is a rookie. And like any rookie, he’s had his ups and downs this fall.
 The Notre Dame transfer struggled in the first half of BC’s first two games, stepping up into pressure, holding onto the ball too long, and missing open receivers.
 Then, last Saturday, he threw an interception on the Eagles’ potential game- tying two-point conversion late in the fourth quarter. But that play was the exception to an early-season rule: Jurkovec has been elite in the second half.
 Extending plays and hitting his receivers on the money, the 6-foot-5, 226-pound gunslinger completed his final 10 passes at Duke, 12 of his last 14 throws in BC’s comeback win over Texas State, and 8-of-10 attempts on his final drive against then-No. 12 UNC.
 He’s on pace to become the first BC quarterback in seven years to finish a season with a completion percentage above 60%. Last week, he was the first BC quarterback since Matt Ryan to log at least 56 pass attempts in a single game.
 “On the field, he’s been showing really great play, and that makes his confidence keep skyrocketing,” right guard and co-captain Ben Petrula said. “Everybody around him is supporting him, so he kind of feels a little bit better each day and [can] turn into that elite quarterback that we know he’s going to be.”

The Princeton girls tennis team continued to demonstrate the development it has made throughout the season as the Tigers were able to get even with Cambridge-Isanti, defeating the Bluejackets 4-3 on Sept. 24.
 The win over Cambridge comes just two days after falling to Chisago Lakes 5-2 in a contest that was closer than the final score shows.
 In the team’s first contest of the week, Princeton was tasked with hitting the road to take on a strong Wildcats’ team. The Tigers battled hard but it proved to be not enough as Chisago would snap Princeton’s four-match winning streak.
 Head Coach Kelly Dorr was not disappointed in the matches that were played between the two teams. “It was a great high school tennis match, really good matches. It’s one where we can be closer next time and we one where if we maybe get the right line up matched up against them, we would maybe have the chance to get a 4-3 win,” Dorr said.
 The meeting against Chisago saw three different matches go into a third set with Avery Romann falling in No.2 singles while Emma Benjamin and Emily Anderson also lost in three sets. Lydia Erickson was able to win her singles match, 6-2 and 6-3 while the third match that went to three set went in Princeton’s favor as Hailey Lupkes and Jeneva Marcano won.
 Chisago Lakes took the first set 6-4 but saw Lupkes and Marcano rally for 6-4 and 6-1 sets to defeat the Wildcats.
 Losing to Chisago Lakes set up a rematch against Cambridge-Isanti. The two teams played back on Aug. 25 with the Bluejackets taking a 4-3 win.

“Our families are still feeling the impacts of the pandemic, and I think this is definitely a much needed asset to the household because we have a lot of parents that are reporting to us unemployment,” said Nina Bryant-Hunter, early childhood education division director for Community Action. “When you see high numbers of unemployment, then they’re struggling to make ends meet.”
 Paul White, CEO and president of the Communities of Coastal Georgia Foundation, reached out recently to Family Connection to ask how to help an anonymous donor provide food for children in low-income families.
 Melinda Ennis-Roughton, executive director of Family Connection, recommended Head Start and Early Head Start as the best place to reach low-income children. All students who attend the programs are from families living below the federal poverty line.
 Children are fed breakfast and lunch while attending Head Start programs. But economic hardships have only increased since the pandemic began, adding to the difficulty many families face to make sure children are fed during weekends and school holidays.
 “Head Start and Early Head Start provide outstanding early education for children six weeks to 5 years old so that they can be prepared to succeed in school and in life,” Ennis-Roughton said. “But these are children whose families are on an economic precipice and who struggle to get through each month, especially during this pandemic. This gift will help to make sure we are keeping their bodies healthy as well as their minds.”

_An unbeaten state high school championship and an NCAA Division I national championship — not many athletes can claim that blockbuster double._
  _Annie Schefter can._
  _As a senior at West Valley in the fall of 2001, Schefter rolled up 47 goals and 25 assists and led the Rams to a 24-0 season and Class 3A state title. That team remains the Valley’s only unbeaten and untied girls soccer team. Three years later, after recovering from a knee injury that erased her freshman year, Schefter nailed her penalty kick in a shootout that lifted Notre Dame over UCLA in the ‘04 national final._
  _Roger’s story here followed Schefter’s commitment to the Irish while the Rams were halfway through the stellar 2001 season._
 Women’s soccer is big news at Notre Dame, a story assuming status similar to that of the compelling national championship tale written last spring by the women’s basketball team.
 Through Thursday, Notre Dame was 4-0-0 in Big East Conference play, 8-0-1 overall and ranked third nationally.
 And you know what? No matter what the Fighting Irish do the rest of this season, they’ll probably be even better next year.
 Because they’ll have Annie Schefter.
 The West Valley senior, the Rams’ leading scorer and a player generally regarded as the best in the state, has committed to Notre Dame after also considering the University of Washington and Stanford.
 “I visited there this summer and I really liked it,” Schefter said before a recent practice at the West Valley Soccer Field. “Their program is very good. They were ranked No. 1 all last season and they won the national championship in 1995, I think.”
 Plus, there’s some family history there. Annie’s father, Dr. Rob Schefter, a Yakima native, played tennis at Notre Dame before graduating in 1972, and her mother, Gracie, attended Saint Mary’s College only a few miles away.
 So the youngest of the five Schefter children will leave the nest, kicking but not screaming.
 Sister Katie, who played soccer at Eisenhower, recently completed study at the University of Washington; brother Johnny is a UW freshman; and Bobby and Mike are seniors and sophomores, respectively, at Seattle Pacific.
 And the latter three are leaving their own soccer footprints at their respective schools, having starred for coach John Schubert at West Valley.
 But any player, of any gender at any school of any size, would be hard pressed to fill Annie Schefter’s shoes.
 Last year she scored 23 goals. This year she has 26 — so far — including 20 in her last nine matches. Numbers befitting the state’s best player, to be sure.
 What makes her so good?
 “She excels,” Schubert said, “at everything. She’s a 4.0 student. She’s an athlete in every sense of the word. And she’s more competitive than almost any of the girls I’ve ever seen.”

A criminal wanted in eight cases of robbery, kidnapping and cheating has been arrested by the Crime Branch of Delhi Police. The accused and his gang members used to pose as CBI and Crime Branch officers to dupe their targets on Delhi roads. The accused Mukesh and his accomplices used to pick up target passengers at bus stands and ask them about their destination and pretend as if they were also going to the same place.      In the meantime, some other gang member would come in a car and offer lift to the target passenger. "After covering some distance, the accused used to claim that they were CBI or police officers and flash messages on wireless sets to gain confidence of the target. They would then rob the target of all his belongings," said Bhisham Singh, DCP, Crime Branch.      The gang also took ATM cards and pin numbers from the victims. In case the victim refused, they would hold him on gun point. After that they would dump the victim in an isolated place and flee.      "The gang members would withdraw money using the ATM cards and also purchase goods by swiping the cards in order to spend more than the existing withdrawal limit," the officer added.      The accused Mukesh and his associate Tinkle and Girender, both residents of Trilokpuri, have been committing the crime using the same modus operandi. The other gang members are on the run and teams have been formed to arrest them.

For Zoe Gillett, Telluride checked all the boxes whenever she was looking to move from Cusco, Peru, where she lived and taught for over 10 years, in order to teach fifth-grade dual immersion Spanish. Her brother, Tuck, lives here. The school district offers Spanish-speaking classes and opportunities. Plus, the local Spanish-speaking community is strong. Telluride just “fit the bill.”
 “(Tuck) has been singing Telluride’s praises for many years. I actually met with the Telluride Elementary School principal when dual immersion was just about to start, so I have been following the program’s progress closely,” she explained. “One of the things I love about Telluride is the connection between the school and the community. … In addition, when deciding to move to back to the U.S. with my children, I was very focused on finding a community that cared deeply for its Spanish-speaking families and where my children would feel a connection to their culture, music and traditions.”
 Gillett, who has been serving as the Telluride Intermediate School principal since former principal Sheree Lynn resigned earlier this school year, will transition into the position as the TIS Interim Principal Interview Committee named her the finalist this month.

KINGSTON - With six starters returning, including two Patriot League All- Stars, the Silver Lake field hockey team is hopeful it can post a winning record in the pandemic-shortened 11-game regular season and then make some noise in the double-elimination league tournament that will replace the state tournament this fall.
 Senior Caity Hazley and junior Toni Irerdi will lead the Lakers. Both were named league all-stars last season and figure to spearhead the attack in the new 7-on-7 format. Irerdi is coming off a season when she led the team in scoring with seven goals and five assists, while Hazley directed the offense from midfield.
 "[The 7-on-7 format] definitely suits Toni," Head Coach Erica McGhee said. "We leave her up front, above the 50. She and Caity work great as a team. They kind of feed off each other."
 Irerdi got off to a great start in the team's opener on Oct. 1, scoring both goals in the Lakers' 2-1 win over Whitman-Hanson.
 Still, McGhee said there are adjustments to playing 7-on-7. "It's going to be a very different game," she said. "It's much faster. You don't have people who they normally would be to pass to, and we will be putting a lot on our defense. In 11-on-11, it's natural for them. In 7-on-7, they don't know where to go or where their teammates will be.
 "But we're fast and we have good stickwork. I think we'll score a lot this year."
 With so much open field, fatigue will also be a factor. "I will have to sub frequently, probably every five minutes," she said.
 The Lakers also welcome back starters Calleigh Nolan, Paige Nally, Natalie Bohmbach and Allison Dahlen. Nolan, a senior midfielder and defender, scored three goals last season. Nally and Bohmbach, also seniors, will be on the backline, and Dahlen, a senior, returns in goal.
 "Allison has worked really hard in the offseason," McGhee said. "She played club and worked on her conditioning. She is doing really well and being very aggressive in net."
 First off the bench will be senior forward Ava Mirisola, junior forward/midfielder Hailey Beatrice, junior forward Abby Powers and senior forward Jordan Bucherri.
 "Beatrice and Powers will be interchangeable. I can put them at any position on the field," McGhee said. "They will be an integral part of the team."
 Although the season will be over quickly, McGhee said none of her players are complaining. "They are just pumped to be playing," she said. "None of them have complained about wearing a mask. They are just happy to be on the field."

Barbara (McLain) Taylor 'Rusty'BadenBarbara Taylor, 92, known affectionately to her friends as Rusty passed peacefully at her daughter's home in Baden, Pennsylvania on October 7, 2020. Barbara was the only child of Elmer and Beatrice McClain of Sewickley, PA. She attended Quaker Valley High School (Sewickley High) and the Art Institute of Pittsburgh. While studying at the Art Institute she worked as the front desk clerk at the Elmhurst Inn in Sewickley where she met her husband Joseph Taylor who was delivering milk to the Inn for his family's business, The Taylor Milk Company. She was married for 52 years until Joseph passed in 2000. Together they raised four children, Becky (Mike) Gallagher, Joseph Taylor III (Lindi), Kathy Brown (Tim), and Charlotte Fleig. Throughout her adult life Barbara worked with her husband and his family to prosper the dairy into one of the premiere dairy companies in Pennsylvania. The company was also a pioneer in the Convenience Store business with nearly 50 Stop and Go Stores in the W. Pa. area. Barbara had a great love of books, she loved to dance, tell jokes, attend Broadway Plays, play Bridge with her friends at the Edgeworth Club, have monthly luncheons with her birthday club, but most of all, she loved to shop for Christmas gifts. Her generosity had no boundaries. A lifelong Christian, Barbara attended Christ Church of Grove Farm where she had great love and affection for her Pastor Rev. Dr. John Guest and his wife, Kathy. A gracious lady, she appreciated good manners, saying a prayer before a meal, and always ending a phone call to her four children, nine grandchildren and eleven great grandchildren, by closing with "I Love You More". She loved the family pets and especially Harper who was her companion and ball retriever. She was a 50-year member of the Eastern Star. She was a proud volunteer, serving over 33 years at the Sewickley Hospital Gift Shop. Our Mother had many friends, especially Annie and Gloria who were very important to her. Together we will all grieve her passing and the loss of her in our daily lives. If you knew our Mother and would like to send a memorial, we would ask that contributions be made to Christ Church at Grove Farm or Good Samaritan Hospice. There will be a service of Christian burial at Christ Church Grove Farm on Saturday the tenth of October 2020 at 11 a.m., all are welcome to attend, (face masks and social distancing protocols are in effect).

Another short Skyridge scoring pass — this one from Hillstead to senior wide receiver Mitch Adamson from three yards out — gave the Falcons a two-score lead. A pair of blocked extra points, however, would prove costly.
 After the Skyridge defense stopped Corner Canyon, the Falcon offense had one more chance to put points on the board before halftime as two big passes got the ball to the Charger 1-yard line.
 Skyridge tried to power the ball into the end zone and through the mass of bodies it was impossible to tell if the ball crossed the goal line or if the runner was down first, but the ball popped free and Corner Canyon recovered it for a crushing fumble.
 The home team later would have two more potential touchdowns taken off the board.
 The first was when a fourth-down pass to Adamson in the end zone was ruled that it wasn't controlled before he went out of bounds.
 The second was even costlier because it came on the final drive after the Chargers had put together their big fourth-quarter rally to go in front.
 Hillstead connected with junior wide receiver Connor McAllister, who weaved through the Corner Canyon defense for a 41-yard score — only to have it called back because of an illegal-shift penalty that had nothing to do with the play.
 "We know we had our chances," Lehman said. "We can't have a turnover in the red zone or have flags when we are driving in the two-minute drill. But these are guys who fought and competed, and sometimes you make those mistakes."
 Skyridge proved once again that it belongs in the upper echelon of 6A football and that's where the Falcons want to be.
 "This game and the Lone Peak game were 50-50 games," Lehman said. "We've got to stick with it and continue to put ourselves in position to win. Sometimes things just don't go your way but we will fight to the end. We know we can play with anyone."
 Skyridge (7-2, 2-2) will finish the regular season when it hosts Westlake on Oct. 14, while Corner Canyon (9-0, 4-0) will host American Fork the same evening.
 Both games are scheduled to begin at 7 p.m.

To the Editor:
 It’s that time of the year again. With campaign season in full swing, political rhetoric is at its peak and people are tired. I recently received a campaign brochure attacking our state representative on public safety, littered with lies about her supposed support of violent protesters and efforts to defund the police. I was very disappointed to learn the sender of the postcard was the Minnesota Republican Party.
 This is a gross misrepresentation of who Kristin Bahner is and what she stands for. The truth is, since 2019, Bahner has fiercely advocated for increased funding to upgrade the Maple Grove Public Safety training facility that serves law enforcement at all levels- Maple Grove Police Officers, all the way up to the F.B.I. She worked with Republican Senate Majority Leader Gazelka and our own Senator Limmer on a public safety compromise package of legislation this summer amid the civil unrest in St. Paul and Minneapolis. And she worked hard to ensure first responders- including police- are guaranteed workers compensation benefits if they contract COVID-19 on the job.
 While it may seem like we live in a world where facts don't matter, 2020 has taught us it's mo important now than ever to trust facts, do the research, and verify your sources. I encourage you to go to Kristin's website, bahnerforhouse.com to learn about the work she's doing to ensure that Maple Grove and Osseo remain healthy, safe communities, where everyone can thrive.

Criticising the Assam government for flouting Supreme Court directives regarding detention centres for illegal immigrants, the Gauhati high court has held that those should be outside jails.
 In an order issued on Wednesday, Justice Achintya Malla Bujor Barua stated that pending repatriation, illegal immigrants can't be confined in prisons and deprived of basic human rights and dignity.
 The court was acting on several petitions on the manner in which detention centres are to be operated in Assam to house illegal immigrants awaiting deportation or adjudication of their claims as Indian citizens.
 Also read: Gauhati HC notice for Centre, Assam over nod to OIL to drill for oil, gas in national park
   
   
 At present, there are six detention centres inside jails in Goalpara, Kokrajhar, Tezpur, Silchar, Jorhat and Dibrugarh in Assam. The state government had informed the assembly in August this year that there are 425 detainees in these centres.
   
   
 A separate detention centre with a capacity to house over 3,000 is being built in Goalpara district.
 Citing an earlier Supreme Court order, the court held that state governments should set up sufficient number of detention centres outside jail premises and ensure that these places have adequate electricity, water, hygiene and security.
 "It is noted that even the model manual for detention centres provides that the detention centres be set up outside jail premises. If suitable accommodations are not available, the state government may look for hiring of private buildings for the purpose," the order read.
 The court held that a communication by Centre to Assam government in 2018 allowing earmarking of a specific area inside jail premises to house illegal immigrants does not hold water as the move was allowed only as a temporary measure and not for long duration.
 "It is discernible that more than 10 years have gone by, since a part of the jail premises in Goalpara, Kokrajhar and Silchar had been declared to be detention centres. Certainly a period of over 10 years cannot be understood to be a temporary arrangement. Even in the respect of Jorhat, Dibrugarh and Tezpur, a period of 5 years is almost over which also cannot be strictly said to be a temporary arrangement," the court held.
 "Considering the said aspect, it cannot be accepted that the respondents can still rely upon the communication dated 7/9/2018 to project the case that it would be permissible to declare a part of the jail premises to be detention centres," it added.
 The court directed the state government to submit an action taken report within October 16, the next date of hearing, on the steps that have been taken to set up detention centres outside jail premises.

LONDON, Oct 8: Sterling inched up towards $1.30 on Thursday as prospects for a Brexit deal appeared to improve, with Britain giving it a 66per cent chance of success and a media report suggesting officials might be more optimistic than they were letting on in public.   British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Council President Charles Michel agreed on Wednesday that some progress had been made in talks on a trade deal, though significant differences remained.   Analysts said a Bloomberg News report that in private officials were more optimistic about the likelihood of clinching a deal that official statements would suggest, helped sentiment.

“They’re going to try to do the same thing. I think it’s going to come down to explosive plays and turnovers — that’s what’s going to decide the game.”
 With so many people switching positions, Hidalgo said getting that execution to come across is by making his guys do it until they get it right. However, when there are so many new and young faces out there, it takes time.
 “It’s hard when you have new guys, and you’re changing lineups — it’s hard to execute because guys are learning,” Hidalgo said. “It’s when guys get settled in, get your guys back, and they’re doing the same thing over and over again is when execution gets better, and it improves.”
 This week will be the first time all season that Glynn will have the same five offensive linemen starting consecutive weeks. Hidalgo said they could not afford any more injuries.
 Starting quarterback T.J. Lewis along with Jayden Drayton and Caden Hutchinson and the other Terror playmakers, will have to trust their teammates to set good blocks up for them and do what Glynn Academy does best — tote the rock.
 The Terrors are averaging about 139.5 yards a game on the ground through four games. Last week, Lewis had 19 carries for 98 yards and Glynn’s only touchdown. Drayton also had five carries for 21 yards.
 While Glynn may be struggling with their execution so far this season, tonight will have a different feel to it. It’s Hidalgo’s seventh City Championship, and he said he’s looking forward to getting another win.
 “I’m looking forward to a win — that’s what I’m looking forward to. I want our kids to go out and play hard and win the game,” Hidalgo said. “That’s what I want them to do. I want to see us compete. You look forward to wins — you don’t look forward to anything else. I focus on winning. I’m trying to drive our kids with a stick to win.”
 With it being the City Championship, both teams always seem to come ready for each other. It’s the night where either the Red Terrors or Pirates will earn bragging rights for the next 12 months.
 “It’s always a great environment. There’s a lot of people there,” Hidalgo said. “It’s probably the biggest event that we host in our community — it really is. It’s a hugely popular event, and there’s going to be a lot of folks there — just bragging rights for 12 straight months.”

The World Trade Organization announced Thursday that South Koreas trade minister and a Harvard-trained former Nigerian finance minister have qualified as the two finalists to become the next director-general, ensuring a woman in the top job for the first time. A selection committee said that Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala of Nigeria and Yoo Myung-hee of South Korea qualified for the final round in a race expected to end in the coming weeks. They were picked out of a pool of five candidates. Both of the women that are in the final round are remarkably well qualified. This is something on which everyone has agreed, WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell told reporters. Weve been impressed with them from the very beginning. The Geneva-based WTOs General Council, made up of envoys from the 164-member body, eliminated Amina Mohamed, a former trade minister from Kenya; Mohammad Maziad Al-Tuwaijri, a Saudi former economy minister, and British former International Trade Secretary and Brexit proponent Liam Fox. Deeply grateful and honored to be selected for the final round in the selection process of the next @WTO Director General tweeted Yoo, who has a law degree from Vanderbilt University. We need a capable & experienced new leader who can rebuild trust and restore relevance of the @WTO. I look forward to your continued support Thank you Okonjo-Iweala on Twitter thanked WTO members for their support and wrote that she was happy to be in the final round. A previous round had cut the list of candidates from eight to five. The winner is expected to be announced no later than early November. The previous WTO director-general, Roberto Azevedo of Brazil, made a surprise announcement in May that he would leave the job a year early, citing a personal decision. He left without a successor on August 31. Azevedos seven- year tenure was marked by intense pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who repeatedly accused the WTO of unfair treatment of the U.S. and started a trade war with China in defiance of the WTO system. In the past, Trump has threatened to pull the United States out of the trade body altogether. The WTOs dispute settlement system is perhaps the worlds best-known venue for resolving international trade disputes - such as those pitting plane-makers Boeing and Airbus in recent decades. But the United States has clogged up the dispute settlement machinery by blocking any new members for its highest court, the Appellate Body, which has unable to address new disputes since last year. The next director-general will face the daunting task of keeping the United States on board if Trump wins a second term, amid Washingtons allegations that China is engaged in unfair practices such as excessively subsidizing industries and stealing intellectual property notably at the expense of Western businesses hoping to tap the expanding Chinese market. China rejects the allegations. The WTO, which was created in 1995 out of the former General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, has never had a woman director- general or national from Africa as its leader. It operates by consensus, meaning that any single member country can block decisions

NEW YORK, Oct 8: The coronavirus pandemic has stalled a once-furious race among energy companies to build deepwater oil export terminals off the Texas coast, amid permitting delays and rising environmental opposition.   Only three out of an initial dozen offshore US Gulf Coast oil export proposals remain before federal maritime regulators. They are being slow-walked as the coronavirus slashed global fuel demand and the gusher from US shale fields ebbed, said analysts.   "While these projects may be on the drawing board, they are more or less in a state of limbo given that in the current crude oil price environment, there's more than ample export capacity already available," said Andrew Lipow, president of consultancy Lipow Oil Associates.   US oil production has declined 18per cent and crude prices CLC1 have tumbled 35per cent this year, lessening demand for new export ports. Daily US crude exports slowed to 8per cent gain through July, down from 46per cent last year, according to US data.   Bluewater Texas Terminal, a joint venture of oil refiner Phillips 66 PSX.N and trader Trafigura TRAFGF.UL, remains far from a final go-ahead by the partners. The companies are continuing to supply information for needed approvals, Phillips 66 spokesman Rich Johnson said.   Sea Port Oil Terminal, backed by Enterprise Product Partners LP EPD.N and Enbridge Inc ENB.TO, also no longer expects to secure federal permits this year, said Enterprise spokesman Rick Rainey.   Permit reviews for Texas GulfLink deepwater port, proposed by Sentinel Midstream LLC and Freepoint Commodities LLC, also was suspended. Sentinel was not immediately available to comment.   While crude export increases have slowed, environmental opposition to the major proposals has soared. Environmentalists have petitioned federal regulators to halt reviews until the pandemic fades and public hearings can be held.   Sierra Club recently submitted a letter signed by 22,400 people to regulator Maritime Administration opposing the Bluewater terminal. It and other groups also have rallied opponents to Enterprise's SPOT terminal.   "There is huge community opposition around these projects," said Sierra Club attorney Devorah Ancel, who said many of those opposed to the projects are Texas residents. The groups oppose the projects saying they could lead to ocean oil spills and are unneeded.   There is no Texas export terminal capable of directly loading supertankers, vessels able to carry 2 million barrels of oil. Smaller ships are loaded with oil that is transferred to larger vessels farther out at sea, a method that proponents of the deepwater ports argue is costly and increases ship traffic.   As the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico led US crude production to as much as 13 million barrels per day, pipeline companies with shale oil supplies jumped into the deepwater terminal race.   -Reuters

Criticising the Assam government for flouting Supreme Court directives regarding detention centres for illegal immigrants, the Gauhati high court has held that those should be outside jails.
 In an order issued on Wednesday, Justice Achintya Malla Bujor Barua stated that pending repatriation, illegal immigrants can't be confined in prisons and deprived of basic human rights and dignity.
 The court was acting on several petitions on the manner in which detention centres are to be operated in Assam to house illegal immigrants awaiting deportation or adjudication of their claims as Indian citizens.
 Also read: Gauhati HC notice for Centre, Assam over nod to OIL to drill for oil, gas in national park
 At present, there are six detention centres inside jails in Goalpara, Kokrajhar, Tezpur, Silchar, Jorhat and Dibrugarh in Assam. The state government had informed the assembly in August this year that there are 425 detainees in these centres.
 A separate detention centre with a capacity to house over 3,000 is being built in Goalpara district.
 Citing an earlier Supreme Court order, the court held that state governments should set up sufficient number of detention centres outside jail premises and ensure that these places have adequate electricity, water, hygiene and security.
 "It is noted that even the model manual for detention centres provides that the detention centres be set up outside jail premises. If suitable accommodations are not available, the state government may look for hiring of private buildings for the purpose," the order read.
 The court held that a communication by Centre to Assam government in 2018 allowing earmarking of a specific area inside jail premises to house illegal immigrants does not hold water as the move was allowed only as a temporary measure and not for long duration.
 "It is discernible that more than 10 years have gone by, since a part of the jail premises in Goalpara, Kokrajhar and Silchar had been declared to be detention centres. Certainly a period of over 10 years cannot be understood to be a temporary arrangement. Even in the respect of Jorhat, Dibrugarh and Tezpur, a period of 5 years is almost over which also cannot be strictly said to be a temporary arrangement," the court held.
 "Considering the said aspect, it cannot be accepted that the respondents can still rely upon the communication dated 7/9/2018 to project the case that it would be permissible to declare a part of the jail premises to be detention centres," it added.
 The court directed the state government to submit an action taken report within October 16, the next date of hearing, on the steps that have been taken to set up detention centres outside jail premises.

FRANKFURT, Oct 8: German exports grew for the fourth straight month in August, official data showed Thursday, but the pace is slowing as Europe's largest economy settles into a new economic normality after the coronavirus lockdowns of the spring.   Exports grew 2.4 per cent month-on-month in August, after a 4.7 per cent jump in July, federal statistics agency Destatis said in seasonally adjusted figures.   Imports grew 5.8 per cent in August.   Germany shipped goods abroad worth 91.2 billion euros ($107.3 billion) and imported goods worth 78.5 billion euros.   The fourth consecutive monthly rise follows a steep plunge in activity in March and April when coronavirus lockdowns brought factories and businesses to a standstill.   Exports remain 10.2 per cent below the same month a year earlier -- and 9.9 per cent below pre-crisis levels in February -- while imports were down 7.9 per cent on August 2019.   The German economy has shown signs of a strong rebound in the third quarter, mainly led by domestic demand as the country began easing virus restrictions in May.   Exports, a key driver of German growth, have played catch-up since then but remain highly dependent on how other countries are coping with the pandemic.   Experts say the momentum of Germany's recovery appears to be slowing as countries around the world grapple with a resurgence in Covid-19 cases.   While German exports to China fell by only 1.1 per cent compared with August 2019, exports to the United States, which continues to be more affected by the pandemic, fell 21.1 per cent.   "New restrictions on the back of increasing infections in many countries will also leave their marks on German exports... Clearly there are more headwinds than tailwinds for the export sector," ING economist Carsten Brzeski said.   Concerns are also mounting about Germany's own spike in cases.   -AFP

Olivia Tyson earned the win for the Raiders, scattering two hits across six innings, striking out six batters and walking five, and giving up one unearned run.
 Tyson walked the bases loaded in the first inning, then allowed the bases to fill up again in the second inning, but each time she buckled down and made the pitch she needed to end the threat.
 "She settled in pretty well and threw a lot of strikes, and we made some plays behind her," Cahill said. "Lambert put together some good at-bats so they challenged her, but she stepped up."
 Tyson allowed just one runner past second base the rest of the game, which was opposing pitcher Hannah Cole, who had a leadoff walk in the sixth inning, then scored on an error.
 "They obviously have a potent lineup, and when they had opportunities they cashed in on them, and we didn't," Youngblood said. "We had their girl on the ropes a couple times, too. We could have knocked her out of the game with a big hit here and a big hit there. It would have been a different ballgame."  
 Cole pitched well through the first three frames, surrendering only one hit — Castleberry's home run. Cole made an impressive play in the fourth inning, when a comebacker knocked off her glove, and the freshman kept her composure, tracked down the ball and threw it to second base to end the inning.
 "She's been getting better every game," Youngblood said. "She's got a lot of talent and I thought she pitched well."

When the reality of COVID-19 began to set in for Kansas, Sedgwick County District Attorney Marc Bennett expected the pandemic would be more of a glancing blow than a knockout punch to the state's court system.
   
 Even as jury trials were suspended in the state, Bennett said, he figured getting things back up and running by Memorial Day wouldn't be a problem.
   
 The reality was far different, he told the Special Committee on the Kansas Emergency Management Act last month.
   
 "I figured, in the moment, we figured it would be resolved and, at the latest, we'll be doing jury trials by July 4," Bennett said. "We've had one jury trial in Wichita."
   
 With Gov. Laura Kelly set to again petition the State Finance Council on Wednesday for an extension of her COVID-19 emergency declaration, the courts will again be a major factor in the decision-making process for lawmakers.
   
 The emergency order is used to ensure the state's COVID-19 response continues uninterrupted, allowing emergency operations to be maintained and ensuring the state can access federal relief funds.
   
 It was renewed last month after Kelly and Republican legislators clashed for several hours over whether language should be added to assure residents that businesses won't be closed as they were in the pandemic's early days.
   
 But part of what pushed members into voting for the extension was lobbying by the Kansas County and District Attorneys Association, as well as Bennett.
   
 Not renewing the order would potentially free those who are awaiting trial as the state's court system slowly recovers from the pandemic, they argued.
   
 That is because of a law passed earlier in the pandemic giving Marla Luckert, chief justice of the Kansas Supreme Court, the ability to suspend certain deadlines, including state statute outlining how quickly individuals must be brought to trial.
   
 In order for the chief justice to issue the order in the first place, however, an emergency declaration must be in place.
   
 Leavenworth County District Attorney Todd Thompson, president of the KCDAA, said they would push lawmakers to extend the declaration on those grounds.
   
 "Without the extension, and until we have approval and a procedure to safely have juries into the courtrooms, we continue to run the risk of having trials dismissed," Thompson said in an email. "This is not something we feel is fair to the justice system or safe for our communities."
   
 Defendants have "speedy trial" rights outlined under the U.S. Constitution, but Kansas is a state that fleshes out those rights in statute. The problem, many in the state's legal system realized, is that those deadlines are impossible to apply during a pandemic or other emergency.
   
 Under the new law, there would be a potential buffer of several months to allow courts to have time to resume normal operations, but district attorneys have argued it isn't long enough for them to get back up to speed.
   
 Lawmakers have considered changing this, but Rep. Fred Patton, R-Topeka, said any changes will have to wait until the legislative session begins in January.
   
 "I think that's the short-term fix, that the chief justice continues to have the ability to suspend some of those statutory deadlines," Patton, chair of the House Judiciary Committee, said in an interview.
   
 In the meantime, the ability for courts to resume operations depends on where you are in the state, Shawn Jurgensen, Luckert's special counsel, told lawmakers Tuesday.
   
 Smaller judicial districts have said they could begin eating away at the case backlog quickly.
   
 And in Wichita, where jury trials have resumed, precautions have been implemented, including plexiglass in courtrooms and an outdoor tent processing those arriving for jury duty.
   
 "Jury trials are not going to look like they did before the pandemic because things will move noticeably slower," Jurgensen told the Joint Legislative Budget Committee.
   
 As it stands now, it is likely that "someone will make a lot of money doing appeals," as Bennett put it, challenging whether a defendant's rights have been violated during the pandemic.
   
 Attorney General Derek Schmidt agreed.
   
 "This is a global pandemic that is unprecedented in the last century that has materially disrupted the operations of the judiciary," Schmidt said in an interview. "You have to challenge the way its been managed, that's your job as defense counsel."
   
 One potential long-term option is to eliminate the statutory speedy trial provision altogether, although that is likely to cause consternation from defense attorneys and advocates concerned about the rights of the accused.
   
 Still, Bennett noted that other states did not have speedy trial provisions outlined in state law. Instead, defendants would merely petition the court if they felt their rights were being violated.
   
 "They simply let the courts handle speedy trial issues through the long established case law," he said.
   
 Other options exist as well. Lawmakers could elect to give more power to the chief justice, letting them suspend deadlines even in the absence of an emergency declaration.
   
 But other legislators who said Kelly had too much power in dictating the state's pandemic response are equally queasy about giving the judiciary unchecked abilities.
   
 "I'm having trouble writing a blank check," said Rep. John Barker, R-Abilene.
   
 In the end, Patton said, a compromise may well emerge to temporarily unchain courts from statutory speedy trial requirements while ensuring they eventually resume to protect the rights of the accused.
   
 "Will the State Finance Council extend? Will the Legislature change this or that? You don't know," he said. "If we were to put something in place that would suspend it for a period of time, with a set end date, that may make everyone more comfortable."
   
 In the meantime, however, the State Finance Council has a more pressing decision to make on extending the emergency declaration.
   
 Each extension lasts for only 30 days, meaning the order will expire on Oct. 15 unless action is taken.
   
 One member of the council, Sen. Carolyn McGinn, R-Sedgwick, said the issues facing the court system would likely still be on the minds of lawmakers as they thoroughly review the governor's order.
   
 Still, she predicted a less combustive meeting than what occurred in September.
   
 "It's not like anything has changed since the last time we made that decision," McGinn said. "Unless I find out differently from my colleagues, I'm guessing we'll probably be looking at an extension."

Wilson put its only points of the game on the board just before the break on a 13-yard touchdown pass. The Warriors conversion was stopped short of the end zone, and West would go into the locker room with a 23-6 advantage.
 Neither team could get anything going offensively in the third quarter, and West Limestone was hampered by a handful of penalties.
 “We just don't finish,” Davis said. “We have to clean stuff up. Down the stretch we're going to have to play better football.”
 Just over four minutes into the fourth quarter Patterson found tight end River Helms on a long pass that put the Wildcats near the goal line, and a few plays later the duo would connect again for an 8-yard touchdown pass to make it 30-6 after the point after.
 West's defense forced a turnover on downs late in the contest at the Wildcats' own 15-yard line. On West Limestone's next offensive play Slaton would take the ball around the left side, weave through Wilson defenders and win a foot race en route to an 85-yard rushing touchdown that would mark the final score of the contest.
 West will look to remain undefeated in region play next week when the Wildcats travel to face 2-5 Rogers. The Pirates only region win so far this season came at the hands of the same Wilson team the Wildcats just defeated by a close margin at 27-22.
 “We have to get our mistakes cleaned up and finish (games),” Davis said of getting ready for next week.

As of right now, the New England Patriots are still playing the Denver Broncos on Sunday. They're playing even though the Patriots are experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak that has already wiped out most of the team's week of practice and may still be spreading through the roster.
 Given what we've learned about the coronavirus, we may not know if the Patriots are in the clear before Sunday even if all of the players continue testing negative. Stephon Gilmore didn't test positive until Tuesday after testing negative multiple times following Cam Newton's initial result, and as a result many of his teammates were likely exposed during the trip to Kansas City.
 For that reason alone Sunday's game needs to be postponed, but even if you believe the game can be played safely, the situation has still put the Patriots in an untenable position. You won't hear Bill Belichick and his players making any excuses, and obviously New England isn't going to get any sympathy from around the league, but strictly from a competitive fairness standpoint this situation is unacceptable. If the NFL allows games like this to go forward, the league risks making a mockery of its entire season.

China said on Friday it has joined a global Covid-19 vaccine initiative co-led by the World Health Organization (WHO), becoming the biggest economy to date to pledge support to help buy and distribute the shots fairly.
 The move by China, where the new coronavirus was first reported, comes as it holds separate talks with the WHO to have its locally produced Covid-19 vaccines assessed for international use.
 It also comes amid international criticism about Beijing's handling of the pandemic that led unfavourable views toward China to soar in a recent survey of advanced countries.
 A statement from the Chinese foreign ministry on Friday did not give details on the level of support Beijing will provide to the programme, known as COVAX, though President Xi Jinping pledged in May $2 billion over the next two years to help deal with the pandemic that has claimed more than 1 million lives to date.
 “We are taking this concrete step to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines, especially to developing countries, and hope more capable countries will also join and support COVAX,” Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in the statement.
 The COVAX initiative aims to deliver at least 2 billion doses of vaccines by the end of 2021.
 China joins some 168 countries that have already announced their participation in COVAX including 76 wealthy, self-financing ones. But neither the United States nor Russia have joined the programme.
 ## China’s vaccines
 COVAX is co-led by the GAVI vaccines alliance, the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). It is designed to discourage national governments from hoarding Covid-19 vaccines and to focus on first vaccinating the most high-risk people in every country.
 Chinese foreign ministry’s Hua also said in Friday’s statement that China has ample Covid-19 vaccine manufacturing capabilities and will prioritise supplying developing countries when vaccines are ready.
 China has at least four experimental vaccines in the final stage of clinical trials — two are developed by state-backed China National Biotec Group (CNBG), and the remaining two are from Sinovac Biotech and CanSino Biologics, , respectively.
 It has also inoculated hundreds of thousands of essential workers and other groups considered as high risk, even as clinical trials had not been fully completed, raising safety concerns among experts.

After two controversial rounds of student elections, a fresh panel of Cornell community leaders unmuted their Zoom mics this afternoon to be sworn into the Student Assembly.
 As with each new batch of members, the assembly was asked to re-approve the S.A. charter — a collection of all of the amendments made in the past year. In effect, the meeting shed light on the changes undergone in S.A., but also discussed the air of change still to come.
 The meeting began with a warm welcome from the senior coordinator of the Office of the Assemblies. Newly elected president of the assembly, Cat Huang ’21, smiled wide as she was sworn by executive vice president of the assembly, Noah Watson ’22. The process of voting — now using the Zoom function yes for approval or no for dissent — was then explained to new members.
 The first resolution discussed, Resolution 3 passed 23-0-3. This resolution made representation in S,A. more inclusive, creating a Dyson representative, as well as an at-large reserve for candidates seeking to represent students with disabilities. The resolution also changed the name of LGBTQ+ liaison to LGBTQIA and altered every instance of the word “woman” to “womxn”.
 Resolution 4 also passed 26-0-1, ratifying last year’s bylaw amendments, which included adding a vice president to the committee of research and accountability. Now, community members can also vote online asynchronously for meetings. Finally, the S.A. approved a resolution that addressed its own rules..
 With all of the talk about changes in the past, however, this new group of voting members already seems to have plans for bettering itself internally, as well as externally with regards to the greater Cornell community.
 One voting member brought up a question about line 231 of the charter, which stated that voters may rank all of the candidates on the ballot — this particular rule came under scrutiny during the past election season when the elections directors found out that only ranked ballots would count. Watson said that this will be addressed sometime this semester, as the recent election was the first instance that shed light on this years-long issue.
 In an interview with The Sun, Huang said she felt honored to take the helm of the Student Assembly.
 “I wanted to be president because I felt like I could do something for the student body,” Huang said.
 Huang said she ran for president to see change, specifically regarding racial injustice on campus. This year, she said she is excited to work with student activists, ensure that there is student oversight of the Cornell University Police Department and its budget, as well as abolish the student contribution fee, which she has been working on through S.A. for the last two years.

ELKO – Miguel Zamudio has been in the commercial food business since he was 13 years old. Now, with two successful local restaurants going strong, he is ready to offer the community a new location with fantastic food — with the emphasis on local.
 “I am passionate about food,” said Zamudio. “I have learned a lot about sustainability, non-GMO choices and organic products.”
 Zamudio recognizes the trend that food has come full circle, beginning with a history thousands of years old where people ate local, to mass farming and importing and back again.
 Zamudio has contracted with local food producers to supply the restaurant with fresh meats, vegetables, eggs and other ingredients.
 Besides using food grown or raised right here, the restaurant will also be offering only beers brewed in Northern Nevada, including their own brand, Fresh Fare IPA.
 The way the beer is served differs from other area eateries in that Zamudio is selling the bubbly brew in large bottles, or growlers, made from recycled glass to either drink on site or take home. Once the beer is gone, a customer can bring the bottle back and have it refilled for the price of the beer.
 Although the restaurant is styled with an emphasis on local foods and an organic trend, meat and potato eaters will not be disappointed. Some of the specialties will include cheeseburgers, pot roast, steak and eggs, and comfort foods like macaroni and cheese.
 Along with the feel-good foods, diners will be happy to enjoy a family friendly atmosphere along with a wholesome meal.
 Don’t feel like eating in? Zamudio is in the process of setting up to-go meals that can be picked up on the fly and he hopes to begin a delivery service in the near future.
 Operational Manager Eriko Foshee pointed out that diners would enjoy homemade food whatever the entrée. She said there would be nearly 50 items for making specialty salads and sandwiches. Of course, the bread will be baked fresh daily.
 “We can make any kind of salad or sandwich you want,” said Foshee.
 The restaurant is almost ready to open and people can expect to try the custom recipes by mid or late January. Look for the big green and white sign in the shopping center next to Himiko.
 “We pledge to always provide high quality ingredients,” Zamudio said.
 The owner and manager are still looking for local food providers and interested suppliers should call for more information.
 Zamudio is also the owner of Himiko and Sweet Barrel, located on the Great Basin College campus.

The Princeton volleyball team was geared up to kick off their season starting with a home match against Cambridge-Isanti on Oct. 8. However, a positive COVID-19 test will delay the start of the season for the Tigers.
 The team will now have to quarantine for 14 days before returning to action. Oct. 21 is the date the Tigers can resume practicing and playing contests if deemed healthy and safe to resume.
 Princeton Athletic Director, Darin Laabs, hopes the Tigers who are ill can make a quick recovery and return in two weeks using the knowledge from the positive test moving forward. “It’s a learning process for us. We hope that nobody gets really sick out of the deal and in two weeks we get healthy kids back and we pick up where we left off,” explained Laabs.
 As for the preventive measures the school is taking to protect the athletes that have committed to play, Laabs says Princeton is and will continue to follow guidelines given by the Minnesota Department of Health and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. “We are following the CDC guidelines and Minnesota Department of Health Guidelines. We are following those by the letter and our district nurse is doing a good job with cases that come in and treatment of them. We are doing everything by the book,” he said.
 Missing two weeks will cause the Princeton volleyball team to miss a game against St. Francis on Oct. 20 in addition to the game against Cambridge- Isanti. The games will be difficult to fit in and make up given the tight scheduling.
 The game scheduled on Oct. 13 against Chisago Lakes has already been cancelled due to the Wildcats battling positive COVID tests of their own.
 The next game scheduled for the Tigers is Becker on Oct. 22 as the team will aim to return against the Bulldogs.

The original lockdown was justified on the basis that the country needed to buy time to protect the NHS from a surge in hospitalisations and deaths. “Stay home, protect the NHS, save lives” was arguably too successful a slogan, given how difficult it proved over the summer to encourage people to resume their normal business when the virus was in retreat. In the event, NHS capacity was not overwhelmed, although it is debatable whether lockdown measures were responsible for this.

Since these numbers are based on media reports and most survivors do not report assault, they most likely capture only a small fraction of the true number of cases of sexual violence against women and girls in Bangladesh.

As the county sends out thousands of mail-in ballots, Director of Elections Dawn Graham reminded voters to follow the directions when completing and returning the ballot.
 Graham said the election office started sending 8,022 mail-in and absentee ballots on Friday.
 With approximately 46,000 registered voters in Clearfield County, these ballots represent about 17 percent of the electorate.
 She urged those who received a mail-in ballot or absentee ballot to use the ballot to vote and not show up at the polls.
 If someone who received a mail-in or absentee ballot but shows up at the polls instead, it will slow down the process significantly and make it harder for everyone. If someone who received a mail-in or absentee ballot wants to vote at the polls, they will have to bring their ballot material to the polls, turn it into the judge of elections, fill out a form, and get back in line to vote.
 If they don’t have their ballot, they will be given a provisional ballot, which won’t be counted until all of the other ballots are counted and the rolls are then checked to make sure the person didn’t vote twice.
 Oct. 27 is the last day one can request a mail-in or absentee ballot, and the ballot must be mailed or turned in by 8 p.m. on Nov. 3, Graham said.
 All registered voters in Clearfield County can obtain a mail-in ballot if they request one by completing the application and providing all of the information requested including their name, last four digits of their Social Security Number, or driver’s license number of a state issued ID and voter’s full address.
 The application then goes to the state for approval.
 “We will not issue a ballot if it hasn’t been approved,” Graham said.
 Graham asked voters to only fill out one application because if they fill out more than one, it causes a lot of unnecessary work in the election office because voters only get one ballot, no matter how many applications they fill out.
 She said a lot of outside organizations are sending out applications to residents but voters only need to fill out one application.
 Once the application is approved by the state, the information goes into the system for mailing labels. This is why the full address is important. She said there is some confusion with residents of Treasure Lake because they have two addresses — a 911 address and a Treasure Lake address — and both must be included.
 When completing a mail-in or absentee ballot, only fill in the ovals, don’t make any extra markings on the ballot beyond that and do not write your name on the ballot, Graham said.
 Once the ballot is completed, it must be placed in the secrecy envelope and sealed. By law, the ballot will not be counted if it isn’t in the secrecy envelope, Graham said.
 The ballot and secrecy envelope then must be placed inside the provided mailing envelope and the back of the mailing envelope must be signed and dated to when it was mailed in or submitted, and one’s address must be on the mailing envelope.
