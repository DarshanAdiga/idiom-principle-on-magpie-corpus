“If this is approved, he makes a little bit of money, but we have to pay the price,” said Kathleen resident Allen Mills.
 After nearly an hour-and-a-half of discussion, the county board voted 3-2 to allow Nemec to proceed with his plans. Commissioners Rick Wilson and Martha Santiago were the dissenting votes.
 “One of the things I like about Polk County is that it offers a variety of living spaces,” Santiago said, “and we need to make sure we protect those opportunities and that diversity.”
 Commissioner George Lindsey, who has a background in development, maintained that the proposal meets the standards outlined in the county's land use ordinances as well as the county's own comprehensive plan.
 “If we're not going to uphold our own plan, who is?” he asked. “We're putting the planning commission and our own staff in an untenable position.”
 Wilson countered with the board's ability to make changes to its own rules as it saw fit.
 “At the end of the day, whether we change the rules or not, there's going to be times and places where it doesn't fit and that's why we're here,” he said.
 Nemec got his okay, and may soon be followed by other proposed developments in that section of North Polk, according to the county's planning staff. This was his third try at getting his property developed, with those earlier attempts thwarted by both the Planning Commission and the County Commission.
 “This is an older part of the greater Lakeland area with generations of families having lived there,” the staff report said. “Kathleen Road was widened in the early 2010s and that has encouraged further development at a higher density than what is presently found.”

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — South Carolina's governor promised on Thursday to do whatever the Marines need to keep open the training base at Parris Island after a top military official floated the idea of closing the base and building a new one elsewhere that would allow it to easily begin training men and women together. Marine Commandant Gen. David Berger stunned the military-boosting state last week when he mentioned the possibility during an interview published on the Military.com website. Berger also mentioned closing another base in San Diego, saying it might be easier to start from scratch than trying to make adjustments at each of the bases. The Marines face a five-year deadline for gender-integrated training at Parris Island and an eight-year deadline in San Diego. “Nothing, the way we’re organized right now, lends itself to integrated recruit training,” the website quoted Berger as saying. “If that’s our start point — and it is — we have to get to a place on both coasts, or at a third location.\" A spokesman for Berger expanded on his comments to the website, saying while nothing had been decided, the Marines had to consider what would be the best way to spend its money. “If you have to update a lot anyway, do you save manpower, resources and personnel by just combining the two into one?” Marine Maj. Eric Flanagan remarked. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster brought commanders from every military installation in the state to the capital of Columbia on Thursday — and he had a leader from Parris Island talk first. McMaster said the base “adds greatly to the character and strength, economic and otherwise, of this state.” “Anything we can do to support your mission, we’ll do it,\" the governor said. Parris Island has been training Marines...

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) — Maryland is reporting zero deaths from the coronavirus in a 24-hour period for the first time since March 28. The state said Thursday morning that there had been no deaths reported in 24 hours. That doesn’t necessarily mean that no COVID-19 deaths occurred in that timeframe, because some deaths are not immediately reported due to a time lag in the submission of a death certificate. Still, Gov. Larry Hogan says it’s an “encouraging milestone” and a tribute to the efforts of health care workers. Maryland has reported a total of 3,805 deaths from the coronavirus so far. Maryland reported that there have been 125,510 coronavirus cases confirmed in the state as of Thursday. That was an increase of 785 cases in 24 hours.

Estimates by the agency show that traffic deaths in the first half of this year fell 2% from the same period in 2019, to 16,550. But traffic volumes fell more than the number of fatal crashes, increasing the fatality rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled to 1.25. That's up from 1.06 for the first half of 2019.
 James Owens, NHTSA’s deputy administrator, said the agency is encouraged by the overall declines, but concerned because of a trend since April of increased fatality rates. “Now more than ever we should be watching ourselves for safe driving practices and encouraging others to do the same,” Owens said in a statement.
 The agency issued a report saying that during the height of the coronavirus restrictions with less traffic on the roads, drivers took more risks including speeding, failing to wear seat belts, and driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Average speeds increased, and incidents with people caught driving at extreme speeds rose, NHTSA said.
 A study of people injured or killed in crashes who were treated at five large trauma centers found that from mid-March to mid-July, almost two-thirds of drivers tested positive for at least one drug, including marijuana, alcohol or opioids. NHTSA said the number of drivers testing positive for opioids nearly doubled after mid-March, compared with the previous six months. Marijuana use was up 50%.
 The Governors Highway Safety Association, a group of state highway safety officials, said speeding is a factor in nearly one-third of traffic deaths. But association members reported that during the height of the pandemic, states and communities reduced health risks to police officers by limiting traffic stops.
 “This may have led some motorists to believe they could get away with dangerous and aggressive driving, despite the threat to themselves and everyone on the road,” the association said in a statement.
 NHTSA said it is holding workshops with state and local officials to address the safety concerns.

The new programs and their locations will be announced later.
 “Since these new programs will be developed over a five-year grant, we want to keep the names of the programs secret for now,” Inbody said.
 Inbody noted much of the credit for getting this grant goes to a team led by Dr. Sarah Robb, vice president for student learning, and Brenda Krumm, dean of outreach and workforce development.
 “It’s a highly competitive national grant with hundreds of applications from all over the country,” he said. “We have to compete with all manner of institutions, including giant four-year universities. But they wrote a grant that was funded. I’m very proud of them.”
 The grant will run from Oct 1, 2020 through Sept. 30, 2025 and includes numerous outcomes that must be met along the way, as well as built-in audits and evaluations. Ultimately, the goal is to meet local and regional workforce needs in the college’s service area and beyond, while increasing enrollment at NCCC over the long-term.
 This is not the first Title III grant NCCC has won. The last successful grant helped the college build the Ottawa campus, created the Occupational Therapy Assistant and Surgical Technology programs, as well as provided the bulk of the funds that renovated the Chanute campus science labs. It also established a foundation matching grant that continues to provide funds for college advancement, most recently used to buy instruments for the creation of a band program at NCCC.

This game is close to a toss- up, but Kliff Kingsbury's program is still a year ahead of Rhule's. This can be Kingsbury's revenge for Rhule ending his collegiate coaching tenure 22 months ago when they were at Texas Tech and Baylor.

“We’ll put out at least some sort of statement or guidelines and if anybody calls we’re directing them to call us back or check the website,’’ said Shelly Schloss, executive assistant to supervisor Gary Wall.
 Social distancing could be an issue for the ghouls and mermaids out and about that night.
 “The City of Troy does not recommend door-to-door or car-to-car trick-or- treating events due to it being very difficult to maintain proper social distancing,’’ said Cindy Stewart, Troy’s community affairs director.
 The city of Troy offers guidelines on its website similar to those issued by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control.
 The CDC has issued risk levels — low, medium and high — for Halloween traditions.
 Trick-or-treating is at high risk, along with trunk-or-treating, crowded costume parties, indoor haunted houses where people may scream and hayrides with people not in your household.
 The CDC recommends one-way trick-or-treating where individually wrapped goodie bags are lined up for families to grab and go while continuing to social distance such as at the end of a driveway or at the edge of a yard. Also suggested as a moderate-risk activity would be a small group, outdoor, open- air costume parade where people are distanced more than 6 feet apart.
 Low risk activities per the CDC include family pumpkin carving (be careful with the knife), scavenger hunt, a virtual Halloween costume contest and family Halloween movie night.
 The MDHHS’s Halloween recommendations are similar to the CDC’s. In particular, face masks are a concern. A costume mask is not a substitute for a cloth mask and costume masks should not be worn over a cloth mask which may cause difficulty in breathing. Homeowners are encouraged to set up a table between them and the trick-or-treaters or to distribute candy on a disinfected table.
 Oakland County will release Halloween guidelines in the coming weeks.

Hi! My name is Zero Suit Samus (or Samus for short), and I'm an energetic pitbull mix who needs some love. And I really mean that. I need a family who will cuddle with me because your penalty for not giving me cuddles is to hear the cry of my people. My foster dad says that based on my crying, I must have descended from pterodactyls, but that's silly because pterodactyls don't even like peanut butter. And I looove peanut butter. And treats. And strawberries. And watermelon. And anything, really. Honestly kid, if you give me your salad, I'll eat it. Don't want your broccoli? I'll take care of your problem. See that toy? It's in my stomach now. See that puke? Well, you can have your toy back.
 Like all superdogs, I have an origin story: I ran across the highway and caused a 4-car pileup that I ended up underneath. It wasn’t my best choice, but it’s still a better love story than "Twilight." I have to take daily medication now, or else I have pretty severe seizures. But I like to think of my epilepsy as my unbridled superpower that the world just isn’t ready for yet.
 I'm a Tulsa native, but I'm still not a fan of the Bermuda grass around here - I get allergies in the summer, so that's something you should know. Despite this, I still love running and rolling in the grass, and if you toss me a ball, I can jump and catch it in mid-air even when it's 6-feet high. I'm not exaggerating. (Pterodactyl dogs never exaggerate.) And would you mind spraying me with a hose once in a while? I love playing in water, especially when it's coming out of a tiny hose at jet-like speeds.
 But if you have another dog in the home, then forget about it because I'm a single-dog dog. A lone wolf. A rebel. I will not share my toys, I will not share my food, and I will not share my family. I do just fine around other dogs in general, but once you introduce toys or food, then I get very territorial. Can we agree that I'll be your only one?
 By the way, I love kids. I don't have these problems with other humans, so don't worry about bringing me home to your young ones. I am loyal to the bone. Don't believe me? Try going for a jog with me. I will keep pace with you the entire time, just running by your hip. Need me to lick the sweat off your face after an especially hot run? Baby, that's what I'm about. I'm a good dog. My foster family says so, too. I will take care of you if you let me. I'm eager to learn, I don't catch coronaviruses, and I'm housebroken. I won't poop in your Cheerios. Unless that's one of your commands, but why would it be? Don't want your Cheerios? Just let me have them instead.
 Samus is fully vaccinated, spayed, microchipped and is available for adoption through Compassionate Animal Rescue Efforts.

SILVER SPRING, Md. (AP) — U.S. average rates on long-term mortgages edged down slightly this week, remaining at historically low levels. Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac reported Thursday that the average rate on the 30-year home loan fell to 2.88% from 2.90% last week. One year ago, the rate averaged 3.65%. The average rate on the 15-year fixed-rate mortgage also fell, to 2.36% from 2.40% last week. Low interest rates have made already strong demand for housing even more robust, but a lack of available supply has flummoxed would-be buyers. Last week, the National Association of Realtors reported that the number of existing homes for sale in August was 1.49 million units, a decline of 18.6% from the same time last year. The dearth of inventory has also pushed prices higher, with the median price for both existing and new single-family homes pushing past $310,000. Economists were concerned about the lack of available homes for sale even before the coronavirus outbreak made many homeowners think twice about upgrading. To make matters worse, the number of people seeking U.S. unemployment aid rose remains historically high. The government reported Thursday that 837,000 Americans applied for jobless benefits, indicating companies are still cutting jobs despite the tentative recovery that began after states started reopening.

Cal Cheney of Bucket List Travel and Tours is of a similar mind.
 “As much as I don't want any more false starts and bad publicity from an outbreak on board a ship, I think it’s time to start allowing adults to make their own decisions,” he said. “In another month, it appears there will be enough testing available for people to safely integrate back into their lives or self-quarantine for a week or so.”
 He added that there was one caveat regarding his opinion about the Oct. 31 no sail date. “While I think another month is fine, a statement should be made now along the lines of, ‘If we have no major outbreaks, we expect to allow sailing November 1,’ as opposed to just going month to month.”
 In the view of Marcy Zyonse of Live the Dream Travel, an affiliate of Travel Experts, cruise lines are unquestionably ready to safely resume operations.
 “The cruise lines have come up with a more well thought out and extensive plan than I could have ever imagined,” she said. “We have to start somewhere in the process of resuming cruising. It may be a while before ships get back to capacity, but in the meantime, a partnership between the government and the cruise lines with low capacity, short sailings, strict guidelines and contingency plans seems like a reasonable first step.”
 Richard Turen of Churchill & Turen also believes lines are ready to resume operations.
 “It is fascinating to me that the consumer travel media has not reported that during the height of the COVID outbreaks earlier this year, the world’s top-10 rated cruise lines operated without any reported major COVID outbreaks,” he said. “If you imagine small- and intermediate-size luxury ships as top-tier boutique hotels that have the ability to float from place to place, you can envision a scenario where a ship becomes a continually cleaned model of proper protocols and concern for guests.”
 For James Ferguson of Travel Edge, there’s no time like the present to begin cruising again. “With strict health protocols now in place and indications by cruise lines to sail at less capacity, I feel the time is right to get back to cruising now,” he said. “While some may not wish to cruise until a proven vaccine is available, this remains a personal decision. The cruise industry has suffered enough.”

United Soccer League championship authorities have launched an investigation after the San Diego Loyal walked off the field in protest during a game on Wednesday alleging that a player had been subjected to homophobic abuse.
 San Diego, coached by former US international star Landon Donovan, abandoned the game against Phoenix Rising in California after claiming that openly gay midfielder Collin Martin was targeted with an anti-gay slur.
 The USL Championship, a professional league ranked below Major League Soccer, said in a statement it was investigating the incident.
 "We are aware of the alleged use of a homophobic slur in tonight's match between San Diego Loyal SC and Phoenix Rising FC," the league said.
 "Foul and abusive language of any type has absolutely no place in our society and will not be tolerated in USL matches. An investigation is currently underway to determine the facts surrounding the incident and more information will be provided as soon as it is available."
 The incident comes just a week after San Diego forfeited a game after one of their players was racially abused by a Los Angeles Galaxy II opponent.
 "Last week we made it loud and clear that we do not stand for racism or homophobia," San Diego Loyal wrote on Twitter. "Nothing has changed this week."
 Wednesday's flashpoint occurred after Martin was sent off with San Diego leading 3-1. Several players could be seen approaching the referee before walking off.
 In a video statement posted on Twitter, Donovan later stood behind his players for their decision to walk off, even though abandoning the game effectively ended the team's chances of reaching the post-season playoffs.
 "Our guys, to their immense credit, just said, 'We're not going to stand for this,'" Donovan said. "They were very clear in that moment that they were giving up all hopes of making the playoffs, even though they were beating one of the best teams in the league handily.
 "But they said that doesn't matter, there's things more important in life and we have to stick up for what we believe in. And so they made the decision to walk off."
 Phoenix, meanwhile, said they were investigating the incident but said in a statement the player accused of uttering the homophobic abuse "vehemently denies these allegations."

DETROIT (AP) — Traffic deaths in the U.S. fell for the third consecutive year in 2019, the government's road safety agency reported. The downward trend is continuing into this year with people driving fewer miles due to the pandemic, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Thursday. The agency says deaths fell 2% last year, to 36,096. That's 739 fewer than the 36,835 fatalities reported to the agency in 2019. The decrease came even though vehicle miles traveled increased by nearly 1%, reducing the fatality rate to 1.1 per 100 million miles traveled. That was the lowest since 2014. The agency says pedestrian deaths fell 2.7%, bicyclist fatalities dropped 2.9% and motorcycle deaths dropped 0.5%. Deaths in passenger vehicles fell 2.8%. But deaths in crashes involving heavy trucks fell by just one, from 5,006 in 2018 to 5,005 last year. Estimates by the agency show that traffic deaths in the first half of this year fell 2% from the same period in 2019, to 16,550. But traffic volumes fell more than the number of fatal crashes, increasing the fatality rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled to 1.25. That's up from 1.06 for the first half of 2019. James Owens, NHTSA’s deputy administrator, said the agency is encouraged by the overall declines, but concerned because of a trend since April of increased fatality rates. “Now more than ever we should be watching ourselves for safe driving practices and encouraging others to do the same,” Owens said in a statement. The agency issued a report saying that during the height of the coronavirus restrictions with less traffic on the roads, drivers took more risks including speeding, failing to wear seat belts, and driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

Williams, who joined the union as a welder in Rock Island, Illinois, in 1977, rose to become secretary-treasurer and then president from 2014 until he retired in 2018.
 Williams, 67, was accused of conspiring with others to cover up the source of cash for boozy meals, premium cigars, golf and lodging in Palm Springs, California.
 The union's Region 5 leadership, which was based in Missouri and headed by Jones, would hold weeklong retreats in Palm Springs and invite Williams along. He said he stayed beyond "what my union business required."
 Williams told a judge that he wondered if money was being misused but that he was assured by Jones that "everything was above board."
 "I made the deliberate and conscious decision not to press the matter. ... I could have investigated the source of these funds or directed my staff to do so," Williams said, appearing in court by video conference from California. "I was within my power and it was my duty as a UAW officer to do so. But I deliberately looked away."

That being said, it is important to remember that the E&P industry is not out of the woods yet. The oil prices may remain subdued in the near future, which will weigh on XOP's performance. The commodity has received some support from OPEC and its allies who recently talked about improving compliance with the planned production cuts. The supply concerns, however, have increased in the last few days. Libya is gearing up to increase crude oil exports following improvement in the country's security situation. Production is set to more than double from 100,000 bpd a couple of weeks ago to 260,000 bpd in the current week. At the same time, Iraq is reportedly planning to export up to 320,000 bpd more oil than usual, which has raised concerns about the possibility of the country breaching its OPEC quota of 3.6 million bpd. It also remains to be seen whether the UAE, which exceeded its production quota in recent months, will make deeper production cuts in the coming months to compensate for the excess production. Although Saudi Arabia, the OPEC's kingpin, has recently indicated that it can do whatever it takes to support oil prices, the possibility of a breakdown of the OPEC agreement remains one of the biggest threats to oil prices.
 The oil demand outlook isn't looking good either, with the looming threat of a second wave of coronavirus which could lead to another round of travel restrictions. Several countries around the world are struggling to contain the pandemic. India, the world's third-biggest crude oil consumer, has seen a record number of new COVID-19 cases and could become the world's worst-hit country in the coming weeks. Fears of the second wave have grown in Europe where the UK and France have reported the highest-ever number of cases. EU's health commissioner, Stella Kyriakides, has warned that the situation in some parts of Europe is worse now during the peak of the pandemic. The US is also seeing an increase in infections in several states.
 In this backdrop where oil is facing headwinds from both supply and demand sides, the commodity prices may remain subdued. As a result, shares of oil and gas producers might also remain under pressure. That's going to hurt XOP whose holdings primarily consist of independent oil producers.

Arkema’s attorneys planned to hold a news conference later Thursday.
 Prosecutors were disappointed and frustrated jurors didn't get to make a decision in the case, said Dane Schiller, a spokesman for the Harris County District Attorney’s Office.
 “Today’s ruling by a judge doesn’t change the fact that dangerous chemicals on Arkema property ignited and were belched in a cloud of toxic smoke over the surrounding communities, and a first responder there protecting people is now on a lung-transplant list," Schiller said.
 Before Hill's ruling, prosecutors argued that Arkema and Comardelle were negligent for failing prepare the plant by moving the organic peroxides ahead of predicted catastrophic flooding from Harvey.
 The storm dumped nearly 50 inches (127 centimeters) of rain in parts of the Houston area and caused 36 deaths locally. The power systems at the Arkema plant were overwhelmed by flooding, and without power to keep the organic peroxides made at the facility cold, the compounds caught fire and exploded. The fire forced the evacuation of more than 200 residents and sent 21 people, including first responders, to the hospital.
 Arkema has argued that the fire was caused by an act of God — the hurricane — and could not have been prevented.

 # NFL postpones Steelers-Titans after two more positive tests
 Teresa M. Walker
 Associated Press
 View Comments
 _Nashville, Tenn._ — The NFL postponed Sunday’s Pittsburgh Steelers game at Tennessee until later in the season after one additional Titans player and one personnel member tested positive for COVID-19.
 The announcement Thursday came one day after the league said it hoped to play the game on Monday or Tuesday. The NFL said a new game date would be announced “shortly.”
 “The decision to postpone the game was made to ensure the health and safety of players, coaches and game day personnel,” the league said. “The Titans facility will remain closed and the team will continue to have no in-person activities until further notice.”
 On Tuesday, the Titans (3-0) placed three players on the reserve/COVID-19 list, including key players defensive captain and lineman DaQuan Jones and long snapper Beau Brinkley. Outside linebacker Kamalei Correa became the fourth on that list Wednesday.
 With the two new cases, the Titans’ total is now 11: five players and six other organization members. That doesn’t include outside linebackers coach Shane Bowen whose positive result came back last Saturday, preventing him from traveling with Tennessee to Minnesota for a 31-30 win.
 Coach Mike Vrabel said Wednesday he was not among the group of five personnel, but he declined to identify any of those people who tested positive. Vrabel said some of those who tested positive were experiencing “flu-like” symptoms.
 Now the NFL has to figure out how to reschedule a game between two of its seven undefeated teams after the league’s first COVID-19 outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.
 The simplest scenario for rescheduling is Week 7 on Oct. 25. That’s the Titans’ bye. Pittsburgh is scheduled to play at Baltimore that week, but both the Steelers and Ravens have byes in Week 8 allowing the NFL to make a change affecting only one other team.
 The challenge is turning this week into a bye for both Tennessee and Pittsburgh and comes after both teams started preparing to play as early as Monday. The Titans, who played in the AFC championship game in January, and the Steelers, revived with quarterback Ben Roethlisberger back now, may be playing without a break through the rest of the regular season.
 Pittsburgh hosts Philadelphia on Oct. 11. Buffalo is scheduled to visit Tennessee that day, the next game that could be affected depending on how the Titans’ outbreak continues.

Rocco loves to play with everyone. He is a lover and a cuddler and has a great personality. He has high energy, loves to go on walks and is a great companion on walks. He is smart, loves his treats, frisbees, rope, balls and he will bring his favorite - a tug-o-war with rope. Rocco is 2 years old and is very low-maintenance, doesn't need/want constant attention but does love to sleep with you any chance he gets to sneak in bed. He LOVES the water and using his sniffer to find ANYTHING while out walking, hiking, shopping etc. Rocco actually prefers men first over women and he's not much of a "in your face" right out of the gate kind of dog. He is still very leery about kids, but you can't blame him as he was abused by one previously, but does ok if they just leave him alone. Older kids would be best, but it does take him awhile to warm up to them. NO CATS because if it moves quick he goes after it. He gets along great with other dogs and he is very audible when he plays so that can take some getting used to. Rocco comes with his fair share of emotional history (don't we all?), but he is going to be the perfect fit for that perfect someone and one of his many perks is he'll make sure you're NEVER lonely in the bathroom. Rocco is a STAR Prison Training Program graduate and is fully vaccinated, neutered, microchipped and is available for adoption through Compassionate Animal Rescue Efforts.

They finally fixed their decade-long O-line issue, and it hasn't mattered. They have suffered the most painful collapse in the history of human civilization in back-to-back weeks, a new NFL record. There is little reason to think Dan Quinn's Falcons defense, bereft of any edge rushing presence, will be able to bother Aaron Rodgers﻿. There is also little reason to believe Atlanta will stop putting up points against a mediocre Green Bay defense, especially if Julio Jones returns. The Falcons seemingly only know how to lose heartbreakers.

Potgieter said the country and the globe had been adversely impacted by the pandemic and that it would be strange if the ANC also didn't feel the pinch.
 “We haven’t retrenched like other political parties, we haven’t cut salaries. On a couple of months, we have been a bit late with payments, but we have always met our commitments to our staff. The same will happen this month, as we informed staff, it will be just late by a week."
 The ANC's struggle with salaries has been an ongoing issue since December 2019.
 The party said these were some of the challenges faced by parties dependent on donations.
