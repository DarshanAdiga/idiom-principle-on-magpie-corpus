Long time Bozeman resident, Daniel T. McGuire, passed away November 9th in Green Valley, Arizona. Dan was born February 22, 1946 in Livingston to parents Ken and Ruby McGuire. Ken ran a butcher shop in Gardner. They moved to Bozeman in 1951 and purchased a home on East Olive. Dan attended local schools. In high school, he was active in dramatics and speech, graduating in 1964. He attended Montana State before joining the Army in 1967, completing his service in Germany. Upon his return to Bozeman, he found work as a bartender. In 1972, while breaking up a bar fight at The Bozeman Hotel, he was hit from behind with a board and suffered a serious brain injury that affected him for the rest of his life. He had to take strong medications to prevent seizures. He went to work for the University in the Physical Plant, where he retired after thirty years. Dan was an expert in local history and geography. He loved spending time outdoors. He enjoyed nature photography, and he joined a hiking group, spending countless hours exploring local trails. He also was an avid car guy and joined a local car club. He loved to gamble and was often seen at a local casino or poker room. He also had a passion for garage sales. With his outgoing personality, Dan made friends easily. He had countless friends, and he maintained contact with long-time friends over the years. He was instrumental in coordinating high school reunions. He was the hub contact in Bozeman, and when former classmates and friends returned to Bozeman for visits, he was the first one everyone contacted. He was a giving person and helped out numerous people. You could count on him for anything. He was also a charmer, and a favorite of the ladies! Dan moved to Green Valley, Arizona in 2016 where his sister, Karen (McGuire) Stroh lives. In his words, he was tired of shoveling snow, and he said Bozeman was no longer the same town. He is survived by his sister, Karen, and too many friends to count. Some of his friends are hoping to have a gathering in Bozeman next summer to share memories. An Irish Funeral Prayer: Death is nothing at all. It does not count. I have only slipped away into the next room. Everything remains as it was. The old life that we lived so fondly together is untouched, unchanged. Whatever we were to each other, that we are still. Call me by the old familiar name. Speak of me in the easy way which you always used. Put no sorrow in your tone. Laugh as we always laughed at the little jokes that we enjoyed together. Play, smile, think of me, pray for me. Let my name be ever the household word that it always was. Let it be spoken without effort. Life means all that it ever meant. It is the same as it ever was. There is unbroken continuity. Why should I be out of mind because I am out of sight? I am but waiting for you, for an interval, somewhere very near, just around the corner. All is well. Nothing is hurt; nothing is lost. One brief moment and all will be as it was before. How we shall laugh at the trouble of parting, when we meet again. Dan McGuire McGuire

While Santa Claus will be missed in his usual activities around town, like the Santa Claus Parade, he will still be making an appearance at the YMCA to bring joy to kids and help raise funds for the Sudbury YMCA and Elgin St. Mission this December.
 Despite the challenges that COVID-19 has brought, Sudbury Brian Nori, the CEO of Paint Social, has created a safe and magical way for children to visit Santa this year.
 With help from AtmosFX, Nori has been able to help Santa set up a virtual communication station in his workshop so that he can talk to the kids that wanted to visit him in Sudbury all the way from the North Pole.
 Kids will be able to see and interact with Santa and his elves virtually through an interactive projection-mapped display hosted at the Sudbury YMCA.
 "COVID-19 has changed the way we all live our daily lives and limited the way we celebrate special occasions, but it has also given businesses the chance to innovate and create new experiences for people," says Nori.
 "Kids look forward to seeing Santa every year, and I want to help make it possible. There is no reason why COVID-19 should stop children from enjoying the holidays when we have the ability to reinvent traditional activities and make them safe."
 Santa is making his appearance through a fundraiser put on by the YMCA and Elgin Street Mission called Passport to the Holidays. The passports will give children access to special gifts, treats, and activities that will be set up in various downtown businesses, including the Monique Legault Studio, The Candy Store, Studio 35 Fashions, Huckleberries Chocolatiers, All About Massage & Laser Services, The Cedar Nest Decor Cafe, Stitch and Stone, and Querney's Office Plus.
 There will also be special private performances for each family from local high school students, and draws to enter for children to win prize packs.
 Passports are on sale for $20 per child at the Sudbury YMCA with 100 per cent of proceeds being donated to the Sudbury YMCA and the Elgin Street Mission.
 The passports will be available for children to use during the first three Saturdays in December from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., and will require families to book the day the passport is being used in advance to keep foot traffic in businesses within COVID-safe limits.
 YMCA of Northeastern Ontario is a charity dedicated to the growth of all persons in spirit, mind and body with a sense of responsibility to each other and the global community.

In his 2005 autobiography ‘Straight from the Force’s Mouth’, Prowse wrote, “If the suit was a problem, then the Darth Vader mask, which became such a Star Wars trademark, was nothing short of a nightmare. Once it was fitted, I became virtually blind, and the heat generated by the suit obeyed the laws of physics and travelled upwards, straight into the mask. This immediately misted up the eyepieces, which was inconvenient, to say the least, but was not an insurmountable problem so long as I could look down through the triangular cut-out beneath the mask’s nose moulding and use it as a spyhole.”

_Roma, 27 nov 19:23 - (Agenzia Nova)_ \- Diciassette Regioni, secondo i dati al 24 novembre, superano almeno una soglia critica in area medica o terapia intensiva. È quanto emerge dall'ultimo monitoraggio del ministero della Salute e dell'Istituto superiore di sanità. "Nel caso si mantenga l’attuale trasmissibilità - si legge in una sintesi - quasi tutte le Regioni hanno una probabilità maggiore del 50 per cento di superare almeno una di queste soglie entro il prossimo mese. Complessivamente, il numero di persone ricoverate in terapia intensiva è salito da 3.612 (17 novembre) a 3.816 (24 novembre), mentre il numero di persone ricoverate in aree mediche è passato da 33.074 (17 novembre) a 34.577(24 novembre)". Secondo il monitoraggio, nella settimana presa in esame quasi tutte le Regioni sono ancora classificate a rischio alto di una epidemia non controllata e non gestibile sul territorio o a rischio moderato con alta probabilità di progredire a rischio alto nelle prossime settimane. In particolare, si legge nella sintesi, "dieci Regioni/Pa sono classificate a rischio alto di una trasmissione di Sars-Cov-2. Di queste, una è considerata a rischio alto a titolo precauzionale in quanto non valutabile in modo attendibile per completezza del dato di sorveglianza insufficiente al momento della valutazione anche per la stima dell’Rt". Secondo il monitoraggio, le rimanenti Regioni "sono classificate a rischio moderato di cui sette con una probabilità elevata di progredire a rischio alto nel prossimo mese e presentano una trasmissibilità calcolata al 4 novembre compatibile con uno scenario di trasmissione 2 in due di queste e con uno scenario di tipo 1 per la rimanente".

To do that, time spent on the sideline needs to have made Trubisky a different player. He has to make the kind of transformation Derek Carr made in Las Vegas. The Raiders brought in Marcus Mariota, another bust, this offseason, and no one loves to recycle quarterbacks more than Jon Gruden. Carr has been more confident this season, more decisive and aggressive with the willingness to cut it loose.
 Carr too often last season took the underneath option, getting the ball out of his hands quickly when guys were open over the top. The Raiders brought in Nelson Agholor, who has rediscovered his game, and drafted Henry Ruggs, who runs a 4.2 40-yard dash, and the offense has changed. The Raiders never are going to be a 40-pass-a-game team by choice with Gruden. But they needed a quarterback who was willing to take the shots when they're available and make strong, decisive throws. That's what Carr has done. He also clearly has improved in the pocket. When he felt pressure in the past, he bailed the pocket and tried to make a second-reaction play. Now he's manipulating the pocket. He's climbing. He's sliding. His eyes are down the field, and he's ripping the ball off.

The Van Buren City Council has approved a parking ordinance for certain streets in Van Buren. This plan has been in the works since August, and has finally been approved.
   
 Van Buren Planning Director Wally Bailey said in a previous report that the police and fire departments have had trouble with their vehicles on streets that had become too narrow due to parking.
   
 This particular ordinance is an amendment to an ordinance from 1972 adding a new list of streets to the previous list from that year. A planning commission meeting was held for the public where the restrictions for certain streets were discussed.
   
 The ordinance states that parking on certain streets within the city of Van Buren poses a danger to vehicles utilizing the roadway and impedes access for emergency personnel.
   
 "The parking ordinance is necessary for our fire apparatus to safely and timely respond to emergencies," said Fire Chief Tim Arnold. "The parking ordinance will not allow residents to park their vehicles on the street. This allows for a safer and more unobstructed response for our equipment."
   
 Arnold went on to say that the department has had delays responding on occasion when owners have parked vehicles on both sides of the street and the fire trucks could barely pass between the parked cars. Vehicles parked in the street in cul-de-sacs do not leave enough space for our fire trucks to make it through the circle without backing up to complete the revolution, he added.
   
 The cul-de-sacs are designed to have enough space for the turning radius for fire department equipment but with vehicles parked on the streets it makes it more difficult to respond quickly and safely, he said.
   
 Streets within this ordinance include all blocks of Alma Boulevard, Azure Hills, Fir Drive, Flat Rock Drive, Industrial Park Road, Legacy Boulevard, Rena Road, Vista Hills, North 11th Street, North 20th Street, North 28th Street, South 11th Street, South 28th Street, South 40th Street, and the access road.
   
 Also included are All Cul-de-sacs within the city: Arkansas Street from Knox Street to Prospect Avenue; Breckenridge Drive From North 16th Street to Durango Drive; Durango Drive from Legacy Boulevard to Breckenridge Drive; North Hills Boulevard from Pointer Trail West to Deer Trail as well as Rena Road to Northridge Drive; Northridge Drive from Quarry Drive to Oliver Springs Road; Pevehouse Road from Rena Road to Sandstone Drive; Poplar Street from Arkansas Street to North 20th Street; Sandstone Drive from North Hills Boulevard to Pevehouse Road; as well as Sandstone East from Highway 59 to Legacy Drive. Finally, North Ninth Street from Mickibben Street to Pointer Trail East and North 16th Street from Pointer Trail to city limits.

Restaurants make or break their profitability on packed Friday and Saturday nights. Fortunately, SOME of them were able to create some outdoor seating in the warm summer days. Winter’s here. None of them can do that now.
 Last week the unelected LCDPHE board voted to escalate their business-crushing authoritarianism from “Level 2” (yellow) to “Level 4” (red). This closes all bars, closes all indoor service at restaurants, stops all indoor events among other restrictions. They put no end date on their tyrannical order.
 Businesses that were barely hanging on will go out of business. The Christmas bonus for those families depending on paychecks from them will be a pink slip and unemployment. At least Scrooge only ruined the Cratchit family’s Christmas.
 I have spoken to several of these restaurant owners and each one told me the unsolicited story of employees breaking down into tears in front of them. They can’t lose their jobs and still make ends meet. Many have worked at that place for years; they’re family. If the owners didn’t defy the law, there’d be no presents under the tree for their children.
 If they followed the law many would go out of business anyway. A Hobson’s choice.
 But “follow the science” say the little tyrants to justify everything they do.
 And sure enough, COVID cases are up in Larimer county, but the hot zone is Colorado State University. Good for those kids. They have near-zero chance of being hospitalized and even less chance of dying. Let them power this through to immunity and keep them away from the vulnerable in the meantime.
 But cases of COVID in the city of Loveland (which has the poor fortune of being located in Larimer county not liberty-respecting Weld) are few and far between.
 I wrote this column just before Thanksgiving Day. By the time you read this those Loveland Lawless could have been beaten into submission. Or they could still be trying to hold on, hopefully inspiring other business owners around the state to do the same.
 I hope you’ll support them. It’s worth the drive north to dine at the Loveland Chophouse, McGraff’s, Senior Raphel, Wicked Tequila Room, Grimm Brothers Brewhouse, CJ’s Patio Grill, AKA Kitchen, Cactus Grill and lots of other bars, brewhouses and restaurants.
 If they are forced to close, I hope these Loveland Lawless will do what city governments do actually support — peaceful protests that tear down statues, vandalize, firebomb police cars and smash the windows of their own, former businesses.

I have met many medicine students who are way more depressed than a homeless person who is struggling to make ends meet and this is because most of these students have chosen medicine because their parents told them to do so. Because they want society to call them “Doctors”. When I say we need to have impact on society, what I mean is to have impact with what we do and not let society make us do something, there is a big difference and we need to understand it. The five daily prayers are an obligation on us and we even find excuses to skip them which again are lies. Procrastination is a leaking bucket in the way of our success. Keep that smartphone in your drawer when you work towards your goal not only your smartphone but all the things/ persons that are acting as a distraction, well of course you can’t keep people in the drawer but you can stop hanging with them.

Herb Kauvar, a driving force behind two iconic Boulder, Colorado businesses for more than three decades, died Oct. 24, 2020 at home. He was 93. "He just ran out of gas," says his son, Rick Kauvar. Herbert Sanders Kauvar was born May 17, 1927 in Altoona, Pa. to William and Bessie Silverstein, the youngest of three boys. Herb grew up in Geneva, Ohio, where he was a natural athlete, excelling in basketball, in particular. In 1944, he graduated from Geneva High School and requested permission from his parents to join the U.S. Navy at age 17. He was assigned to a destroyer as a signalman and was en route to Japan when the atomic bombs were dropped in August 1945. "He got shore leave to go into Tokyo, but he saw the state of the people, turned around and never set foot in Japan. It was too awful," says his son Jim Kauvar. Given an early discharge as part of the nation's post-World War II demobilization, Herb attended Ohio State University on the G.I. Bill, earning a degree in business. He went on to earn a Master's in Business Administration from the University of Pittsburgh. He met Gilda Marks in 1948, and two years later, they were married. The newlyweds headed west to Denver to work in a newly formed business selling aluminum doors and custom furniture. Two years later he returned to Ashtabula Ohio to work for his father at the family shoe business in Geneva, until it was sold in 1959. The family moved to Boulder in 1960 when his father-in-law, Monroe Marks, and brother-in-law Floyd asked him to manage The Sink, a thriving 3.2-beer bar and grill adjacent the University of Colorado campus they had purchased in 1954. Herb, Gilda and their three children settled in a small rented house on 29th street in Martin Acres. With major assists along the way from his family and a series of talented and devoted student employees and managers, The Sink survived the '60s and '70s in various incarnations. During its heyday, The Sink sold more bottled 3.2 beer than anywhere else in the USA, and in 1968 Chuck Morris arrived on scene as manager and began experimenting with Friday Afternoon Club live-music events. "(Herb) changed my life. It was the heyday of The Sink," Morris, a Colorado Music Hall of Fame inductee, said in a 2019 interview. The Sink soon began hosting and promoting scheduled live music upstairs in the newly constructed Fawcet Room. "From 1968 to 1970, the Sink hosted events and local bands including Chris Daniels, Tommy Bolin and Zephyr, TK Little, and others," Morris said. "Downstairs, we only had one band, which was the second appearance of CU dropouts, Flash Cadillac and The Continental Kids. "But the mainstay was still the very customized jukebox of 45s, cold Coors beer and Sinkburgers," Rick says. In 1969, Morris and Herb teamed up to resurrect the once-popular, but by then shuttered, Tulagi. "The Tule," which sold more tap 3.2 Coors beer than anywhere in the country was soon hosting future superstars, from the Eagles to ZZ Top and Bonnie Raitt, making it one of the nations top music venues. Herb sold the Tulagi in 1973 and in 1974 he decided to remodel The Sink and rechristen it Herbie's Deli (the name of a sandwich shop he had opened above Tulagi). While his younger son Jim managed the restaurant, Herb branched out and started Commercial Business Brokers that specialized in selling businesses and business opportunities. As the deli business/ 3.2 beer industry declined in the late '80s, Rick and Jim decided to bring back the classic Sink, with updated wall caricatures and all inspired during a trip to Zihuatanejo, Mexico in 1989. The original characters on the walls of the Sink were painted in the '50s by Mike Dormer including the iconic Angel and Devil over the bar's entrance. Herb had made sure the original artwork was preserved under the barn wood paneling that was installed during the 1974 remodeling. "My brother had the vision to bring back the history and to put in a 21 (and over) bar," Jim says. "Dad had fought us over that idea for years." Herb ultimately, if not reluctantly, agreed to remodel and resurrect The Sink --concerned that nobody would remember it! Following the removal of the wood paneling, Llloyd Kavich returned to Boulder to restore his earlier creations. The updated Sink, now with a full bar, and opened that fall now managed and owned by Rick and Jim. After a few years of "robust" business, the brothers sold the restaurant in 1992, ending the family's involvement after nearly 40 years. "We were good caretakers of the Sink's history, and we passed on something that is appreciated by students and alumni today," Jim says. In the late '60s and early '70s Herb invested in several residential properties on University Hill, income from which supported him and Gilda for many years. Gilda died April 18, 1993. Herb remarried in 1995 to Eunice Perlman who died in 2018. Herb was one of the founders of the Boulder Jewish Fellowship, now known as Congregation Har HaShem, when it opened in 1965. "Do you know what Har HaShem means?" Herb said in a 2012 interview. "Mountain of God. That's what it means. And that's where... our burial place is." Herb was a huge fan of Ohio State and CU sports and inspired his sons' love of fishing. He also loved playing golf and continued enjoying the sport into his 90's. "He was a very good golfer. We buried him in his golf shoes and put his putter in the casket," Jim says. At Herb's request, the family made sure that Glenn Miller's "In the Mood" was playing when he was buried next to his wife Gilda at Green Mountain Cemetery. Herb is survived by his sons, Rick Kauvar of Niwot, and Jim Kauvar of Lafayette; a daughter, Gigi Buchanan and her husband Frank, of Mercer Island, Wash.; five grandchildren, Matthew Buchanan, Kendra Buchanan, Lindsay Kauvar Buchanan, Griffin Kauvar and Grant Kauvar; and one great-granddaughter. He was preceded in death by his parents; two brothers; and his second wife, Eunice. The family plans to hold a memorial event "bringing in all the old Sink Rats" and assorted luminaries from the Colorado music scene, at a date to be determined when G Brown's Colorado Music Experience podcast will be debuted. Memorial contributions may be made to the Boulder County Humane Society at boulderhumane.org or The Colorado Golf Hall of Fame at 720-581-3390

Udhampur-Ramban section has been allotted to M/S Gammon India by NHAI through a bidding process several years back. The company is one of the largest infrastructure construction companies in India but the company along with few others have been accused of dumping muck inside Chenab river. The company was also accused of dumping muck in Devika river near Moudh Udhampur where it has set up a stone crushing unit inside the river bed. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) took serious notice of this a few years back. In a recent hearing of the case the NGT has once again lambasted the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the company. NGT pulled up NHAI and the executing agency for dumping large quantities of muck into the Chenab river at several spots. NGT even directed the J&K Pollution Control Board (PCB) to take stringent measures in this regard as in past the PCB had shown a lukewarm attitude towards NHAI and the executing agency. NGT bench comprising chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel in his order issued around October this year said that J&K Pollution Control Board (PCB) may proceed with the recovery of compensation for the damage and initiate prosecution against the violators of environmental norms following the due process of law. The case has now been listed on March 31st 2021. Will PCB adhere to NGT's orders , the time will tell ?

A year older, Sanchez has plenty more experience than Rodon. However, the Welshman has been getting the nod ahead of the Colombian on the bench in recent Premier League matches - he's not registered in Europe - and that suggests he's ahead in the pecking order.
 The other call to be made is who starts on the right of the attack and whether it's Gareth Bale, Lucas Moura or Bergwijn.
 The latter did well against City, Lucas scored in midweek and while Bale was not at his best in that Europa League match he does have big game experience and the fans would love to see Bale, Kane and Son unleashed together against their London rivals.
 However, it's also worth noting that Bale went off down the tunnel as soon as he came off on Thursday night and Sunday might come too soon for him.

Republicans will probably hold the line in the Senate and have picked up a number of seats in the House of Representatives. This election was a significant victory for Republicans, yet Trump, the head of the Republican Party, lost by a margin of almost 4%.
 There is no mystery here and certainly no fraud. Trump lost fair and square, and it is time for all of us to move on.

She wore "Play Like A Girl" on the back of her helmet. The senior will get to keep the No. 32 jersey she wore Saturday, the same as her number when playing soccer.
 Fuller even gave a halftime pep talk, which she usually left to her soccer teammates, telling her new teammates that Vandy won the SEC soccer tournament title by cheering for each other whether on the field or the sideline.
 "We had a different mindset coming out the second half," quarterback Mike Wright said.
 After her kickoff, reaction poured in on social media. Fuller was the No. 2 trending topic on Twitter, followed by Vandy. Her soccer team wrote on Twitter: "Glass. Everywhere."
 As in glass ceiling.
 Pat McAfee, a former NFL punter, reviewed Fuller's squib kick, noting the ball didn't go out of bounds and there was no chance of a return, setting up the defense.
 "Congrats to (at)SarahFuller-27 for being THE FIRST EVER WOMAN TO KICKOFF A POWER 5 GAME," McAfee wrote. "Incredibly rare to be the '1st ever person to do something' these days..this is really cool."
 No woman had appeared in an SEC football game or for any Power Five team. Liz Heaston became the first woman to score with two extra points for Willamette in NAIA on Oct. 18, 1997.
 Katie Hnida was the first woman to score at the Football Bowl Subdivision level with two extra points for New Mexico on Aug. 30, 2003.
 April Goss was the second, with an extra point for Kent State in 2015. Tonya Butler was the first woman to kick a field goal in an NCAA game for Division II West Alabama on Sept. 13, 2003. New Mexico congratulated Fuller on Twitter for joining Hnida and Goss for kicking in an FBS game.
 "Welcome to the club, (at)April-Goss and I are waiting with snacks!" Hnida wrote on Twitter on Friday.
 Missouri coach Eli Drinkwitz visited with Fuller before kickoff and repeated a message that Fuller has heard a lot in recent days. The father of four daughters told Fuller it was incredible they watched her make history.
 "I've had girl dads come up to me and they're like, 'You're inspiring my little girls, and I want them to know that they can do anything and you're proving that point.' And I think that has been the coolest thing," Fuller said.
 Fuller also made clear she'd be up for continuing to help the football team if needed. She believes she can refine her timing and technique with more practice.
 Vanderbilt (0-8) visits No. 13 Georgia next week.
 "If she wants to kick and she's available, we'd love to have her," Mason said.

Prowse also attributed to his years spent in the body building business to his success portraying Darth Vader. “Body acting and body building are more closely related than most people would imagine, and all that posing I’d done to impress the judges in my early years began to pay dividends. From within the black leather suit, I treated Vader’s every gesture as a bodybuilding pose, refining here and exaggerating there, until my character ‘spoke’ with every tilt of his head and movement of his arms,” he wrote in his autobiography. “When I watch those ‘Star Wars’ movies (which I still do, from time to time) I’m quietly pleased at the amount of expression that Vader manages to convey without a facial expression to his name, save for the fixed menace of that mask.”

"History is just journalism and you know how reliable that is."
   
 Joseph Campbell
   
 My senior year in journalism school I signed up for a 5-credit-hour class on Foreign Correspondent Newswriting.
   
 I had no intention of ever becoming a foreign correspondent. The idea of sweating things out in a country that lacked air conditioning and McDonald's hamburgers did not appeal to me. I just wanted to schedule a class before lunch, so I could fill up my morning and call it a day.
   
 It didn't work out.
   
 The first thing the professor announced was that all students needed to be proficient in a foreign language to remain in his class. He then went around the room asking each student to declare their "other" language.
   
 I had not counted on this and was concocting a narrative that my life's ambition was to be an Associated Press reporter in London, when another guy beat me to it.
   
 "English doesn't count," the silver haired professor said gravely. "You're out."
   
 Finally, he got to me.
   
 "Kirby?"
   
 "Yes, sir?"
   
 "Your language?"
   
 "Latin," I said, identifying a subject I had barely passed in earlier collegiate semesters.
   
 He looked at me and sarcastically asked, "And who publishes newspapers in Latin?"
   
 "The Vatican," I said triumphantly.
   
 Suppressed snickers indicated I had class support, but not from his hindness.
   
 "You're out," he said.
   
 Darn Romans. They once conquered the world but Latin held no sway in Journalism 543. I left to sign up for something else I'd never use.
   
 Of course, that's the way it is. Cultures and civilizations come and go, rise and fall, wax and wane. Some leave us with buried trinkets or broken temples or epic legends.
   
 Some leave us their words and those seem to last. Latin still lingers, weaving its way through modern English, smoothing out the harshness of Teutonic tones.
   
 It doesn't stop there. English is a language of many contributions. Take the Arawaks or Taino people of the Caribbean. Dominant half a millennium ago, they were overwhelmed by European explorers and treasure hunters.
   
 They live on, however, in their language, giving us words such as "hurricane," "barbecue," "tobacco" and "hammock."
   
 Likewise most of the rivers and streams of Georgia were named by Native Americans before Europeans showed up with axes to build subdivisions named for the trees they cut down.
   
 Words seem to matter because words last. They are not only passed along, they are passed down. They might be altered or mangled or misused or misplaced, but they don't rust.
   
 Like it or not, it's the most probable thing we'll give to the future, the contributions of foreign correspondents notwithstanding.

SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) - Faulting inaction in Washington, governors and state lawmakers are racing to get pandemic relief to small- business owners, the unemployed, renters and others whose livelihoods have been upended by the widening coronavirus outbreak.In some cases, elected officials are spending the last of a federal relief package passed in the spring as an end-of-year deadline approaches and the fall COVID-19 surge threatens their economies anew. Democrats have been the most vocal in criticizing President Donald Trump and the GOP-controlled Senate for failing to act, but many Republican lawmakers are also sounding the alarm.Underscoring the need for urgency, the number of new COVID-19 cases reported in the United States reached 205,557 on Friday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University – the first time its daily figure topped the 200,000 mark. Its previous daily high was 196,000 on Nov. 20.The total number of cases reported in the U.S., since the first one in January, has topped 13 million.The Democratic governors of Colorado and New Mexico convened special legislative sessions in the closing days of November to address the virus-related emergency. Earlier this week, the New Mexico Legislature passed a bipartisan relief bill that will deliver a one-time $1,200 check to all unemployed workers and give up to $50,000 to certain businesses.Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said the state took action to help residents “who have real issues about keeping food on their table, a roof over their head.”“While the United States of America is on fire, the Trump administration has left states to fight this virus on their own,” she said, noting state efforts alone simply are not enough. “It is clear no help is coming — not from this president, not from this administration. As we have done every day this year, New Mexico will step up.”In Colorado, a special session scheduled for Monday will consider roughly $300 million in relief to businesses, restaurants and bars, child-care providers, landlords, tenants, public schools and others.“Even as cases have exploded across the country, Congress and the president have not yet passed much-needed relief for people,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in announcing the session. “Here in Colorado, we want to do the best with what we have to take care of our own.”In New Jersey and Washington state, Republicans who are a minority in both legislatures were the ones pushing for special sessions. They want to direct more money to struggling small-business owners.Republican lawmakers in Wisconsin, who control both houses of the Legislature, are considering whether to return in December to address effects of the latest coronavirus wave after Democratic Gov. Tony Evers put forward a $500 million COVID-19 relief bill earlier this week. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, plans to convene lawmakers in December to contend with the virus, partially at Republicans’ urging.“Senate Republicans are committed to recovering our economy that has been harmed by broad and prolonged shutdowns,” Minnesota Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka said in a statement. “We will work with anyone to find solutions.”State government leaders want Trump and Congress to extend the Dec. 30 deadline for spending virus relief money already allocated under the CARES Act, which was approved in March, and to provide more federal funding to deal with the consequences of the latest surge.“It’s just heartbreaking what they’re allowing to happen with no federal government intervention,” said Washington state House Speaker Laurie Jinkins, a Democrat.In making his decision to call the Minnesota Legislature into special session, Walz cited “a sense of urgency” around doing something on the state level due to the lack of a federal response.The Minnesota Council of Nonprofits reported that more than half of the state’s charitable organizations received forgivable loans through the CARES Act’s Paycheck Protection Program this year, while another $12 million from the CARES Act is going to organizations that provide food to the needy. But all that will be spent — or lost — by the end of December without congressional action.“I would reiterate to our federal partners — to the outgoing administration and to the incoming Biden administration — please work together, please find a compromise in there, please. If you have to, move a package now with the idea that you will come back and move one later,” Walz said. “COVID is not going to end at the end of the month. We are in an unrelenting spike.”In Ohio, where Republicans control every branch of government, Gov. Mike DeWine and legislative leaders pushed a $420 million pandemic spending package through a special bipartisan panel late last month. Funded through the CARES Act, it offered grants to small businesses, bars and restaurants, low-income renters, arts groups, and colleges and universities.Pennsylvania House Majority Leader Kerry Benninghoff, a Republican, gives credit to the federal government for the billions in aid previously sent out, but he said small businesses and people who have lost work need more federal assistance.“The election’s over,” Benninghoff said. “This is not a time for finger-pointing.”In neighboring New Jersey, the partisan divide over $4 billion in COVID-19 borrowing backed by the Democratic governor and Legislature prompted a court challenge by minority Republicans. The state’s high court sided with Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration, citing the unprecedented nature of the outbreak.Even so, Murphy has regularly pleaded with Congress for more aid.“It’s shameful that they have not acted in Congress, especially (Senate Majority Leader Mitch) McConnell and the Republican Senate, to throw a lifeline to small businesses,” he said.Republicans have proposed a $300 million aid package to small businesses and nonprofits, but the legislation is stalled. GOP lawmakers told the governor if he does not call a special session to address the need, many businesses and charities “might not survive the winter.”Having already committed the bulk of their virus relief allotment, lawmakers in one state, Illinois, were forced to end the year with an unaddressed $3.9 billion budget deficit. They canceled what would be their regular fall session in November, citing the health threat posed by the virus, and expressed hope for help from the nation’s capital when they return.“If the federal government doesn’t stand up and step in, we’re in a very bad situation — for our schools, colleges and universities, health care programs, child care, senior services,” House Majority Leader Greg Harris, a Democrat, said. “This isn’t like all the blue states are hurting and all the red states are humming along. Everybody’s in bad shape.”___Carr Smyth reported from Columbus, Ohio.

William Lecil Henderson, II June 11, 1958 - November 22, 2020 Charlotte, North Carolina - William Lecil Henderson II, 62, passed away suddenly on November 22, 2020. Lecil was born on June 11, 1958, in Charlotte, the son of Lecil and Ruth Henderson. He was a graduate of Charlotte Country Day and Wake Forest University. After graduation from Wake Forest, Lecil returned to Charlotte, married his wife Kathryn, and raised two sons and a daughter. Lecil was proud to be a Charlotte native, and he loved his city passionately. Over the years, Lecil participated in and led many community activities, including serving as president of Leadership Charlotte and as president of the Historic Properties Commission. He also served as a deacon at his church, Myers Park Presbyterian. He enjoyed coaching his children in sports, and he was always up for chaperoning a field trip or a camping expedition. Lecil loved to travel, especially with his family, and he had a particular love for the North Carolina mountains. In recent years, he enjoyed renting houses in the North Carolina mountains, at the beach, and in Charleston, SC, where the whole family could stay, gathering for long dinners and hours of conversation and laughter. Lecil began his career in jewelry in high school, assisting his father. Eventually, in 1990, Lecil founded the Henderson Collection by Lecil. Owning a small business is a time-consuming venture, and Lecil put his heart and soul into building the business from scratch into a well-established company known throughout the jewelry industry. He was a highly innovative designer, creating extensive collections of hand- crafted, customizable pieces, including his groundbreaking and unique colored golds and enamels, which became instant best-sellers. He delighted in putting the perfect piece of jewelry into a customer's hands. Not only did he make sure to provide the stores he dealt with incredible personalized service, but he got to know many of their customers, many of whom collected his pieces, and extended his care to them. The jewelry industry is a tight-knit community, and Lecil not only made numerous friends but worked tirelessly to improve the state of the industry. He was a founding member and board member of Luxury by JCK, a founding member of Centurion Show, a board member of the Centurion Show by Invitation Only, a Southern Jewelry Travelers Association member, a NC Jewelers Association member, an Alabama Jewelers Association member, a 24K Club of Southern California member, and a 24K Club Southeastern United States board member and member. Lecil is survived by his wife, Kathryn Harrill Henderson; sons, William Henderson and Andrew Henderson; daughter, Elizabeth Henderson; sister, Sherry Henderson; sister-in-law, Myra Harrill Childers; nephew, David Rackley; and many, many friends. He was predeceased by his parents, Lecil and Ruth Henderson. A service to celebrate Lecil's life will be held at a later date, when it is safe for all his loved ones and friends to gather. Donations in Lecil's name may be made to A Child's Place, a Charlotte- based organization which works to erase the impact of homelessness on children and their education. Hankins and Whittington Funeral Service of Charlotte is in charge of arrangements.

A look at the numbers demonstrate how self-centered and outright delusional Cuomo has been while exploiting the plight of thousands in an attempt to make himself look good. He even released a book, “American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the Covid-19 Pandemic.”
 In reality, New York is far and away the leader in Covid deaths, with over 34,000, according to data posted by the New York Times, compared to slightly over 21,000 deaths in Texas, second on the list. This despite New York having a smaller population than Texas, California and Florida—all of which have had more cases and fewer deaths than New York. Cuomo, of course, has been criticized for his decision that led to thousands of deaths in nursing homes. Yes, give the man an Emmy. What a leader.

The plump, big-breasted turkeys that appeared on millions of American kitchen tables this Thanksgiving are far different than the smaller, much rarer turkey breeds that once made up the majority of the nation’s commercial turkey flock.
 Now known as “heritage turkeys,” many of the ancient breeds almost went extinct in the late 1990s. But those colorful, playful and spritely bird breeds are on the rebound as a small group of niche farmers in South Dakota and beyond are once again breeding, raising and selling heritage turkeys as part of a growing farm-to-table agricultural movement.
 Breeding stock of heritage turkeys such as Auburn, Buff, Black, Bourbon Red, Narragansett, Royal Palm, Slate, Standard Bronze, and Midget White totaled just 1,335 in 1997, according to a census taken by The Livestock Conservancy of Pittsboro, N.C.

ROMA (ITALPRESS) – Il taglio dei brindisi di fine anno a tavola per effetto del coprifuoco, della chiusura dei ristoranti e dei limiti ai festeggiamenti nella case rischia di dare il colpo di grazia ai consumi di vino e spumanti che nel 2020 fanno registrare un crollo fuori casa del 40% per una perdita complessiva di quasi 1,4 miliardi di euro. E’ quanto emerge da una stima della Coldiretti sull’impatto dell’estensione per DPCM del coprifuoco delle 10,00 alle feste di Natale a Capodanno nonchè della chiusura di tutti i bar e ristoranti alle 18 anche nelle regioni meno a rischio come le gialle.   “Le feste di fine anno fanno registrare tradizionalmente il massimo di domanda di spumanti e vino italiani ma a pesare oltre al lockdown per ristoranti e locali pubblici sono – sottolinea la Coldiretti – soprattutto il divieto alle feste private e ai tradizionali veglioni ma anche i limiti posti agli spostamenti, dal coprifuoco e l’invito ad evitare gli assembramenti a tavola”. “Il settore del vino e degli spumanti è quello più colpito a tavola dalle limitazioni dei festeggiamenti anche nelle case con gli italiani che dovranno dire addio ai pranzi e cenoni da 9 persone in media che hanno segnato il Natale ed il Capodanno nel 2019”, secondo l’indagine Coldiretti/Ixè. “Il risultato è un taglio netto dei consumi rispetto ai circa 74 milioni di tappi di spumante stappati solo in Italia per le feste di fine anno nel 2019”, secondo la Coldiretti.   “Se in Italia, nonostante gli ultimi cambi di colore in Italia restano chiusi 2 bar, ristoranti, pizzerie e agriturismi su 3 per un totale di oltre 215mila locali situati nelle regioni rosse e arancioni dove è proibita qualsiasi attività al tavolo, a pesare anche all’estero – continua la Coldiretti – è il clima più sobrio con la serrata di bar e ristoranti in paesi importanti per le esportazioni di vino e spumanti tricolori. Per l’Italia il 2020 si chiuderà con un taglio stimato pari al 4,6% delle esportazioni di vino e bollicine rispetto all’anno precedente per effetto del calo negli Stati Uniti (-2% a valore) e Germania (-3%,), i due principali consumatori di vino italiano all’estero”. “Ad essere danneggiata – sottolinea la Coldiretti – è soprattutto la vendita di vini di alta qualità che trova un mercato privilegiato di sbocco in bar, alberghi e ristoranti”.   “Un colpo pesante che si aggiunge – precisa la Coldiretti – a quello derivante da blocchi o limitazioni di altre attività che sono direttamente o indirettamente connesse al consumo di vino, come feste, matrimoni, convegni, congressi, fiere e spettacoli”. “A livello nazionale la Coldiretti è impegnata nella campagna #iobevoitaliano per promuovere gli acquisti ma serve anche sostenere le imprese con massicci investimenti pubblici e privati anche per la ripresa delle esportazioni con il vino che rappresenta un elemento di traino dell’intero Made in Italy sui mercati mondiali” conclude il Presidente della Coldiretti Ettore Prandini, nel sostenere l’esigenza di “un piano strategico per l’internazionalizzazione necessaria per sostenere la ripresa”.

A solução foi avançar para leilão, onde todo o património da empresa foi apresentado com um valor mínimo de quatro milhões e 50 mil euros, incluindo imóveis, mobiliário, moldes, matrizes e patentes. O processo arrastou-se durante anos. Atento, Victor Pais, proprietário da concorrente Maber, acabou por comprar máquinas e moldes, inicialmente com o objetivo de reforçar a capacidade produtiva da própria fábrica. No final, sem ambições financeiras e movido apenas pelo gosto de reerguer um nome quase extinto, ficou com os meios necessários para voltar a produzir os artigos da histórica marca portuguesa.
 Paralelamente, desde 2006, a Iberopartners – empresa detida por Jorge Armindo, ele próprio antigo administrador da Molin – permanecia como proprietária do registo da marca. De um lado, o património industrial. Do outro, uma marca reconhecida por todo o país. Com estas duas partes da Molin em diferentes mãos, restou aos dois empresários portugueses chegarem a um entendimento. Em julho de 2017, Victor Pais chegou mesmo a ir ao Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Industrial para pedir a caducidade do registo da marca, recurso legal sempre que uma marca não seja objeto de uso sério durante cinco anos consecutivos. Foi quando esbarrou no nome de Jorge Armindo. “Chegámos a ter reuniões e ele propôs-me uma sociedade. Eu disse que não. Passaram dois anos. Em outubro do ano passado, voltou a propor-me um negócio. Em novembro, comprei-lhe a marca”, explica o novo proprietário.
 Victor Pais nunca esteve tão próximo de fazer regressar os artigos da Molin às prateleiras de papelarias e supermercados. À procura de um espaço para pôr a maquinaria a funcionar, incluindo máquinas específicas para trabalhar com os moldes criados pela marca e outras para fabricar os bicos das esferográficas, o empresário quer começar pelas réguas, esquadros e transferidores, os primeiros produtos a chegar ao mercado. Do outro lado do Atlântico, também continua a existir Molin. A marca começou a ser comercializada no Brasil em 1995 e autonomizou-se após a falência. O logótipo mantém sérias semelhanças com o original, o catálogo soma centenas de referências.
 Em Portugal, o desenlace está longe do fim, já que o imbróglio ganhou, entretanto, uma proporção ibérica.

Since losing a friend in a car accident Jyi Dalli has endeavoured to do more with his life.
 He is now among a surge of Queenslanders who have decided to pursue a career in the fitness industry.
 The number of certificate III in fitness enrolments at TAFE Queensland’s Mooloolaba campus has nearly doubled on this time last year.
 After suffering back and shoulder injuries as a landscaper, Mr Dalli enrolled in the course to help his recovery, but now wants to complete a certificate IV or diploma to become a personal trainer.
 “I’ve always loved the gym and exercising – I started at 17 and it’s always been a constant in my life – but I never thought about it as a career until after COVID-19 hit,” he said.
 “I loved the course from the moment I sat down for orientation.
 “It’s amazing to think how far I’ve come in such a short time. When I’d gone to my physio for my injuries, I had no idea why I was doing certain exercises and how they were supposed to help me. Now, I’m learning why it’s all so important.”

 Mr Dalli thought he had found his passion when he quit a teaching degree to start a landscaping apprenticeship with a small family-run business, but when tragedy struck and his boss Paul passed away unexpectedly, his plans began to unravel.
 “Because it was such a small business everything was left up in the air. I was lucky enough to qualify through another business, then moved on to a commercial building company, but it just wasn’t the same without Paul,” he said.
 “I’d just started at a new business when COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, so when the restrictions came in, I was laid off.”
 Having previously lost one of his close friends in a car accident, Mr Dalli had promised himself he would do more with his life and decided to escape a spiralling depression and use his redundancy as an opportunity to start fresh.
 Having already changed his career path once before, the 22-year-old thought he had found his passion in landscaping – so when he was confronted with the prospect of starting over again, he had no idea where to begin.
 Now seven months on and on the path to a rewarding career in fitness, Mr Dalli said the experience had a silver lining, enabling him to assess his goals and discover his true calling.
 TAFE Queensland Leading Vocational Teacher for Fitness, Brett King attributed the increase to the versatility of the fitness industry.
 “Over the past few years we’ve seen a shift to a more health conscious culture, which I think COVID-19 has accelerated in many ways – people have either used this time to work on their health, or have gone in the opposite direction and are now seeking assistance to get back on the right track,” Mr King said.

 When a taxi deposited Mallory Guy in front of an apartment building in Cheonan, South Korea, groggy and dazed after a 14-hour flight from Atlanta, a Korean couple was waiting for her on the sidewalk with open arms.
 It was the first time since she was 7 months old that Guy, 33, had been in the country where she was born. It was also her first time seeing her birth parents since she was sent to the United States more than three decades ago. They gave her up for adoption when they could not afford the surgery to repair her cleft palate.

NEW DELHI (AP) — Protesting farmers on Sunday rejected the Indian government's offer to hold immediate talks if they ended their blockade of key highways they've held as they seek the scrapping of legislation they say could devastate crop prices. The thousands of farmers will continue camping out on highways in Punjab and Haryana states until three new agriculture laws are withdrawn, Jaskaran Singh, a leader of the Kisan Union, or Farmers’ Union, told reporters. The farmers say the laws could cause the government to stop buying grain at guaranteed prices and result in their exploitation by corporations that would buy their crops cheaply. The government says the legislation brings about much needed reform agriculture that will allow farmers the freedom to market their produce and boost production through private investment. “These reforms have not only served to unshackle our farmers but also given them new rights and opportunities,\" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Sunday. On Friday, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar offered to hold talks with the farmers’ representatives on Dec. 3. That followed a day of clashes with police, who used tear gas, water cannons and baton charges to push them back as they tried to enter New Dehli. The latest offer for talks was made by Home Minister Amit Shah on Saturday. But he said the farmers would have to shift their protests to a government-designated venue in New Delhi and stop blocking the highways. Singh, the farmer's representative, said he doubted the government really wanted to hold talks. \"We want the farm laws to be scrapped, that’s all,” he said. Singh said more farmers would be joining the protest and blocking national highways in other states as well. Farmers have long been seen as the heart and soul...

 Cerca de um mês atrás, a Blizzard anunciou o lançamento mundial de Naxxramas, marcado para 3 de dezembro. Mas, naquela época, a desenvolvedora não especificou exatamente a que horas a reide estaria disponível. A única coisa que sabíamos era que os jogadores teriam acesso naquele dia.
 A Blizzard atualizou os jogadores hoje, porém, dizendo que Naxxramas será desbloqueada em 3 de dezembro às 18h. Para alguns servidores da região asiática, este lançamento é na verdade no início da manhã de 4 de dezembro.
 Quando Naxxramas for desbloqueado, o evento Scourge Invasion do _Classic_ Fase 6 também começará. Isso irá permitir que os jogadores usem “Runas Necróticas” que podem ser usadas para obter “Pedras de Afiação Consagradas” e “Óleos de Arma Abençoados” que serão úteis na luta contra a abundância de monstruosidades mortas-vivas em Naxx.
 Enquanto isso, a postagem da Blizzard hoje incluiu algumas mudanças notáveis ​​na Invasão do Flagelo que estenderá o evento em relação à forma como ocorria originalmente em 2006. Esta extensão da Blizzard tem como objetivo dar aos jogadores mais tempo para conseguir esses materiais por causa do volume nos servidores agora, comparados a 2006, quando a primeira expansão do jogo chegou ao fim.

 # How archaeologists are using deep learning to dig deeper
 By Zach Zorich

 Nov 28, 2020  at 8:39 AM
 Finding the tomb of an ancient king full of golden artifacts, weapons and elaborate clothing seems like any archaeologist’s fantasy. But searching for them, Gino Caspari can tell you, is incredibly tedious.
 Caspari, a research archaeologist with the Swiss National Science Foundation, studies the ancient Scythians, a nomadic culture whose horse-riding warriors terrorized the plains of Asia 3,000 years ago. The tombs of Scythian royalty contained much of the fabulous wealth they had looted from their neighbors. From the moment the bodies were interred, these tombs were popular targets for robbers; Caspari estimates that more than 90% of them have been destroyed.

William Lecil Henderson, II   June 11, 1958 - November 22, 2020   Charlotte, North Carolina - William Lecil Henderson II, 62, passed away suddenly on November 22, 2020. Lecil was born on June 11, 1958, in Charlotte, the son of Lecil and Ruth Henderson. He was a graduate of Charlotte Country Day and Wake Forest University.   After graduation from Wake Forest, Lecil returned to Charlotte, married his wife Kathryn, and raised two sons and a daughter. Lecil was proud to be a Charlotte native, and he loved his city passionately. Over the years, Lecil participated in and led many community activities, including serving as president of Leadership Charlotte and as president of the Historic Properties Commission. He also served as a deacon at his church, Myers Park Presbyterian. He enjoyed coaching his children in sports, and he was always up for chaperoning a field trip or a camping expedition. Lecil loved to travel, especially with his family, and he had a particular love for the North Carolina mountains. In recent years, he enjoyed renting houses in the North Carolina mountains, at the beach, and in Charleston, SC, where the whole family could stay, gathering for long dinners and hours of conversation and laughter.   Lecil began his career in jewelry in high school, assisting his father. Eventually, in 1990, Lecil founded the Henderson Collection by Lecil. Owning a small business is a time-consuming venture, and Lecil put his heart and soul into building the business from scratch into a well-established company known throughout the jewelry industry. He was a highly innovative designer, creating extensive collections of hand-crafted, customizable pieces, including his groundbreaking and unique colored golds and enamels, which became instant best-sellers. He delighted in putting the perfect piece of jewelry into a customer's hands. Not only did he make sure to provide the stores he dealt with incredible personalized service, but he got to know many of their customers, many of whom collected his pieces, and extended his care to them. The jewelry industry is a tight-knit community, and Lecil not only made numerous friends but worked tirelessly to improve the state of the industry. He was a founding member and board member of Luxury by JCK, a founding member of Centurion Show, a board member of the Centurion Show by Invitation Only, a Southern Jewelry Travelers Association member, a NC Jewelers Association member, an Alabama Jewelers Association member, a 24K Club of Southern California member, and a 24K Club Southeastern United States board member and member.   Lecil is survived by his wife, Kathryn Harrill Henderson; sons, William Henderson and Andrew Henderson; daughter, Elizabeth Henderson; sister, Sherry Henderson; sister-in-law, Myra Harrill Childers; nephew, David Rackley; and many, many friends. He was predeceased by his parents, Lecil and Ruth Henderson.   A service to celebrate Lecil's life will be held at a later date, when it is safe for all his loved ones and friends to gather. Donations in Lecil's name may be made to A Child's Place, a Charlotte-based organization which works to erase the impact of homelessness on children and their education. Hankins and Whittington Funeral Service of Charlotte is in charge of arrangements.

Nerves provide the pathways for both motor and sensory signals throughout the body and physical damage to a peripheral nerve or the inability to properly reconnect nerves can result in the loss of muscle function and/or feeling. Nerves can be damaged in a number of ways. When a nerve is cut due to a traumatic injury or surgery, functionality of the nerve may be compromised, causing the nerve to no longer carry the signals to and from the brain to the muscles and skin and reducing or eliminating functionality. Nerve damage or discontinuity of this type generally requires a surgical repair.

Despite a massive vote on Nov. 3 in favor of a new Mississippi state flag that proclaims “In God We Trust,” additional official actions are needed to ensure the death knell for the 126-year-old state flag that features the Confederate battle emblem as part of its design.
 During the 2021 legislative session that begins in January, lawmakers must ratify the new state flag approved by voters on Nov. 3. The bill passed this summer – which retired the old flag and formed a commission to recommend a new design (the “In God We Trust” flag) to be approved or rejected by voters on Nov. 3 – included a little-noticed provision that requires legislators to ratify the action of the voters.
 That means lawmakers must take at least one more vote on the flag in the rapidly approaching legislative session.
 In 2001, during an earlier failed attempt to change the state flag, legislators voted to hold a referendum where the choice would be between the old flag and a new design recommended by a commission. The bill passed by the Legislature that year stated that whatever flag voters approved would be the official flag of the state without any additional action by the Legislature. In 2001, voters overwhelmingly voted to retain the old flag.
 But the bill approved this year states that once voters approved the new design, “the Legislature shall enact into law the new design as the official Mississippi state flag.” Of course, the courts have ruled that the word “shall” does not force legislators to do anything they do not want to do.
 The vote to change the flag this past summer was a difficult one for many legislators to take, and several lawmakers have taken heat for it in their home districts. That begs the question of why language was put into the bill essentially forcing legislators to take yet another vote on the contentious issue. It seems the easier option would have been to mandate that the vote of the people for a new flag would ratify that banner as official.
 As the bill was being crafted in June, concerns were raised about an 1860 Supreme Court case, Alcorn v. Hamer. Some said the ruling in that case could be interpreted to say it was unconstitutional for the Legislature to leave it to a vote of the people to enact general law.
 Despite the controversy surrounding replacing the old flag, there is good reason to believe the ratification of the new flag by the Legislature during the 2021 session will be nothing more than a formality and will perhaps happen early in the session.
 After all, more Mississippians voted for the new state flag on Nov. 3 than voted for President Donald Trump or U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith. Heck, more people voted for the new flag than voted for medical marijuana, which also got more votes than Trump and Hyde-Smith.
 The only ballot item receiving more votes than the new flag this year was the proposal to change the Constitution to remove the language requiring candidates for statewide office to garner both a majority of the popular votes and to win the most votes in a majority of House districts in order to win the election.
 That proposal received 957,420 votes, or 79.2%, in still unofficial returns, while the flag garnered 939,585 vote, or 73.3%. Trump received 756,731 votes, or 57.5%.
 Both the electoral provision that was repealed by voters and the old state flag were remnants of the 1890s, when Mississippi’s white power structure took extraordinary steps to deny basic rights to African Americans. The electoral provision was enacted as a method of preventing Black Mississippians, then a majority in the state, from being elected to statewide office.
 Placing the Confederate battle emblem on the state’s official flag during the same time period, no doubt, was a way for white lawmakers to pay homage to the Civil War in which Southerners fought to preserve slavery.
 Even if the Legislature, as expected, does ratify the new flag in 2021, the controversy may not be quite over. The Let Mississippi Vote political committee plans to try to garner the roughly 100,000 signatures of registered voters needed to place a proposal back on the ballot to allow people to choose between four flags – one being that 126-year-old banner.
 Most likely later this month or early next month, the clock will start ticking on the one-year time frame supporters of that ballot initiative will have to gather the signatures to place the flag proposal on the ballot.
 Whether Mississippians, who voted overwhelmingly for a new flag on Nov. 3, will want to vote again on the contentious issue remains to be seen.

Walking into the mall I ran into a friend of mine. I won’t tell you who he is out of respect for his privacy but he looked like Ebenezer Scrooge after the third ghost of the night finishes their visit. By that I mean tired and ashen, with a look of despair in his normally bright eyes.
 This friend owns half-dozen stores in the greater Capital Region. Again, I won’t go into what kind of stores for the sake of his privacy but I could see in his face before he spoke his lifetime of work was in trouble.
 “How are you doing through all of this?” I asked him. His response was, “Have you got a minute?”
 We stepped out of the foot traffic and he told me when you have six of anything you usually have two that are doing really well, two doing okay and two that are always having issues. I’m convinced this applies to a business, pets or even kids. Of course ,with kids they change positions from year to year, with the one who is on top of the world crashing down after a bad breakup of some other drama.
 But … back to my friend. He told me when the shutdowns started in March he assumed, like most of us, this might be a couple of weeks or maybe a month tops. By summer, most of us were certain we’d have this virus sorted out or contained.
 My how naïve we all were.
 My pal told me by July he knew two of his six stores were doomed and would not survive this. By September he knew four of the six were probably finished. And now, the week of Thanksgiving and heading into the busiest shopping season of the year? Well, he told me his two top performing stores were also in quicksand and not likely to pull out of this.
 I understand the need to stop the virus and at least early on I understood the necessity of the lockdowns. I’m just wondering, with the utmost sincerity, if the cure isn’t becoming worse than the disease.

Lecce - Arrivare a 92 anni per andarsene a causa di un incidente a una stufa, tanto banale quanto drammatico. Vincenzo Pulli e morto ieri notte a Squinzano, in Salento, arso vivo nell'incendio della sua casa, in via Salvemini. Secondo quanto ricostruito dai carabinieri, il pensionato si era addormentato quando una fiammata si sarebbe sprigionata dalla vicina stufa, raggiungendo la coperta che aveva sulle gambe. Da qui il fuoco si sarebbe propagato velocemente sul corpo dell'anziano, risvegliandolo di soprassalto. Inutile la fuga disperata in giardino per cercare di spegnere con l'acqua le fiamme che ormai lo avevano avvolto. Non ce l'ha fatta: il fuoco l'ha divorato a meta strada dal rubinetto che l'avrebbe potuto salvare. Quando sono arrivati i vigili del fuoco, allertati dai vicini, lo hanno trovato accasciato a terra, gia privo di vita, coperto di ustioni.

 # Need a hypothesis? A.I. has one

 Machine-learning algorithms seem to have insinuated their way into every human activity short of toenail clipping and dog washing, although the tech giants may have solutions in the works for both. If Alexa knows anything about such projects, she’s not saying.
 But one thing that algorithms presumably cannot do, besides feel heartbreak, is formulate theories to explain human behavior or account for the varying blend of motives behind it. They are computer systems; they can’t play Sigmund Freud or Carl Jung, at least not convincingly. Social scientists have used the algorithms as tools, to number-crunch and test-drive ideas, and potentially predict behaviors — like how people will vote or who is likely to engage in self-harm — secure in the knowledge that ultimately humans are the ones who sit in the big-thinking chair.

That Facebook comment came not from the head of the local teachers’ union or some newly-elected, anti-charter member of the DPS Board. Such sources would be all too predictable. Instead, it came from my state representative in central Denver, Steven Woodrow.
 While I do not personally know Rep. Woodrow, he seems a smart and conscientious guy. My point is not to berate him. Rather, it is to note how way too many Democrats have themselves tied in knots when it comes to education policy and are unable to figure out whom they are there to serve.
 First, to the immediate issue of a DSST Noel High School and the broader mess that is the Denver School Board.
 The fact that there is even a dispute over authorizing a high school for DSST Noel is itself astounding. The DSST Noel Middle School is the top-rated school at that level in the entire district. Get that — it is not just above average or in a high tier of the school performance rankings. It is at the very top of the heap; the best Denver has to offer.
 Further, it is located not in Cherry Creek or University Park or some other upscale enclave that is most usually the site of top-performing schools. Nope, DSST Noel sits in the heart of Montbello, a diverse neighborhood in far northeast Denver with more than its share of challenges. The parents there overwhelmingly want this high school so that their students can continue on an academically superior path. The district had implicitly promised that would be the case.
 Bear in mind that the students at DSST Noel Middle School are over 60 percent Hispanic and 24 percent Black. If Black (and Brown) Lives Matter, maybe it is time to assert that Black (and Brown) Education Matters, too.
 But, apparently, not to this school board which shows itself daily to be rudderless and overmatched. Not content with piling disruption on top of disruption in an already disrupted year, and with violating assurances made to parents and students at this particular school, the board has now effectively run off the first Latino superintendent in the district’s history (mind you, Latinos constitute well over half of all DPS students), and a woman and homegrown, up-through-the-ranks talent, to boot.
 And they did so without the evident foresight to have any kind of succession plan in place.

“I think it would be very unfortunate for elected officials to think they can and should go against the very direct and well stated will of voters in the state,” Goers continued. “I think if they do that, it won’t bode well for them in the long run because voters will take notice.”
 Goers’ comments came before two law enforcement officers filed a lawsuit, asking the courts to overturn Constitutional Amendment A. The amendment legalizes the cultivation, transport, possession and sale of marijuana in the state. Pennington County Sheriff Kevin Thom and S.D. Highway Patrol Superintendent Rick Miller filed the lawsuit alleging that the amendment should have been placed on the ballot by a state convention — something that hasn’t been done since statehood.
 But, Goers stressed that instead of fighting the election outcome, it is paramount for elected officials to work together with responsible cultivation and distribution facilities to ensure the transition is done in a safe manner that provides maximum benefit to the state. According to the legislation, the newly passed legalization will go into effect July 1, but the S.D. Department of Revenue has until April 2022 to draft taxation regulations for what could be South Dakota’s newest cash crop.
 Between now and then, Goers said companies such as Columbia Care stand ready to work with state officials to build cultivation and processing facilities, in order to amass inventory to meet patient demand for medical marijuana use. Medical marijuana is Columbia Care’s primary focus, Goers said, as his company stresses research and development in products.
 “There are patients suffering from debilitating conditions that need first access,” Goers said.
 Once enough marijuana has been cultivated to meet patient demand, Goers said medical dispensaries will be set up around the state. He referred to the dispensaries as resembling a “high-end” doctor’s office, with professional pharmacists on staff, and security that is often provided by retired police officers.
 “They will be part of the community in an additive effect, especially in the medical community,” he said. “They are treating your neighbors who may be suffering from a debilitating condition, including cancer or chronic pain. They’re professionally run and products that are going to be available are tested, grown and produced up to the strictest standards, so the quality, safety and efficacy can be guaranteed for the patient who is going to be consuming them.”

Habitualmente esta efeméride tiene lugar en el Salón de Pasos Perdidos del Palacio del Congreso, donde cada año suelen darse cita en torno a 700 invitados entre miembros del Gobierno, las más altas autoridades del Estado, así como diputados y senadores.
 Sin embargo, las restricciones del aforo que ha traído consigo la pandemia han obligado a la Cámara a pensar un 'plan b' y buscar un espacio que garantice la asistencia de parte de esa representación habitual y la correspondiente distancia de seguridad interpersonal.
 Por ello, Batet decidió 'sacar a la calle' el acto, en concreto a la Carrera de San Jerónimo, desde donde se prevé que pronuncie su tradicional discurso con motivo del aniversario de la Constitución ante las entre 200 y 250 personalidades que el Congreso prevé invitar este año.
 Año tras año, tras ese discurso de la Presidencia, tenían lugar los habituales corrillos, conversaciones informales entre periodistas y políticos, pero este año el Congreso también ha decidido suprimir esta práctica con el fin de evitar las aglomeraciones y, con ellos, los riesgos de contagio del Covid.
 SUSPENDIDAS LAS JORNADAS DE PUERTAS ABIERTAS
 La evolución de la pandemia también ha provocado que el Congreso haya tenido que descartar este año las Jornadas de Puertas Abiertas que se celebran cada año en torno al 6 de diciembre. Estas jornadas, puestas en marcha cuando Federico Trillo ocupó la Presidencia de la Cámara, se vienen realizando desde 1997, por lo que, de celebrarse, la de este año habría sido la edición vigésimo cuarta.
 Se trata de la segunda ocasión en 23 años que el Congreso se ve obligado a suspender este tradicional evento. La primera vez fue en 2012, cuando el entonces presidente, el 'popular' Jesús Posada, decidió no celebrarlas como consecuencia de las obras que se realizaban en el Palacio de la Carrera de San Jerónimo.

 These stories aren't just bad for taxpayers. This approach to contracting, dubbed the "chumocracy," is hurting British businesses too.

KATZ--Gilbert. What a wonderful life! Gilbert Katz was born in 1927 to William and Lottie Katz. William immigrated from Minsk, Belarus during the Russian Revolution. From a young age, Gilbert was driven and hardworking. Not only did he excel in school, but he worked alongside his father in his Dad's shop in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. After graduating from Midwood High School during WWII, Gilbert and a very special group of cadets, who became friends for life, enrolled in The Maritime Academy of New York at Fort Schuyler. The Class of 1947 always joked that the Germans surrendered upon their enrollment, knowing they wouldn't want to face this strong, tenacious class. Gil's ambition and commitment, as well as his strong belief in the value of education, drove him to become the first in his family to attend college. He graduated from the School of Industrial Labor Relations at Cornell University. His class of 1951 became the fourth class to graduate from this esteemed school. Gilbert immediately attended Cornell Law School and graduated in 1953. With these two degrees under his belt and his infamous grit and tenacity, Gilbert returned to New York City where he established a private law practice over the next 50 years and went on to build a highly regarded and successful real estate career. Gil was widely respected in the business world as a man of integrity, distinguished associate, esteemed colleague, mentor, and loyal and devoted friend, but to his family, he was larger than life. A bull in a china shop kind of guy, Gilbert poured his infamous grit and tenacity into loving his family. As the patriarch, he was deeply committed to their education, always mentoring and encouraging them to be their best selves. He was always sure to remind them that life has its challenges, and "pencils have erasers because people make mistakes!" In fact, he reminded anyone with big dreams to take comfort that "the year Joe DiMaggio held the record for most home runs was the same year he had the record for the most strike outs!" One of his greatest joys was working alongside his beloved son Michael, ending the day by seeing his grandkids in recitals, sports games, horse shows or simply having a family meal together. When he wasn't with his family or friends, Gilbert enjoyed going to the theater three to four times a week with friends including his oldest bar mitzvah friend, or even alone. Always interested in world affairs, music, theater and the arts, Gilbert was also an avid skier and tennis player, hobbies he enjoyed with his children and grandchildren, making sure to wear his favorite Cornell, Colgate or Washington and Lee swag. Throughout his life, Gilbert consistently supported his beloved alma mater, Cornell University, the United Jewish Appeal Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York, American Friends of the Hebrew University, the Jewish Communal Fund, and New York University Hospital. Very proud of his Maritime class of 1947, he also supported The Maritime Museum. A philanthropic and generous man to causes, friends and family, and patriarch until the end, Gilbert passed on November 25th, 2020 at the age of 93 peacefully in his home, surrounded with love. He is survived by his son, Michael and his wife, Norma; his daughter, Ariel and her husband, Bob; and his four grandchildren Jennifer, Amy, Aden and Maya. Oh, what a wonderful life!

With these two degrees under his belt and his infamous grit and tenacity, Gilbert returned to New York City where he established a private law practice over the next 50 years and went on to build a highly regarded and successful real estate career. Gil was widely respected in the business world as a man of integrity, distinguished associate, esteemed colleague, mentor, and loyal and devoted friend, but to his family, he was larger than life. A bull in a china shop kind of guy, Gilbert poured his infamous grit and tenacity into loving his family. As the patriarch, he was deeply committed to their education, always mentoring and encouraging them to be their best selves. He was always sure to remind them that life has its challenges, and "pencils have erasers because people make mistakes!" In fact, he reminded anyone with big dreams to take comfort that "the year Joe DiMaggio held the record for most home runs was the same year he had the record for the most strike outs!" One of his greatest joys was working alongside his beloved son Michael, ending the day by seeing his grandkids in recitals, sports games, horse shows or simply having a family meal together. When he wasn't with his family or friends, Gilbert enjoyed going to the theater three to four times a week with friends including his oldest bar mitzvah friend, or even alone. Always interested in world affairs, music, theater and the arts, Gilbert was also an avid skier and tennis player, hobbies he enjoyed with his children and grandchildren, making sure to wear his favorite Cornell, Colgate or Washington and Lee swag. Throughout his life, Gilbert consistently supported his beloved alma mater, Cornell University, the United Jewish Appeal Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York, American Friends of the Hebrew University, the Jewish Communal Fund, and New York University Hospital. Very proud of his Maritime class of 1947, he also supported The Maritime Museum. A philanthropic and generous man to causes, friends and family, and patriarch until the end, Gilbert passed on November 25th, 2020 at the age of 93 peacefully in his home, surrounded with love. He is survived by his son, Michael and his wife, Norma; his daughter, Ariel and her husband, Bob; and his four grandchildren Jennifer, Amy, Aden and Maya. Oh, what a wonderful life!

Omejor te voy a llamar Pablito porque biologicamente hasta podrias ser mi hijo. Hace no mucho tiempo te envie una misiva dandote la enhorabuena por tu intervencion el dia de la mocion de censura, en el que hiciste _mutis por el foro_ a tus amigos de Vox.
 Pues tengo que comentarte, respecto a tus compañeros de pupitre de Navarra, que desde ese dia se miran cada mañana al espejo para ver si siguen con la misma cara que se les quedo al oir tus palabras de la mocion de censura, porque ellos estaban muy comodos en compañia de Vox, y les has hecho un pan como unas ostias. Mucho tendran que acicalarse para que se les cambie.
 Tambien te dije que la gente te iba a mirar con el telescopio para ver si sigues en las mismas de ese dia, o mas bien eres el de antes, y te puse tres retos que resolverian el dilema. El primero los presupuestos. Esperaba que lucharas hasta el final por tus presupuestos, incluida la bajada de impuestos que ya lo has hecho realidad en lo que compete a la Comunidad de Madrid, sin hacer mucha reverencia a las partidas de la sanidad y educacion porque prefieres a tus amigos de las compañias privadas para que lo gestionen, y de paso a ver si puede caer alguna comision, porque el que tuvo retuvo, me refiero a tu partido.
 Pero mira por donde que tu trasero no ha llegado a rozar el asiento de las negociaciones, porque ha sido oir la palabra Bildu y huir de las conversaciones como alma que lleva al diablo, olvidando que hace ya una decada que han pasado a la historia los años de plomo, al igual que los de la guerra civil. Es hora de dejar atras los vilipendios del pasado, como hemos hecho los democratas de verdad con el golpe fascista. Lo has utilizado como excusa para marcar territorio, para atrincherarte en compañia de los que temes que te llamen derechita cobarde otra vez, porque solo sentarte a la mesa es cruzar los limites, es alta traicion, cuando hace años proclamasteis vuestra disposicion a recibirlos en el hemiciclo, como uno mas, si dejaban las armas.
 Pablito, la politica de mirar el retrovisor no conduce mas que a la derrota, y si no, preguntale al rubio con cara de zanahoria a que le ha llevado defender la Norteamerica de las pistolas y el sombrero vaquero. Es cierto que ha obtenido muchos votos, pero no los suficientes. Su estrella de vencedor, ahora que ha caido, apagara el resplandor que deslumbraba a muchos de sus votantes. Mejor no mires en esa direccion, es un horizonte equivocado, y te lo dice alguien que siempre te ha querido aconsejar bien, pero tu tambien has empezado con mal pie tu remontada al caerte del caballo de los presupuestos con tretas de perdedor.
 Y ahora te observo atentamente como vas a abordar las negociaciones de la renovacion del CGPJ, tu segunda premisa, para que tu cambio de imagen sea creible. Hasta el momento lo unico que has hecho es marear la perdiz, y el Gobierno ya te ha dado el plazo de un mes para llegar a un acuerdo. Mucho me temo que sigas con tu rutina de poner trabas, porque con eso no tienes mucho que pensar. Tengo la impresion de que quieres atar bien los machos de la Sala Segunda del Tribunal Supremo, esa que puede ser benevola con las fechorias de tus honorables camaradas, y que el Sr. Lesmes siga haciendo nombramientos, ya va la tercera tanda, en uno de los mayores magnicidios contra la democracia.
 Igual tienes la suerte de que te haga la cama el propio Gobierno, por obra y gracia de su Narciso, que presione por un organo de los jueces elegido por quien ostente la mayoria parlamentaria, dando al traste con la independencia judicial, muy del gusto de quien todavia sigue exhalando autoritarismo desde posiciones de izquierda. Espero, Sr. Sanchez, que no caiga en esa trampa y sea mas listo de lo que se cree el pequeño Aznar (del cual nos tomaremos tiempo de hablar) al llamarle tonto del bote por sus alianzas, y se ponga a los mandos del volante, dejando los criterios de los nombramientos como estan, los 3/5 de ambas camaras, y, eso si, poniendo coto a las atribuciones del CGPJ caducado a la hora de hacer nombramientos. En otro caso, tendre que darle la razon al Sr. Aznar mal que me pese.
 Es mejor no presionar a Casado con las pretensiones del vicepresidente, porque eso seria columpiarse con el Estado de derecho, obtendria los anatemas de Bruselas, pondria en peligro los fondos economicos y seria darle muchisima municion al jefe de la oposicion, cosa que ya hizo en un episodio precedente. Espero, Sr. Sanchez, que no vuelva a tropezar en la misma piedra y busque otras formas de presionar.
 Y vuelvo contigo Pablito, porque resulta obligado aclarar el embrollo de la Comunidad de Madrid. Resulta que esta comunidad es la excepcion que confirma la regla en todo el mundo, y nadie se lo explica. Mientras todo el planeta cierra bares y restaurantes, ademas del toque de queda y el confinamiento perimetral, cuando no el total, como forma de parar el ascenso de contagios, Madrid se las pinta sola para mantener los bares y restaurantes abiertos y el confinamiento perimetral solo los fines de semana, y conseguir un descenso de los contagios. Ha sido como un visto y no visto, como si Ayuso se hubiera sacado un conejo de la chistera. Su curriculum vitae, lleno de dislates, no da como para pensar que dispone de una varita magica que todo lo cura, y menos que su ciencia infusa pueda con todos los epidemiologos del mundo, a no ser que este tocada con la suerte del que le toca la loteria o acierta en las quinielas. Pueden ser los dichosos antigenos, la varita magica que utiliza Ayuso porque no detecta los positivos asintomaticos, los que camuflen la realidad de los contagios en Madrid. El tiempo, que todo lo descubre, nos lo dira.
 Tu trasero no ha llegado a rozar el asiento de las negociaciones,
 porque ha sido oir la palabra Bildu y huir de las conversaciones como alma que lleva el diablo
 Pueden ser los dichosos antigenos, la varita magica que utiliza Ayuso porque no detecta los positivos asintomaticos, los que camuflen la realidad de los contagios en Madrid

There are times during this interview when Brogan, amicable and relaxed and no doubt still plenty good enough to play in many county forward lines even at 36, waxes lyrical about brands, marketing and all that jazz, where work and sponsorship, which he now makes a career out of, weave into the narrative. He loves his lines of business, the companies he helped set up, Legacy and Pep Talk; he likes the energy, the idea of working with a young and vibrant group, having started out as an accountant. But it is when he is talking about those final days with Dublin that his warrior instinct comes to the fore and he displays a more visceral side, demonstrating what football meant to him and why.

What makes this retro-chic so bitterly ironic and profoundly counter- productive, is that the Ranilist UNP heritage they find inescapable is one that has been rejected far more totally than has that of any other government in sri Lanka’s history. The Opposition and therefore democracy itself survive in Sri Lanka simply because Sajith Premadasa and today’s SJB members jumped into a lifeboat in the nick of time and rowed some distance from the UNP before it electorally exploded when the citizens’ vote-torpedo struck it, destroying everyone and everything on-board.

Betsy L. Immel      Our family is so saddened by the loss of a daughter, sister, aunt and niece. Betsy passed peacefully, after a brief battle with coronavirus. She will now live in the eternal peace with her sight and hearing restored. She will be greeted with open arms by the Lord, our Savior. Betsy will be forever remembered for the inspiration she was to all. She conquered life from an early age, with no concern for her obstacles. She was independent, happy and always determined to forge ahead. Betsy was happily married and preceded in death by her husband, Duane whom was also blind. Together, they ran a successful café at the Canton Courthouse which was a popular breakfast and lunch spot for many of the area lawyers and judges.      She was also preceded in death by her father, Tom A. Taylor and grandparents on both sides. She is survived by her mother, Mona "Nancy" Sheldon; her twin sister, Becky (Rich) Barnhart; brother, Steve (Yolanda) Taylor and sister, Teresa "Tess" (Phil) Zepp. Betsy is also survived by special aunts, nieces, nephews and cousins, too many to name. She will be greatly missed by all who knew and loved her.      Due to the difficult times, a celebration of life will be planned at a later date in 2021. Any donations can be made in her name to the Philomatheon Society for the Blind.      Reed, 330-477-6721

 ##  Dave Aland
 Since I’ve been dragged, kicking and screaming, into the ranks of the elderly, losing old friends has become a frequent occurrence. Often I feel regret over never having told someone I missed them, was proud of them, loved them! It’s a sad realization to have missed the chance to reach out to an old friend.
 Seeing Dave Aland’s name in Other Voices recently was a stark reminder of how much Dave and his wife, Hilda, meant to our family (The Capital, Nov. 23).
 In 1967, our Marine Corps family moved to Annapolis with seven kids. We needed to find a place quickly so we settled on a house too small, but was all we could afford or find. I think the neighbors feared the worst, but we were quickly accepted. Our next-door neighbor welcomed us from the first day. He came to our door with a veritable Happy Hour selection of beverages. It was Dave Aland!
 Dave’s welcome made our new space a place of friendship and safety as we faced my husband’s deployment to Vietnam the next year.
 I’m betting there are few people still living in Annapolis who remember Dave ran for Congress! His opponent was a prominent Republican, famous throughout the whole country. I couldn’t believe Dave would dare challenge a man who held such power! At 6 feet, 7 inches, Rogers Clark Ballard Morton, was the tallest man in Congress, as well as one of the most powerful. One couldn’t avoid the comparison of David and Goliath.
 Students of history know Dave didn’t become our representative in the House, but he won in ways even he may not be aware. It’s a given he was a hero to his four boys. He inspired me.

One win doesn't undo months of underwhelming displays, though, the management will also know that.
 This cannot be a false dawn like the Barnsley game, a 3-0 win which was followed by more dire displays.
 it must represent a turning point in this season.
 This squad, on paper, is comfortably top-six. Some might even think it to be a top-two squad, but they have not shown themselves to be promotion candidates up until this point.
 But, if those silly errors continue to be eradicated and this attacking intent, full of verve and with a clear direction, can be replicated consistently, then there is no reason the Bluebirds cannot turn this poor start around.

BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — A Hungarian ministerial commissioner has come under fire for an article comparing American-Hungarian billionaire and philanthropist George Soros, a staunch critic of Hungary’s government, to Adolf Hitler and the Nazis. “Europe is George Soros’ gas chamber,” Szilard Demeter, ministerial commissioner and head of the Petofi Literary Museum in Budapest, wrote in an opinion article Saturday in the pro-government outlet Origo. “Poison gas flows from the capsule of a multicultural open society, which is deadly to the European way of life.” The comments drew outrage from Hungary’s Jewish community, including the Unified Hungarian Jewish Congregation, which called the article “tasteless” and “unforgivable.” “(The article) is a textbook case of the relativization of the Holocaust, and is therefore incompatible with the government’s claim of zero tolerance for anti- Semitism,” the group wrote in a statement. In the article, Demeter, appointed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban to oversee cultural production, compared Soros to Adolph Hitler, writing he was “the liberal Führer, and his liber-aryan army deifies him more than did Hitler’s own.” Soros, who was born in Hungary and is a Holocaust survivor, is a frequent target of Orban’s government for his philanthropic activities that favor liberal causes. Government media campaigns targeting Soros have led to charges of anti- Semitism. The article addressed a conflict over the European Union’s next budget, which member states Hungary and Poland are blocking over provisions that could block payments to countries that do not uphold democratic standards. Demeter referred to the two countries, both of which are under EU investigation for undermining judicial...

 The $50 payment to deer hunters appears to be illegal and it also is not an effective way to provide food for the needy and to reduce deer populations. Hunters take most deer harvested in Anne Arundel County by bow hunting and most of that season has ended.
