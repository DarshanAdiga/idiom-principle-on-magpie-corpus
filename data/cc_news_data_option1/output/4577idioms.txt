PLYMOUTH -- Benjamin Franklin once said that there only two certainties in this world: death and taxes. Now, it seems the former is going to cost more.
 The town is reviewing rates for burial and cremation, and may increase them soon. Proposed hikes could see the price of a cemetery plot jump from $800 to $1,200 while cremation fees could go from $250 to $300.
 And if the deceased weighs in excess of 400 pounds, it could cost an additional $500 to be cremated.
 In a memo to Town Manager Melissa Arrighi, Cemetery and Crematory Superintendent Ken King is endorsing fee increases in several areas for his department. A survey of other related facilities and services in the area shows Plymouth is not keeping up with the going rates for taking care of those who have departed this plane of existence.
 "My recommendation (is) to raise most rates in the cemetery and crematory as this has not been done since September of 2014," the memo read. "The proposed rates are more in line with other towns and private cemeteries."
 Other recommended fee changes include raising the cost of full burials from $675 to $1,000 on weekdays and $925 to $1,300 on weekends, per-day holding fee from $100 to $200, and the setting of foundation markers from $100 to $200.
 In addition, King is proposing limiting sales of burial plots to two per resident and eliminating them altogether for nonresidents. The town's cemeteries, including Vine Hills, near the center of Plymouth, are running out of space. Currently, the town has an inventory of about 300 remaining plots. It sells about 80 per year.
 "If we do nothing regarding space, we face a critical shortage in about two years at which point pre-need purchases would not be allowed and purchases would only be made once someone has passed," Arrighi wrote in her report to the Select Board.
 Plans are in the works to dig up more space for burial plots in town, which is required by state law to provide "suitable places for the interment of persons dying within its limits."
 The Plymouth Select Board plans to review the rate increases and expansion plans.

2.2.2 Influence of COVID-19 Outbreak on Paper Packaging Industry Development


--DocBreak--
WASHINGTON — U.S. health officials have allowed emergency use of the first antibody drug to help the immune system fight COVID-19, an experimental approach against the virus that has killed more than 238,000 Americans.
 The Food and Drug Administration on Monday cleared the experimental drug from Eli Lilly for people 12 and older with mild or moderate COVID-19 not requiring hospitalization. It's a one-time treatment given through an IV.
 The therapy is still undergoing additional testing to establish its safety and effectiveness. It is similar to a treatment President Donald Trump received after contracting the virus last month.
 Lilly's studies of the antibody drug are continuing. Early results suggest it may help clear the coronavirus sooner and possibly cut hospitalizations in people with mild to moderate COVID-19. A study of it in hospitalized patients was stopped when independent monitors saw the drug did not seem to be helping in that situation.
 The government previously reached an agreement to buy and supply much of the early production of Lilly's drug.
 One other treatment has an emergency use designation now — convalescent plasma, or the blood of COVID-19 survivors. No large studies have shown it to be more effective than usual care alone, however.
 The new drug is part of an emerging family of biologic therapies that offer a promising new approach to preventing serious disease and death from COVID-19. Experts say the infused drugs could serve as a therapeutic bridge to help manage the virus until vaccines are widely available.

Chicago White Sox manager Tony La Russa has been charged with driving under the influence.
 According to the Maricopa County Justice Courts website, the arrest occurred in February, but charges were filed on Oct. 28, one day before La Russa's hiring was announced by the White Sox. There is no attorney listed for La Russa on the website.
 White Sox spokesman Scott Reifert said the team was aware of the arrest when the 76-year-old La Russa was hired.
 "Because this is an active case, we cannot comment further at this time," Reifert said Monday night in an email.
 La Russa pleaded guilty to driving under the influence in Florida in 2007 after police found him asleep inside his running sport utility vehicle at a stop light and smelling of alcohol.

JEFFERSONVILLE — Southern Indiana-based attorney Steve Voelker was just 21 when he enlisted to serve in the Vietnam War, in advance of the likelihood of being drafted. The six years he served are — for better or worse — a part of his life that will always stick with him. But, it’s a decision he’d make again.
 Voelker had been in college in Arizona when he answered the call. He knew he was going to have to take a semester out of school to earn money to continue, and he knew that if he was out of school he would be drafted. It was this, along with growing up with stories from his parents of World War II, that sealed the deal on his decision.

 # White Sox manager Tony La Russa charged with DUI stemming from February arrest
 Bob Nightengale
 USA TODAY
 New Chicago White Sox manager Tony La Russa was charged with driving under the influence in February in Phoenix, according to court records obtained by ESPN, which the White Sox were aware when they hired him less than two weeks ago.
 “I can confirm we were aware,’’ White Sox spokesman Scott Reifert said. “Because this is an active case, we cannot comment further at this time.’’
 A high-ranking White Sox official told USA TODAY Sports that La Russa is no danger of losing his job, or any discipline by the club.
 It’s the second known drunken driving arrest for La Russa, 76, who plead guilty in 2007 to a misdemeanor DUI in Jupiter, Fla., while managing the St. Louis Cardinals.
 La Russa was pulled over on Feb. 24 when his SUV hit a curb near the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. He was taken into custody after failing a field sobriety test, but refused to submit to a breath, blood or urine test, according to an affidavit filed with the Arizona Department of Public Safety.
 The case was filed on Oct. 28, one day before La Russa was announced as manager of the White Sox.
 La Russa, who lives in Phoenix part-time and in Danville, Calif., was cited for driving under the influence and registering a blood-alcohol content of .08 or more. If convicted, La Russa could face up to 10 days in jail.
 In March of 2007 during spring training, La Russa was arrested on a drunken driving charge after police said they found him asleep inside his vehicle at a stop light in Jupiter, Florida.
 "(The) situation is the opposite of feeling good," La Russa said at the time. "It was an embarrassment, so I apologize to anyone who is close to me, members of the Cardinals organization, our fans. I regret it, take responsibility and I'm not sure there is anything else I can say."

While Joe Biden is prepared to sacrifice traditional American jobs on the altar of green energy (despite it being far from certain that the “millions” of jobs promised in the fight against climate change will ever materialize), President Trump has prioritized American workers in all sectors—in particular the energy sector which has been under attack for decades now. Before he took office, Hillary Clinton famously sabotaged her prospects in 2016 by promising to put coal miners out of business. President Trump kept his promise to keep them in business. He also understood that appealing to blue-collar workers was not just an economic draw: it was cultural.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Despite President-elect Joe Biden’s victory, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday President Donald Trump is “100% within his rights” to question election results, as GOP lawmakers fall in line behind the White House.The Republican leader’s remarks, his first public comments since Biden was declared the winner of the presidential election, show how reluctant Trump’s allies on Capitol Hill have been to defy the president, even in his defeat.Most Republicans are refusing to congratulate Biden or declining to push Trump to accept the outcome, even though there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud.“Our institutions are actually built for this,” McConnell said as he opened the Senate. “We have the system in place to consider concerns and President Trump is 100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options.”McConnell said the process will play out and “reach its conclusion.”Republicans are closing the Trump era much the way they started it, by joining the president in shattering civic norms and sowing uncertainty in institutions, now in a way that threatens the nation’s normal transition of power.Privately, Republicans on Capitol Hill say they are in a tough spot, wary of crossing Trump and his most ardent supporters. But their actions are casting doubt on the durability of the nation’s elections system and impeding Biden’s new administration. The head of the General Services Administration under Trump has held off on formally beginning the Biden transition to the White House.Trump has declined to concede the presidential race and is mounting legal fights in several states, but there has been no indication or evidence of voter irregularities or widespread fraud in the election.The president’s refusal to accept the results means the election disputes could drag for weeks as states certify their tallies or push to mid-December, when the Electoral College is set to vote.Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he would encourage the president “not to concede.”With the Senate majority on the line, Republicans don’t dare risk alienating Trump or his supporters ahead of Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration.In Georgia, where Trump is teetering, both Republican senators are being forced into a Jan. 5 runoff that will determine party control. Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler jointly called the their state’s election system an “embarrassment.”Many Republicans have signaled a December deadline, pointing to the time it took to resolve the disputed 2000 race before Democrat Al Gore conceded to Republican George W. Bush.McConnell spoke shortly after meeting with Attorney General William Barr at the Capitol. Barr has authorized federal prosecutors across the U.S. to pursue “substantial allegations” of voting irregularities, according to a memo to U.S. attorneys obtained by The Associated Press.“In the end, we want all legal ballots to be counted,” the No. 2 House Republican, Steve Scalise, told AP. “You go back to Bush v. Gore, it was second week of December that it got resolved ... so there’s still questions out there that need to get resolved and that process is playing itself out.”Unlike the 2000 election, when a few hundred votes in Florida separated Bush and Gore, Trump is casting a wide net of legal challenges in states where Biden is thousands of votes ahead of him.Some Republicans scoff at the president’s legal team, helmed by personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, and doubt the president has a credible route to challenge the election results. Election officials from both political parties have publicly stated the election went well.Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Monday the Republicans' refusal to stand by the election results is “extremely dangerous, extremely poisonous to our democracy.”Schumer said election lawsuits can be valid but they must be based in evidence and facts. He dismissed Trump’s challenges as “frivolous.”“Joe Biden won the election fair and square,” Schumer said.McConnell and Republicans said Monday they don’t want the “media” to declare the outcome of the election.But actually, the results in the presidential election are being determined much they way they are in all elections — including those for the House and Senate that are not being questioned — based on an analysis of vote tallies.McConnell touted the results Monday of the congressional races — GOP senators brushed back Democratic challengers and House Republicans expanded their ranks — even as he raised questions about the presidential contest.“Let’s not have any lectures, no lectures, about how the president should immediately, cheerfully accept preliminary election results,” McConnell said.Pressed if there was any evidence of voter fraud, GOP Sen. John Cornyn, who just won reelection in Texas, demurred.“That’s really not my, my role,” Cornyn told reporters on Capitol Hill. “There is a process that is available, and I don’t begrudge the president for availing himself of that process — but in the end, they’re going to have to come up with some facts and evidence.”Privately, Republicans on Capitol Hill have said they are trying to give Trump the time and space he needs to come to grips with the election results.“Well, I think he’s got a right, a constitutional right, if there are legal challenges they want to make,” said Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Republican. “Let those play out.”Republican lawmakers are hesitant to push Trump to concede to Biden, knowing it would anger their base of Trump’s most devoted supporters. But the Republican lawmakers are not overtly encouraging the president’s claims of fraud, even as they allow questions to linger.Only a handful of Republicans, including Sens. Susan Collins, Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski, have congratulated Biden on the election.“Stay out of the fray,” as one Republican aide put it. The aide and other Republicans were granted anonymity to frankly discuss the situation.Whatever the position, “you’re going to anger half the country,” said another Republican on Capitol Hill.At the same time, Republicans are feeling increasingly unmoored from the White House. Trump himself has not been returning some senators' phone calls, one of the aides said.Scalise said he spoke to Trump a few days ago and said the president “left it all on the field” in the campaign.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

“Someone said the guidance seems ‘as clear as mud,’” Paul said. “I’ve read it a few times and I’m sort of agreeing with that.”
 Part of the ambiguity is around the footnotes indicating counties should consider the case rates and metrics of neighboring counties when opening, particularly if the school districts have a lot of residents traveling in for work or school.
 This means Columbia County districts would have to factor in the case rates in Multnomah and Washington counties. Multnomah was added to the state watch list in October because of its rise in cases that were not linked to confirmed cases, indicating a high rate of spread.
 On Friday Gov. Kate Brown announced a two-week pause on social activities in certain counties to try and curb the rapid community spread. Multnomah is one of the effected counties, and Washington is close to the threshold. The pause effects the allowable capacities in restaurants and activity centers, like gyms and museums, and asks that individuals limit their social gatherings.
 “We are seeing in real time how this virus can quickly snowball out of control,” Brown said in a release about the pause. “This two-week pause is a series of measures and recommendations intended to curb human contact— both through reducing the amount of people we interact with, and the frequency of those encounters. We must stop this virus from spreading.”
 To ensure that children can go back to school, and stay in school, Paul said it was important for everybody to follow health recommendations by wearing facial coverings, keeping physical distance, washing their hands and modify holiday behaviors.

As we mentioned on our last call, in July, we launched our One For the Roadies campaign in partnership with Crew Nation to benefit out of work touring and venue workers. After securing 37 music artists to customize 42 of our Roadie 24 coolers for our online auction, the program raised $135,000. The campaign was an incredible success and attracted interest from additional top-tier artists who were eager to support future efforts. We've also focused on finding ways to ensure the wild is open, welcoming, and accessible to all. We continue to support our relationships with both Thrive Outside and Big City Mountaineers, two organizations committed to driving diversity in the outdoors. We also launched a new partnership with Black Outside, an incredible organization based out of San Antonio, Texas, which connects black youth to the outdoors.

WHEN an accused is charged to court he can apply to be released on bail. This is sometimes referred to as bail pending trial. At this stage an accused has been charged to a trial court for specific criminal acts. An accused is at this stage presumed to be innocent in compliance with S.36 (5) 1999 constitution as amended Adamu Muri Vs COP IGP 1957 NNLR. Bail at this stage is a basic right Paul Ochedo vs The State 1981 BNSLR 5. Section 36 (5) of the amended constitution reads: “Every person who is charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed to be innocent until he is proved guilty.” This presumption of innocence in favour of an accused works in his favour while considering his application for bail. As an accused is presumed to be innocent he should therefore be released on bail pending the determination of his case.

Check Point Research, the Threat Intelligence arm of Check Point Software Technologies Ltd., a renowned provider of cyber security solutions globally, has published its latest Global Threat Index for October 2020. Researchers reported that the Trickbot and Emotet trojans continue to rank as the top two most prevalent malware in October, and that the trojans have been responsible for the sharp increase in ransomware attacks against hospitals and healthcare providers globally. File-encrypting ransomware The FBI and other U.S. government agencies recently issued a warning about ransomware attacks targeting the healthcare sector, warning that the estimated one million-plus Trickbot infections worldwide are being used to download and spread file-encrypting ransomware such as Ryuk. Ryuk is also distributed via the Emotet trojan, which remains in 1st place in the Top Malware Index for the fourth month in succession. Ransomware attacks against healthcare organisations and hospitals in October increased by 36% in EMEA Check Point threat intelligence data showed that the healthcare sector was the most targeted by ransomware in the U.S. in October, with attacks increasing by 71% compared with September 2020. Similarly, ransomware attacks against healthcare organisations and hospitals in October increased by 36% in EMEA and 33% in APAC. Support remote workforces "We've seen ransomware attacks increasing since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, to try and take advantage of security gaps as organisations scrambled to support remote workforces. These have surged alarmingly over the past three months, especially against the healthcare sector, and are driven by pre-existing TrickBot and Emotet infections." "We strongly urge healthcare organisations everywhere to be extra vigilant about this risk, and scan for these infections before they can cause real damage by being the gateway to a ransomware attack," said Maya Horowitz, Director, Threat Intelligence & Research, Products at Check Point. Top malware families This month, Emotet remains the most popular malware with a global impact of 12% of organisations The research team also warns that "MVPower DVR Remote Code Execution" is the most common exploited vulnerability, impacting 43% of organisations globally, followed by "Dasan GPON Router Authentication Bypass" and "HTTP Headers Remote Code Execution (CVE-2020-13756)" with both impacting 42% of organisations globally. (The arrows relate to the change in rank compared to the previous month.) This month, Emotet remains the most popular malware with a global impact of 12% of organisations, followed by Trickbot and Hiddad which both impacted 4% of organisations worldwide. ↔ Emotet - Emotet is an advanced self-propagating, and modular trojan. Emotet was once used as a banking trojan, and recently has been used as a distributer of other malware or malicious campaigns. It uses multiple methods for maintaining persistence and evasion techniques to avoid detection. In addition, it can be spread through phishing spam emails containing malicious attachments or links. ↔ Trickbot - Trickbot is a dominant banking trojan constantly being updated with new capabilities, features and distribution vectors. This enables Trickbot to be a flexible and customisable malware that can be distributed as part of multi purposed campaigns. ↑ Hiddad - Hiddad is an Android malware which repackages legitimate apps and then releases them to a third-party store. Its main function is to display ads, but it can also gain access to key security details built into the OS.  Top exploited vulnerabilities This month "MVPower DVR Remote Code Execution" is the most common exploited vulnerability, impacting 43% of organisations globally, followed by "Dasan GPON Router Authentication Bypass" and "HTTP Headers Remote Code Execution (CVE-2020-13756)" with both impacting 42% of organisations globally. ↔ MVPower DVR Remote Code Execution - Remote code execution vulnerability exists in MVPower DVR devices. A remote attacker can exploit this weakness to execute arbitrary code in the affected router via a crafted request. ↔ Dasan GPON Router Authentication Bypass (CVE-2018-10561) - An authentication bypass vulnerability that exists in Dasan GPON routers. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information and gain unauthorised access into the affected system. ↑ HTTP Headers Remote Code Execution (CVE-2020-13756) - HTTP headers let the client and the server pass additional information with an HTTP request. A remote attacker may use a vulnerable HTTP Header to run arbitrary code on the victim machine. Top mobile malwares This month Hiddad is the most prevalent Mobile malware, followed by xHelper and Lotoor. Hiddad - Hiddad is an Android malware which repackages legitimate apps and then releases them to a third-party store. Its main function is to display ads, but it can also gain access to key security details built into the OS. xHelper - xHelper is a malicious application seen in the wild since March 2019, used for downloading other malicious apps and display advertisement. The application is capable of hiding itself from the user and reinstalling itself in case it is uninstalled. Lotoor - Lotoor is a hack tool that exploits vulnerabilities on Android operating system in order to gain root privileges on compromised mobile devices.

ELLISTOWN – East Union’s Lady Urchins finally tasted victory Thursday following two disappointing losses to open the 2020-21 basketball season.
 Senior guard Maggie McVey scored a team-high 15 points to lead East Union to a 46-34 win against Blue Mountain. In the boys game, the Urchins also won their first game with a 41-37 decision against the visitors.
 The Lady Urchins opened the season with back-to-back losses to Shannon and Ingomar. They lost to Ingomar on a last-second shot.
 “I want to play games like this to get them prepared for district play,” East Union coach Chase Brown said of his team’s tough early schedule. “Tonight was a good win. We needed it. We’re not young on the court, but we’re inexperienced.”
 East Union charged to a 26-12 halftime lead on the strength of two 3-pointers from guard Abby Patterson and one from guard Peyton Wildman.
 In the third quarter, guard Carrie Wilkinson connected on a 3-pointer and McVey added three field goals to give the Lady Urchins a 35-18 lead.
 Down 17, Blue Mountain made a run in the fourth quarter, but the Lady Urchins held on. Brown was not pleased with his team’s final eight minutes.
 “I’m excited we got the win, but the effort was not there. We’ve got to play four quarters,” he said. “Three quarters were pretty good. The last quarter we’ve got to work on.”
 McVey continued her strong start with the 15-point effort. She scored 17 in the opener against Shannon and 16 against Ingomar.
 “She’s stepping up as a senior; she has to,” he said. “There are still some things – decision-making – she needs to work on. She’s a big factor in what we’re trying to do.”
 Brown was also pleased with the play of his guards, Patterson and Wilkinson. Patterson had eight points and two 3-pointers while Wilkinson had six points and two first-half steals.
 East Union 41, Blue Mountain 37
 Noah Johnson and Gavin Hall scored 13 points each to lead the Urchins to their first win. Johnson’s late layup on an assist from point guard Jude Treadaway made the difference.
 “I’m proud of the effort. We’re a little short-handed right now, but it feels good to get a win,” East Union coach Tim McDonald said. “Blue Mountain pressured us all night long. That was really good for us. Our ball-handlers are young and don’t have a lot of experience.”
 Treadaway and Jace Basil added seven points apiece for the Urchins. Jaden Hall led Blue Mountain with 20 points.
