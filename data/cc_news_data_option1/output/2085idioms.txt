ROME: Italy's Serie A can resume on Jun 20 after a three-month absence in a country hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, sports Minister Vincenzo Spadafora said on Thursday (May 28).


  "The Technical and Scientific Committee gave its agreement on the protocol and the federation assured me that it had a Plan B and a Plan C," Spadafora said after a video conference meeting with Italian football chiefs.

Just so you're not thinking that this is about to be another huge, long- running series that would drive the idea of the Genie into the ground, Mark Langshaw of We Got This Covered helps to keep the story grounded by stating that Disney is interested in creating a limited series starring Will Smith in the role that many feel that he might have nailed in the live action version of Aladdin. In all fairness, Smith had a long way to go to impress people when it came to his version of the Genie, since Robin Williams was still the favored voice of the big blue magical being and a lot of people wouldn't go so far as to equate Smith with William, ever. But in reality Smith did a fairly good job and even more, his character and the fact that it was live action went a long way towards indicating that the Genie would have a long and full life with his family following the movie, so it's easy to think that Disney saw potential with this idea and surmised that they could find a way to work it into their schedule. When it will happen is anyone's guess, but the idea is to develop a prequel first to show the Genie before he met Aladdin, while a sequel is indeed being discussed and could possibly revive elements from The Return of Jafar and the third Aladdin movie, King of Thieves, as there's plenty of material there still to be used and adapted to live action.

We hope this letter finds you and your loved ones safe, well and managing the best as can be expected in this crazy and difficult time. One important benefit of having been in the investment business now for 100 years is that it can provide useful perspective when a crisis strikes and markets run amok. As we write, while there is some light at the end of the tunnel, COVID-19 continues to wreak havoc on world health, our global economy, and our capital markets. The bull market that we have enjoyed over the last 10 plus years, characterized in part by rather reassuringly tepid market volatility, came to an end in mid-March, as large portions of the global economy shut down, corporate earnings rapidly retreated, unemployment spiked, and virtually all major market indexes collapsed into bear market territory, declining by more than 20%. Coming on the heels of last year's extraordinary equity market performance, this abrupt and sharp downturn was and is, understandably, deeply unsettling for investors. We have mentioned in our past letters that highly valued markets can sometimes fall victim to "black swan" events that were entirely unforeseeable. This time around, that dark bird came in the form of a virus that quickly developed into a pandemic.

For many, if not most, Wilmington retailers, May was their first time open in more than a month after being temporarily shuttered due to the coronavirus pandemic.


   


  Mayfaire Town Center reopened May 9, although at least one of its stores, Pier 1 Imports, will soon be closing all of its stores nationwide. Pier 1 also has a location at Hanover Center.


   


  Independence Mall reopened May 12. At the mall, J.C. Penney -- which will close about a third of its stores in the U.S. after declaring bankruptcy earlier this month -- reopened May 20 and is offering "contactless checkout," "contact-free curbside pickup" and extended return policies as a way of enticing shoppers perhaps spooked by the prospects of contracting COVID-19.


   


  In downtown Wilmington, Modern Legend, a record, clothing and gift shop owned by Catherine Hawksworth, reopened May 15.


   


  "I was really anxious and nervous, because I want to do the right thing," she said, which is why she didn't open earlier.


   


  As it turned out, she was pleasantly surprised.


   


  Her first weekend open "was really busy," she said, and not only that, people were following the list of rules she has by her Front Street shop's entrance (sanitize hands before entering, stay 6 feet away from staff and other customers).


   


  "I was shocked at how responsible and respectful people were being," Hawksworth said.


   


  Area grocery stores, of course, have been open throughout the pandemic. At the Piggly Wiggly in Leland, which was closing early for a while but recently extended its hours back to 9 p.m., "It's been a little hectic," said assistant manager Keith Bullock. "I am ready for the norm to return."


   


  Products like rice, paper towels and, of course, toilet paper "have been hard to come by," he said, while beef and pork prices have gone up -- "if you can get it," he said.


   


  The store recently ordered 10 cases of beef and pork "and got zero," he said.


   


  Piggly Wiggly isn't requiring masks for its workers or customers, Bullock said, though they are made available to both.


   


  At the community-owned Tidal Creek Food Co-Op in Wilmington, "We've erred on the side of caution," said General Manager Anthony Garguilo.


   


  They might be the only area food store with an outdoor hand-washing station, he said, and "staff has been wearing masks and gloves since day one."


   


  Like the retail giant CostCo, Tidal Creek started requiring customers to wear masks about two weeks ago.


   


  Meats and chicken "have been in short supply," Garguilo said, but there's been a "tremendous increase in interest in the local stuff. We can't keep it in stock."


   


  They'll get 100 dozen local eggs in, he said, and sell out of them over the weekend. He doesn't see things returning to normal anytime soon.


   


  "We are going to budget out next year based on this new reality," Garguilo said. "We're anticipating it to continue indefinitely."


   


  For Lisa LaRue, owner of the Heart of Carolina gift shop in downtown retail outlet The Cotton Exchange, "It's a scary time," she said.


   


  LaRue is also president of the Cotton Exchange Merchants Association, which is comprised of the outlet's two dozen or so shop owners. About half of them are back open, she said, but "traffic is minimal."


   


  She wears a mask in her shop, but says she worries about handling cash or customer debit cards. Still, she feels like she needs to be open because "this is tourist season," she said.


   


  LaRue said she's applied for small-business grants and loans, but has yet to get one. Hawksworth, owner of Modern Legend, said she's "applied for everything under the sun." She's had to lay off her employees.


   


  "It's just me," she said. "There's no getting back to normal. The goal is to stay afloat."

"We would love to host the 2020 season, as it would be a huge impact for our Island's economy. However, the health and safety of Islanders always comes first. There are many health guidelines and restrictions that need to be reviewed and approved by our chief medical health office. Once these are approved, we will put together a package to bid as a host for the CPL."


  The CPL said it had no comment "at this time."


  P.E.I. had been looking to host several HFX Wanderers games prior to the pandemic.


  As of Thursday, P.E.I. had reported 27 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with no deaths The province plans to further relax restrictions on June 1.


  Organized recreational activities and team sports will be allowed although modifications will be required based on the level of physical contact involved.


  The eight-team CPL was scheduled to start its second season on April 11 but postponed the kickoff on March 20, saying it was following Canada Soccer's decision to suspend all sanctioned soccer activities — and COVID-19 directives by governments and health officials banning public gatherings during the global pandemic.


  The suspension of the regular season came one week after the CPL said it was halting pre-season training for all its clubs for 14 days. The league has remained on hiatus since then.

BringMeTheNews.com notes Austin recently led a group that kept the name for Lake Calhoun from getting changed to its original Lakota name.

PORTLAND, Ore. – The Bonneville Power Administration presented Kyle Vopat with one of its highest honors as part of the 2020 Administrator’s Excellence Awards.


  The annual program honors BPA employees and members of the public whose innovation, initiative, superior service or courageous acts have made exceptional contributions to BPA’s mission, the electric utility industry or the local community.


  On a day off from his demanding job as a BPA line worker, Vopat came across an awkwardly parked car on the side of the road in central Idaho. He noticed a man was kneeling beside the vehicle, so he turned around to see if the stranger needed help. When Vopat pulled up next to the car, he found it wasn't a stranger but his friend of 20 years, and the man was having a heart attack. With his advanced first-aid and CPR training, Vopat kept calm and drove his friend to the nearest hospital. In an act of kindness and courage, and with a willingness to help someone he thought was a complete stranger, Vopat ultimately saved his friend's life.

Merritt Gibson was savoring her spring break, a rare chance to get back home and spend some time with her family in Weston. But then the singer-songwriter, like everybody else, had the rest of her plans upended by the quarantine and had to finish her junior year at the University of Virginia online.


  Gibson wanted to mark the sudden shift in everyone's priorities, express her disappointment and frustration at being separated from her normal life and also provide some inspiration for others going through the same thing.


  In an afternoon she penned a song, "Breaking Down," which details the sudden interruption of a love affair, the unexpected separation of two people who are just beginning to know and appreciate each other. But amid all that anguish there is also hope and an optimistic look ahead to better days.


  It's a soothing tune, ultimately, delivered with her warm alto vocals, and an anthem to tell us we will get through these trying times. She had what she felt was a good song, so Gibson made a bare bones demo herself, and then called Grammy-winning producer "Bassy Bob" Brockmann at his New Orleans home.


  That's when the story becomes something we probably could only hear in 2020 as Brockmann loved the tune and devised a way they could turn it into a record with a full band, using the Pro Tools new Source Connect feature, and bringing in musicians from across the country. And just to make it more poignant yet, Brockmann discovered he had coronavirus while he was working on the project, and so it became a real touchstone for him as he battled back to full recovery.


  The new single was released May 11 and a portion of the proceeds will benefit healthcare workers support programs. We caught up with Gibson, 21, last week from her Weston home.


  "This situation we all found ourselves in is so bizarre," said Gibson. "I wrote the song because I wanted it to somehow get across this sense of isolation and loneliness that we all feel. But I also made sure it had these mentions of better times, so it is sort of soothing. I think we all need that right now. It has a calming feel to it and a lot of that comes from the cello we have."


  Gibson has been forging a music career for a few years now. Between her junior and senior years of high school she recorded an album of songs written during her teen years. It didn't come out until the middle of her freshman year in college but "Eyes on Us" shows the young songsmith to be a versatile and compelling performer. The 2018 title cut is reflective folk-pop, while "Ghost Town" is a lovely piano ballad.


  That lilting folk sound reappears on the poppy ballad "Memories," but Gibson starts rocking out on "I Heard," and "My Best Friends" is a breezy rocker with a video that has the singer taking obvious relish in playing an electric guitar. The lyrics reflect young romance and the ups and downs of growing up with a nuanced sense of wonder.


  "I didn't know Bob Brockmann well before this but I had been researching producers for my next project," Gibson explained. "We spoke a couple months ago and so when I wrote and demo'ed this song, after finding out U.Va., was closed, I realized I had time to actually record a full version of it. I wanted the kind of producer who could make this song speak to the way all my feelings went into it. I think the final version is incredible and I'm very happy with it."


  For such a seemingly precocious talent, Gibson came to her musical focus rather late. Early in her junior year of high school at Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn., her music teacher gave her an assignment, to set an Edgar Allen Poe poem to music.


  "I had to play it for parents' weekend and seeing the reaction I got is what steered me in this direction," said Gibson, with a laugh. "I had written a bunch of songs already but never had done anything with them. After that, I started doing demos of my songs, got a manager and began working behind the scenes. It was a years-long process, because I wanted my work to be the best quality, so I basically sat on my first album for a year before we released it. At college my music is a big part of who I am. Everybody knows about it and Charlottesville is a great music scene so when I play the little clubs there my friends come out to hear me."


  Gibson is a history and public policy major, but she hasn't been neglecting her musical journey. Last summer she interned in Nashville for ASCAP, the songwriting royalties organization, and also played in Nashville clubs at night. But before you wonder if the folk, pop and rock songbird might be thinking of going country, she says her latest influence is electronic dance music.


  "I love running through genres, for sure," said Gibson. "My first year at college I was mostly playing the songs I'd recorded in high school and it was fun to revisit them later. But now, I have formed a band at U.Va. and I'd say I'm definitely moving in more of a rock direction. As a solo act, you're not really able to go very far away from the folk-type style, but it has been so much fun to go from that to singing with a rock band. I listen to much more electronic music now. I still write all my songs with acoustic guitar, but I am looking for a more commercial direction too. I just want to continue to evolve with my music.


  "I'm very interested in history and current events but also other aspects like music policy and copyright law," added Gibson of her studies. "I think that will all be helpful for me as a businesswoman. I want to be armed with as much knowledge as possible and know what I'm getting into, not just for myself, but also so I can advocate for expanding artists' rights."

Hi, thank you management for taking my questions and congratulations on the results. So, I have a few, I'll probably ask them one by one. So first is on the accounting adjustment. So I noticed that the release mentioned, there is around a RMB140 million revenue resulting from these accounting change, and then there is RMB1.4 billion cost. So simply put, the difference is the accounting adjustments, and I think it's roughly RMB540 --, I'm sorry RMB580 million. So, and when I add this number to our profit, it seems to be in line with the RMB764 million non-GAAP net profit under you standards.

OTTAWA -- A Canadian court ruling that could permit the extradition of a senior Huawei Technologies Co Ltd executive to the United States leaves Canada vulnerable to further retaliation from Beijing, analysts said.


  Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on Wednesday lost a challenge to a U.S. bid to extradite her to face bank fraud charges, a decision the Chinese embassy in Ottawa strongly denounced.


  For Canada, the stakes are high. After Meng's arrest in Vancouver in December 2018, China detained two Canadian citizens on state security charges and blocked imports of some canola seed. This month, China's CanSino Biologics Inc began working with the country's National Research Council to "pave the way" for future COVID-19 vaccine trials in Canada. China has been supplying the country with personal protection equipment during the outbreak.


  "If China decides to cut us off from those kinds of things, people will die," said Stephanie Carvin, an assistant professor and security expert at Ottawa's Carleton University.


  "My very strong concern is that cooperation goes away very quickly, and it leaves us in a very bad position," she added.


  Guy Saint-Jacques, a former Canadian ambassador to China, forecast Beijing would announce a trial date for the two Canadian citizens it is holding, as well as taking more punitive trade measures.


  Chinese President "Xi Jinping will want to appear strong and will want to be seen as acting against Canada," Saint-Jacques told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.


  Asked on Thursday if he feared Chinese backlash, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau did not answer. Instead, he noted that Canada's judiciary system is independent, and renewed his call for immediate release of citizens Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.


  "We will continue to defend our interests and our values," Trudeau added.


  "There are a lot of issues in play," said Roland Paris, a former foreign policy adviser to Trudeau and professor of international affairs at University of Ottawa.


  Managing relations with China is like "walking the razor's edge," he said.


  "Our approach to China is one that is not naive and… we're not afraid to take a strong line and a firm line when we need to," said a government source in Ottawa, requesting anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.


  University of British Columbia professor Paul Evans predicted the two detainees would remain behind bars for some time.

NORTH EAST — The day after he turned 16 Geronta Harding found out he was alone in the world.


  “My mom said she was leaving,” Harding said. Making the comment that she “couldn’t take this anymore,” Harding said his mother left him, his brother and sister behind and disappeared.


  His sister is now living with an aunt, and the brother was sent a different way but Harding went into state care and is now in treatment foster care through The Arc Northern Chesapeake Region. Now living in North East with his foster family, Harding is getting settled in and taking advantage of what The Arc can offer.


  “I am learning life skills,” he said. That includes job interview, budgeting and how to read receipts. “Lucky for me I am able to adapt quickly.”


  May is National Foster Care Month and a good time to talk about how it works for kids with extra challenges, such as the case with Geronta Harding.


  Patrick Seidl, spokesman for The Arc NCR through The Fallston Group, said Harding has been assigned a caseworker too who works with his foster mother, Brittany Weygand, to help him get ahead in life.


  “That’s one-on-one case management planning with goals to get him where he wants to be in life,” Seidl said.


  For Harding that goal includes video game design and animation. He’s been working on “King Wolf” for quite some time.


  “It’s mysticism and fantasy,” he said of the world he creates on paper and soon on computer. “Drawing with a computer, trying to learn this is hard.”

Cobb County athletic directors Amie Howard, Jeff Hutson and Matt Williams were all honored by the Georgia Athletic Director’s Association as athletic director of the year in their respective regions.


  Howard was honored for the second year in a row in Region 6AAAAAA for her work at Allatoona. Campbell’s Hutson was recognized as the Region 2AAAAAAA winner, and Williams earned the award for Region 3AAAAAAA at North Cobb.


  Though thankful for the honor, the ADs saw the award as more than a personal accomplishment. It is a representation of an entire school and program.


  “Any time these awards are given, I don’t look at it as necessarily what I have done, but more as a reflection of what my coaches have done and how wonderful they are,” Howard said.


  The coaches highlighted the praises from the athletic directors, and how they are seen as the foundation of any program.


  “This award is no more than a reflection of your coaches,” Hutson said. “When they do a good job, it makes it look like you did a good job.”


  Campbell has been hard at work behind Hutson’s leadership throughout the past year. The school's new weight room is a testament to the effort and success around the program, and Hutson sees the new facility as a representation of hard work and determination.


  “We scratched, clawed and saved and were able to get ourselves a first-class weight room,” he said. “It is important to me that the kids have the facilities they need to succeed.”


  Hutson, also an assistant principal, said he emphasizes time management as the key to having a successful program and knows that his student-athletes need an assistant principal first and an athletic director second.


  Likewise, Williams has been in many positions at North Cobb, coaching multiple sports in his 21 years at the school. His experience as a coach has given him a different perspective and helped him garner success in his four years as athletic director.


  Williams said he sees the importance in every role when creating a successful program.


  “I think it is more a reflection of what our school has done,” he said. “North Cobb is the state's best kept secret, and that is because of the people around me.”


  For Howard, her position at Allatoona is more than just a job. It is her family.


  Coming out of a very difficult time last fall, Howard contemplated retirement. She wanted to spend more time with her own children and enjoy every moment she had with them.


  A playoff football game in late fall showed Howard exactly why she loved what she did every day. The students showed support for her on and off the field, as well as supporting the Turner’s Heroes cancer foundation -- named in honor of former Allatoona football standout Turner Cockrell, who died from cancer in 2018 -- that the school had adopted for athletic leadership.


  “To see all of the kids in the stands wearing their capes, to see all of the players on the field with stickers on their helmets, it was just one of those things that reminded me why I do my job,” said Howard, whose husband, John, is the athletic director at Woodland High School in Cartersville.


  All three athletic directors highlighted the importance of the people around them. They all had very high praise for their peers.


  “I genuinely believe that every athletic director in the state can win an award like this,” Howard said.

That said, we believe our and your ability to have a successful investment experience depends in large part on the willingness to "stay on the bus."

“Pomp and Circumstance” played as Faribault High School students walked across the stage in their gowns to receive their diplomas, and their families cheered in the crowd as teachers snapped photos.


  But even though the class of 2020 experienced these signature moments, the coronavirus pandemic made their milestone experience different from anything FHS has ever hosted. With one senior per vehicle, students rode to FHS with their families and waited their turn to hear their name announced outside FHS.


  Administration and teacher volunteer set up a drive-thru system in the FHS parking lot from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday. Students were invited to participate in the commencement according to their last names. The event also gave students a chance to drop off their iPads and textbooks and pick up their yearbooks.


  All photos from the two commencement events will be spliced together for a video that will air at 2 p.m. Sunday, June 7 on FCTV.


  Bailey Simon, a recent graduate of Faribault High School, didn’t expect her graduation ceremony to be anything special after the administration decided to shift the commencement to a virtual format. But just after walking across a small stage outside FHS and posing with cardboard cutouts of the administration team Thursday, she said, “It feels awesome. It feels amazing.”


  Being able to see her art teacher, Jackie DeMarais, one last time before furthering her education at St. Cloud State University was the icing on the cake for Simon. Finally, she could return the hall pass she took from DeMarais’ class before schools closed in response to COVID-19.


  FHS math teacher Claire Boatman volunteered to help manage the commencements. Around 30 staff members manned the different stations, directed traffic, marked off students’ names,and snapped photos.


  “I think this is making it more personal for families, so they can really be a part of it with their child and hear their name as they walk across the stage,” said Boatman. “ … It’s short but really sweet, I think.”


  As a teacher, Boatman said the individual commencements also provided a nice alternative to saying goodbye to her students virtually, where so much of the teacher-student interactions have happened in the past two months.


  FHS Assistant Principal Joe Sage also commented on the personal feel of the ceremony, during which staff celebrated one student at a time.


  “It has gone absolutely wonderfully,” said Sage. “I don’t think it could have been any better … It’s been really exciting to see kids smiling and enjoying this moment.”


  But, there’s no denying that 2020 seniors still missed out on the camaraderie of a full capacity commencement. Waiting in her families’ vehicle before walking across the stage to receive her diploma, Ashley Sanchez said while she doesn’t mind the format FHS chose, she had wanted a traditional ceremony.


  “I’d rather have it with all my friends,” said Sanchez. “I never got to say goodbye.”

TORONTO - Huawei Technologies Co.'s push to become a leading supplier of 5G technology in Canada appears to be in jeopardy after the Chinese tech giant's CFO suffered a legal setback in a B.C. court, prompting an angry response from Beijing.


  "The chance of them being a leading supplier is next to none. I think the chance of them being involved at all in the network is still up in the air," Jonathan Berkshire Miller, an expert in international security issues with the Macdonald Laurier Institute, said Thursday.


  His comments came a day after a B.C. Supreme Court judge ruled that the U.S. extradition case against Meng Wanzhou, a senior Huawei executive and daughter of the founder, can proceed to the next stage.


  Miller said Canada has attempted to keep its decision about Huawei's role in 5G networks separate from the Meng case but said China has retaliated by arresting two Canadians — ex-diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor — and blocking some Canadian exports to China, including canola.


  China's behaviour in the Meng case adds to the perception that it can't be trusted to allow Huawei to be independent of Beijing and abide by the local laws where it does business, Miller said.


  "I think there's going to be significant pressure (against Huawei) both domestically — from parts of the national security community — and also from our allies."


  For Canada's telecom industry and the federal government in Ottawa, Huawei has long been known as an important equipment supplier — one that U.S. officials consider a significant threat to national security.


  That's largely because Huawei is a major supplier of the equipment needed for wireless networks that could potentially be used to gather sensitive information for the Chinese government.


  IDC Canada vice-president Lawrence Surtees agreed that the Meng case may have given the Trudeau government a way to defer its decisions on Huawei but noted that the main government agency involved with the decision, the Canadian Security Establishment, hasn't found a reason to block the company.


  In addition, he said, excluding Huawei from Canada could be costly and complicated for some of the wireless networks building out their 5G networks, particularly the antennae and tower base stations that Huawei has installed in Canada for a decade.


  Besides that, he said Huawei has a major research and development centre for 5G and 6G technology in Ottawa.


  Fifth-generation technology — which the government and carriers expect to be a catalyst for future economic growth — will be introduced in stages over about a decade, although the exact timing of the stages is uncertain.


  Bell and Telus have used Huawei extensively in their fourth-generation networks and would be more affected by a Huawei ban than their rival Rogers Communications, which has predominantly used network gear from Sweden's Ericsson, Surtees said.

During this pandemic that's taken 100,000 American lives, Republicans have been fighting tooth and nail.


   


  Unfortunately, they aren't fighting for a "centralized coordinated plan" to take us though this pandemic as a top U.S. health expert, Dr. Rick Bright, testified is urgently needed. Nor are they fighting for more personal protective equipment for all essential workers.


   


  Even though Bright warned that without better planning, 2020 could be the "darkest winter in modern history," Republicans are only fighting to keep people from safely casting their ballots by mail.


   


  Republicans must have missed the memo that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends ballot-by-mail to keep people safe, and polls show a majority of Americans want this option.


   


  Texas Republicans are standing especially strong against this heresy. They find expanded absentee voting so abhorrent that they've asked the courts to stop it.


   


  Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton opposes expanding absentee ballots saying, "Protecting the integrity of elections is one of my most important and sacred obligations."


   


  It must have been difficult for Paxton to keep a straight face while making that statement since he recently got caught abandoning his "sacred obligations."


   


  The Texas Secretary of State, abetted by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Paxton, in 2019 attempted to purge nearly 100,000 suspected non-U.S. citizens from Texas' voter rolls. Thanks to civil rights groups, they were forced to end the purge when it was discovered they were wrongly targeting naturalized citizens.


   


  Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick also opposes expanding this type voting. He mustered whatever shred of dignity he had left after throwing grandparents under the bus to save the economy, and declared it would be the "end of America" if mail-in-voting was expanded.


   


  Patrick wasn't alone in clutching his pearls over the mere thought of more Texans using this voting method. Trump pulled out his imaginary presidential powers threatening to withhold federal funds from the battleground states Michigan and Nevada for legally expanding mail-in-voting.


   


  Trump claims voting-by-mail is ripe for fraud, but he's said many things that aren't true, like millions of people voted illegally for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Also, studies have found all forms of voting have very little fraud.


   


  Trump actually let slip the real reason Republicans are against a common sense, safe solution to voting during a pandemic. He said with these levels of voting "you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again."


   


  Republicans fear more people will vote, and that's what fuels their voter suppression tactics. Blocking the expansion of mail-in-ballots is just another tool in their toolbox.


   


  Other Republicans have also admitted they want less voter participation. For example, in 2011, Florida and Texas passed laws making it harder for Americans to vote, including imposing restrictions on voter registration drives that helped register minority voters.


   


  Former Florida state Sen. Mike Bennett, claimed he liked the Florida and Texas laws saying, "I want people in Florida to want to vote as bad as that person in Africa who walks 200 miles across the desert. This should not be easy."


   


  Republicans oppose expanded absentee voting not only out of fear it would increase voter turnout, but it could also restrict their other voter suppression tactics that often target minority communities.


   


  The GOP playbook includes purges of eligible (mostly minority) voters off the rolls, voter intimidation, long lines at Democratic leaning polling locations and a Texas voter ID law that a federal judge found "intentionally discriminatory."


   


  Since Texas has a history of pitifully low voter turnout, you'd expect our political leaders to encourage voter participation, not make it harder. We should demand Congress expand voting-by-mail not only for our safety, but to enhance our democracy.

Wall Street ended lower on Thursday following a late-session reversal, with Facebook weighing on the market after President Donald Trump said he would sign an executive order related to social media companies and would hold a news conference on China on Friday.


  Shares of Twitter Inc ended down 4.4% and Facebook Inc fell 1.6% following news of the executive order. The White House, after the market close, said Trump had signed the order, which removes a liability shield they currently enjoy.


  Trump said he was directing Attorney General William Barr to work with states to enforce their own laws against what he described as deceptive business practices by social media companies.


  Concerns about China-U.S. relations may also have driven the late decline. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told CNBC on Thursday that Hong Kong may now be needed to be treated like China when it comes to trade and other matters, echoing remarks by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday.


  "We are concerned (it's) saber rattling with China… It was just a big selloff because of that," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York, New York.


  Stocks had been higher for most of the session as investors continued to bet on a swift recovery from the coronavirus-driven economic slump.


  Worsening ties in recent weeks between the United States and China, the world's two largest economies, could pose a threat to the stock market's strong recovery from its steep selloff.


  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 147.63 points, or 0.58%, to 25,400.64, the S&P 500 lost 6.4 points, or 0.21%, to 3,029.73 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 43.37 points, or 0.46%, to 9,368.99.


  The S&P 500 is still up sharply from the low hit in March as a restart in business activity after weeks of shutdown and massive amounts of stimulus measures to support the economy have driven hopes of a strong recovery.


  Boeing Co said it had resumed production of its 737 MAX passenger jet at its Washington state plant, although at a "low rate."


  Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.16-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.97-to-1 ratio favored decliners.


  Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.25 billion shares, compared to the 11.26 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.


  The S&P 500 posted 18 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 67 new highs and seven new lows.

I have to look for the next big stress-relief song scene. For General Naird, I always want to look for some new opportunities for him -- and the odder and more surreal, the better to see how he might deal with some of the stresses and strains of his job. That's something that I'm kicking around at this point. What other odd, quirky ways of dealing with his life are we going to see? And whether it's a song or something else, I find stuff like that really funny, when something comes out of the blue in a surreal and an odd way. I'd like to see some more of that.

TORONTO - Huawei Technologies Co.'s push to become a leading supplier of 5G technology in Canada appears to be in jeopardy after the Chinese tech giant's CFO suffered a legal setback in a B.C. court, prompting an angry response from Beijing.


  "The chance of them being a leading supplier is next to none. I think the chance of them being involved at all in the network is still up in the air," Jonathan Berkshire Miller, an expert in international security issues with the Macdonald Laurier Institute, said Thursday.


  His comments came a day after a B.C. Supreme Court judge ruled that the U.S. extradition case against Meng Wanzhou, a senior Huawei executive and daughter of the founder, can proceed to the next stage.

“The most successful player I’ve had as far as big leagues is Allen Thomas.” Swink begins, speaking of the Morganton native who won a World Series ring with the Chicago White Sox in 2005 as the strength and conditioning coach for the club.


  “We went to Arizona just one time, four years ago, to see teams we hadn’t seen. I didn’t get any tickets for the White Sox, hadn’t even planned on going to see them. As it worked out, we usually take one day off. I called Allen and left him a message telling him we don’t have anything to do tomorrow so after you’re through let’s get something to eat and sit around and talk. He called back and said can you be here at 11 o’clock tomorrow?”


  Swink agreed to meet Thomas at the spring training facility at that time.


  “We pulled up. I went up right to that gate and said ‘We’re here to see Allen Thomas,’” Swink recalls. “He said ‘Yes sir, Mr. Swink, come right on in.’ We go to Allen’s door, and he’s not in his office and this big 6-foot-7 guy come walking through there and said, ‘Just sit down, Allen will be back in a minute.’ Allen came back and took us in the back and showed us the practice fields and everything was really sharp. As we was walking out there was a guy out there with a little boy and Allen says ‘That’s Jim Thome and his son.’”


  Swink was impressed but had seen major leaguers, even Hall of Famers on the field before, so he didn’t consider it out of the ordinary. Swink said Thomas then left them to tend to one his players before coming back moments later.


  “He said ‘Coach, I want to introduce you.’ I got up and started walking toward him. It was Jim Thome,” Swink said, adding that he became star-struck for the first time in his baseball life.


  “He came and sat down between me and Lisa and we talked like we had been friends for years. Just the nicest guy you’ll ever meet in your life. Hall of Fame player, Hall of Fame person. I mean, he didn’t know us from Adam and he sat there and talked and talked and signed a ball, and I was so awe-struck.”


  The moment did not go by without Swink having to educate his grandson.


  “I called my grandson and said I got an autograph from Jim Thome. He said, ‘Who is that?’ I said, ‘Look him up.’” Swink laughed.


  That same grandson, Mason Mozeley, now plays baseball for Freedom High School, which has compelled the Swinks to put their annual trips to spring training on hold for the time being so they can watch their grandson play.


  Whether more spring training is in Swink’s future plans or not, one thing is for certain. Baseball is in the plans and always will be.

Clearly, the premium credits we are seeing are not subject to the MLR rule; however, a similar analysis applies. TR 2011-04 clarified that insurers must provide any MLR rebates to the policyholder of an ERISA plan. However, while the DOL’s analysis was focused on MLR rebates, it recognized that distributions from carriers can take a variety of forms, such as “refunds, dividends, excess surplus distributions, and premium rebates.” Regardless of the form or how the carrier describes them, to the extent that a carrier credit, rebate, dividend, or distribution is provided to a plan governed by ERISA, then the employer must always consider whether it is a “plan asset” subject to Title I of ERISA. If it is, then as the party with authority and control over the “plan assets,” the employer is a fiduciary subject to Section 404 of ERISA and bound by the prohibited transactions provisions of Section 406. In other words, to the extent that a refund is a plan asset, it must be used for the exclusive benefit of plan participants, which may include using it to enhance plan benefits or returning it to employees in the form of a premium reduction or cash refund.

Second, from the perspective of asset quality, the old and the new accounting standards make no difference. The only change lies in the accounting treatment on paper and the timeline of recognition. As a result, for each quarter going forward, there will be two additional items on our income statement. One, is provision for contingent liabilities under the expense line, which accounts for the estimated credit loss associated with the contingent guarantee liabilities, driven by the new loan originated during the specific quarter, and the other one is, revenue from releasing of guarantee liabilities, under the revenue line for guarantee revenue released at amortized schedule, driven by the historical loan assets.

A complicare le cose sarebbe anche la fitta agenda del divo di "Titanic": Leonardo ha in cantiere diversi progetti tra cui il prossimo film di Adam McKay per Netflix con Jennifer Lawrence. Con un copione di Eric Roth, "Killers of the Flower Moon" è basato sul libro del 2017 con lo stesso titolo del giornalista David Grann che racconta come una serie di omicidi di ricchi nativi-americani nell'Oklahoma dei primi anni Venti dopo la scoperta di pozzi di petrolio sul loro territorio portò alla nascita dell'Fbi. Apple, che ha già co-prodotto "On the Rocks" con Bill Murray e la regia di Sofia Coppola, è entrata in gioco dopo che Paramount, acquistato tempo fa il progetto da Imperative Entertainment, si era innervosita per il budget da capogiro (200 milioni di dollari) e dato luce verde a Scorsese e al manager di DiCaprio Rick Yorn perché lo offrissero sul mercato.

Connor McDavid says the NHL's return-to-play plan is far from perfect, but "it's the best we got."


  The captain of the Edmonton Oilers was part of the NHL/NHLPA's Return to Play Committee that worked to come up with the blueprint announced earlier this week should the league be able to resume its season this summer.


  If the NHL, which paused its schedule March 12 because of the novel coronavirus pandemic, gets the green light from government and health officials, 24 teams would be left to compete for the Stanley Cup.


  The top-4 teams in the Eastern and Western Conferences would play separate mini-tournaments to determine seeding, while the remaining franchises would battle in best-of-five qualifying round series to complete 16-club playoff bracket.


  McDavid, whose Oilers would match up against the Chicago Blackhawks in the "play-in" round under the format, said on a video conference call Thursday that putting what was good for the league ahead of individual teams was paramount.

LITTLE Harry De Koning is a happy, smiling 14-month-old toddler who’s taken his first steps and, more recently, said his first word – mamma.


  That word brought tears to the eyes of his parents Kate and Andrew De Koning of Noosaville because it was a milestone they weren’t sure he’d reach.


  Harry was born deaf and received a cochlear implant on March 27.


  “He’s found his voice and he loves it – he’s a big chatterbox,” Mrs De Koning said.


  “He’s doing all the baby talk and babbling and there are all these different sounds he makes.


  “It melts your heart.


  “As a parent, you wonder if he’s going to have a normal life,” she said.


  Mrs De Koning said she and her husband didn’t really know who to turn to for help after receiving the diagnosis when Harry was about six weeks old.


  “Hearing that was a shock,” she said.


  “There is no family history (of hearing impairment), and our older daughter Stella, who is six, is fine.


  “The Brisbane Children’s Hospital put us in touch with the Hear and Say Centre and, without them, I don’t know what we would have done.”


  On Thursday Hear and Say launched a 24-hour online appeal called the Here to Stay Giving Day.


  It’s a new way to raise money this year because coronavirus restrictions have forced Hear and Say to cancel three of its annual fundraisers and transition many clinical services to online telepractice – both of which contribute to 75% of its overall income.


  Hear and Say CEO Chris McCarthy said although this was a challenging and financially tough time as a not-for-profit organisation, Hear and Say was committed to supporting families impacted by hearing loss for the long term.


  “We know that children and babies with hearing loss cannot wait – every day without sound can limit their potential, particularly those early years while a child’s brain is still actively developing,” McCarthy said.


  “We are now calling on the generous assistance of the community to ensure we can continue to provide support for children and adults alike so they can live life unaffected by hearing loss.”


  The Hear and Say: Here to Stay Giving Day is a 24-hour online fundraising event which will raise vital funds to safeguard Hear and Say’s work.


  “We know Australians are struggling and it can be tough to dig deep but we encourage those who can to band together and give, and what’s particularly exciting about this Giving Day is that every donation will be matched by one of our corporate and philanthropic supporters, which means Giving Day donors will see the impact of their gifts immediately doubled,” McCarthy said.

FARGO, N.D. - A man accused of fatally shooting a North Dakota police officer has an extensive criminal record that includes charges for interfering with police, fleeing, domestic assault and harassing public officials, court documents show.


  According to police, Salamah Pendleton opened fire Wednesday afternoon on two county sheriff’s deputies and two city police officers who tried to serve eviction papers on him at an apartment in Grand Forks. One of the officers was killed and a woman was found shot to death in the apartment.


  Authorities have not released the name of the officer who was killed. Details about the woman, her relationship to Pendleton and how she was killed also have not been provided.


  Pendleton, 41, was shot and wounded, as was a sheriff’s deputy who is in stable condition. Pendleton has not been charged in the shooting.


  But court documents show Pendleton has been charged with dozens of offences in the last 20 years, mostly misdemeanours and the majority of them while he lived in Iowa. He has been arrested numerous times for driving under suspension and driving without insurance, including last year in Grand Forks.


  The officer who died was the first killed on-duty in Grand Forks since 1966, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page website. It is the 33rd gunfire- related death of a North Dakota peace officer since the 1870s and the 58th overall death, the site shows.

As long a person tests negative, they could move about freely.

Besides monstrous CPU coolers, with up to 185 mm height, extra long graphics cards are supported along with mile-long PSUs. The longest PSU we have encountered so far was 225mm long, and as you can see from the table above, the Dark Base 900 can accommodate up to 284mm-long PSUs. If a company decides to release a 3 kW PSU in the future, this case will definitely support it.


  The Dark Base 900 case will hit the market at the beginning of July. The MSRP for the standard model is $199, whereas the Pro model will set you back $249. The most significant upgrades of the Pro model are the tempered glass side panel, the Qi connector, the RGB LED lighting strips and the PWM hub of the fan controller. For those added features, the extra 50 bucks is probably worth it.

The U.S. is likely to enter a period of “slow burn” of coronavirus cases through the summer, with coronavirus cases and deaths down from their peak but still taking a heavy toll, experts say. As the country passes the grim milestone of 100,000 deaths, experts say the pace of harm might be slower in the coming months, but there is unlikely to be a steep drop-off in the virus. There even could be some significant upticks as restrictions on businesses and movement are eased around the country. Risk looms even higher in the fall and winter, as experts expect a new spike in cases of the virus as the weather gets colder, combined with the added damage from flu season. (Sullivan, 5/26)
