When the Bruins bowed out of the playoffs this week in Toronto, dropping four straight to the Lightning after beating them in Game 1 of their Eastern Conference semifinal series, sportswriters started their team eulogies. The Black-and-Gold as we know them will cease to exist. Torey Krug is almost certainly going to leave via free agency, Tuukka Rask's future is up in the air after the goaltender left the bubble to return home to his family two games into the postseason; Zdeno Chara is 43 years old and showing signs that Father Time may finally get the best of him; and long-time team anchors Patrice Bergeron, David Krejci and Brad Marchand are all on the wrong side of 30.

In August there were 4.7 million fewer jobs than there were when Trump was inaugurated in January 2017. But if he leaves office in five months, and if the economy adds more than 1 million jobs each month, as happened in July and August, he could end up in the black. There are signs, though, that the gains are slowing as businesses have recalled many of the workers who were temporarily laid off from restaurants, bars, retailers and other businesses. So Biden’s prediction could come true.

My head feels thick and heavy right now. Likely from staring at too many screens for too long. It is 5 PM, when I physically and emotionally check out from both school and work. My day starts at 8 AM; it ends at 5 PM. On the dot. If there isn't a meeting in the morning, I like a leisurely start. But work is in a different timezone nowadays, which means 8 AM meetings. At least they're not at 7 AM.

Wanless’ real estate agent, Robb Nelson of Denver from Hall and Hall, said there are conflicting records on the square footage of the main house, but the insurance paperwork lists it at 6,400.
 The second house was built in 2010 for Wanless’ mother, who now lives on a 100-acre property.
 The bunkhouse and ranch manager’s house are 1,200 and 1,500 square feet, respectively.

Biden has in the months since winning the Democratic nomination sought to steer clear of Trump-lit brush fires, instead focusing his criticism of the President on the administration's mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic. The country's death toll is now creeping up on 200,000 and, according to a model from the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, could more than double that figure by January if the US continues on its current path.
