The Bible also tells us that the spirit may be willing but the flesh is weak. In light of our weaknesses as sinful people, our passions and best intentions can sometimes take a different path.
 Just looking at our own community there are people working very hard in the areas of domestic violence, drug epidemic, racial discrimination, moral and spiritual crisis, among other things. It is very clear that there are so many needs all around us, so many people are pressing for your time, energy, and finances, and very often there is much ingratitude among those we try to help.

Ensconced in the comfort and safety of their homes, kids could click on a map of houses in their neighborhood. Homeowners would receive a virtual trick-or- treat notification along with a photo of the little ghouls and boys. The homeowner could then click a button that would result in the delivery of candy to the kiddoes.
 If the homeowner liked the requester’s getup, the child would receive such outstanding sugary treats as chocolate bars or gummy bears or perhaps even chocolate-coated gummy bears. If the homeowner felt that the requester’s costume was lame, candy corn would be sent, although this could result in the homeowner’s abode being virtually TP’d.
 It’s been a difficult year for almost everything. Having a difficult Halloween simply seems to be par for the course.
 For instance, this spring our garden was so wet that we were torn between trying to drain it or simply calling it our new swimming pool. Not one to give up easily, I hastily plowed up a small emergency garden plot. It was extremely late in the season, so we purchased plants from a greenhouse instead of starting everything from seed. Doing this made me feel like somewhat of a wimp, but as I said, it’s been that kind of year.
 The emergency garden wasn’t much larger than a postcard, which greatly reduced the area available for my beloved cucurbits. There was only room for a few pumpkins and some squash. The fact that I wasn’t able to find any space for raising gourds drove me out of my gourd.
 As a result, the Pumpkin Fairy was unable to make his appointed rounds this fall.
 Each October, the Pumpkin Fairy would stealthily visit the homes of friends and relatives of ours and sneakily deposit prodigious pumpkins and gaudy gourds on their doorsteps. Nobody knows who the Pumpkin Fairy might be except for those who have caught him in the act of leaving pumpkins and gourds. Other than that, Pumpkin Fairy’s true identity is a secret that’s more closely guarded than the nuclear missile launch codes.
 That isn’t much of an inconvenience in the grand scheme of things. As a kid, I grew up with such a level of privation that – hold onto your hat – we had to make our own Halloween costumes!
 For my seven siblings and me, creating our Halloween costumes began with raiding a musty closet for old clothes that our parents no longer wore yet couldn’t bear to throw out. Many were the Halloweens when we boys would go trick-or-treating as a hobo or a clown but actually looked like dairy farm boys wearing oversized bib overalls.
 Our sisters fared much better. Through the creative deployment of colorful scarves and multiple layers of Technicolor makeup, they were able to turn themselves into fairly convincing facsimiles of gypsy ladies. They didn’t look at all like dairy farm girls wearing their mother’s old clothes.
 It’s been ages since trick-or-treaters have visited our farmhouse. But I’m prepared. I’ve acquired a supply of marshmallows and have memorized the launch codes for my candy cannon.

Yes, I would consider it. But when you study it more carefully, it becomes more like shame on everyone else for letting her slip on through.

Management and the Board of Directors of the Company have come to the very difficult decision that the Company can no longer continue its operations as a going concern after having used its best efforts over the preceding months, with the assistance of professional advisors, to refinance or sell the Company to a third party that would continue operating the business. The retail industry faced numerous challenges due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the second wave currently hitting our communities across Canada. Its already evident impact on consumer demand for Le Château's holiday party and occasion wear, which represents the core of our offering, has diminished Le Château's ability to pursue its activities. Regrettably, these circumstances leave the Company with no option other than to commence the Liquidation process.

Some insurance companies are taking a page out of their own history books: running their own doctors' offices and clinics. Though the strategy previously had mixed results, insurers think that by providing primary care for patients, they might reduce costly diseases and hospital stays in the long run.

First, do not be afraid to try something new. 4-H has something for everyone. One of my favorite parts of 4-H has been challenging myself and those around me to try different project areas or Youth in Action events. Each new activity I tried taught me more about myself and the world around me. Special Foods taught me how to plan and prepare a well-balanced meal, Public Presentations transformed me into a confident speaker, judging schools made me a conscientious shopper, and project areas like leadership and citizenship instilled in me the importance of being an engaged community member.
 Second, be bold and speak up, 4-H is what you make it. If you have an idea for a new project day, a unique idea for your club’s booth, or an organization you want your club to volunteer with, speak up. As a 4-H member I have seen the importance of advocating both for myself, and for those around me. 4-H has given me the courage and confidence to be a leader for my club, my community, my country, and my world.
 Third, set goals and work until you achieve them. Whether your goal is to exhibit 10 projects at Achievement Days, earn a spot on the state judging team, prepare a radio speaking ad, or give a speech at a club meeting, maximize your time in 4-H by acting intentionally. Both short-term and long- term goals will help you take full advantage of everything 4-H has to offer.
 4-H has helped me transform from a shy eight-year-old girl into a confident young woman, ready to MAKE THE BEST BETTER.
