So, just so we're clear, we had Fast and Furious, a dubious operation named after an equally dubious series of movies. In the operation, gun shop owners were allowed by the government to sell guns to individuals they knew were straw buyers, likely for Mexican drug cartels. The idea was to keep track of the guns and figure out where they were going and how they were getting there.

As an illustration, the digital token witnessed a 1,900 percent rally in 2017 whereby its price touched an all-time high of $20,000. However, a spectacular bust followed soon after which saw Bitcoin’s price collapsing to just over $3,000 in December 2018.

  Finally, the approaching “halving” event in May 2020 may also be one of the factors fueling the token's rise. Currently, miners are awarded 12.5 Bitcoins for every block mined. These awards are cut in half every four years to keep a lid on the cryptocurrency’s inflation and the mechanism is baked into the token’s underlying code. By May 2020, the reward will be again cut in half to 6.25 new Bitcoins for every block mined. For reference, previous halving events have also been heralded by significant increases in the crytpocurrency's price.

At the moment, Cushman said the department does not immediately have any new implementations in terms of dining coming up on campus, but they are working on some new programs on the back end. One program Cushman said he is most excited about is improving the Dining Bucks program to make it easier for students in the long run.
 “So, it’s just another way of kind of creating those better options for students and that’s again, part of Hospitality Services and what our mission is, is to do the best thing that we can for Red Raiders,” he said.
 In the fall 2019 semester, Hospitality Services implemented self-ordering kiosks at The Market in Stangel/Murdough. Over the fall semester, Cushman said the kiosks were reworked in how they are operated, such as the streamlining of some of the menus, as well as people being able to customize their orders however they would like.
 Cushman said Hospitality Services is also looking at changing some of the pickup points at The Market to make it clearer and more concise. The menu and culinary teams are going through and looking at the menus to make sure those customization options are still there. Some of the items people have been requesting that had been removed are also potentially coming back.
 Cushman said he believes the kiosks in The Market are what people will start seeing in restaurants everywhere and said they are always going to be in constant evolution.

“We always want to make sure that we’re listening to students, not just students, but faculty and staff and anybody in the Red Raider community who can dine with us, so we want to make sure if it’s not working, then we’re going to do what we need to do to make it work,” he said. “So, we do see some changes that will come in this spring to the service styles over there. It’s been interesting, you know, it’s always fun when you bring in something new on campus.”
 Another thing Cushman said he is looking forward to doing this spring is hosting more unique events on campus. Hospitality Services’ chef Dewey McMurray has been working with some companies to bring in some guest chefs to do a Mardi Gras dinner at The Commons on Feb. 25 and on May 5 for Cinco de Mayo at Fresh Plate. The annual chili cook-off is another event Cushman said he is looking forward to on Feb. 19 in the Student Union Building ballroom.
 “That’s kind of some of the fun stuff that we’re looking to do for the semester is just kind of, you know, really showcase some of these unique products and some of the talented chefs that are in our in our department, but then also bring in some, some new faces to you,” Cushman said. “But that’s kind of it, you know, everything that we do from Hospitality Services’ standpoint, we do pride ourselves on being Red Raiders feeding Red Raiders. And so, we really want to make sure we are supporting all students in their academic pursuits and how we do that by feeding them and making sure you guys are ready to go and achieve your goals.”

Sullo sfondo di una fiera di paese, in un pomeriggio qualunque, tra la pesca delle oche e le gare sfrenate in autoscontro con i ragazzi desiderati, si staglia la storia di Susi - una ragazza ancora acerba che si affaccia per la prima volta alla complessita della vita, dell'amore e del sesso - che si intreccia con quella di suo nonno, uomo pieno di rimpianti e disposto a tutto pur di riguadagnare piccole passioni. Susi vive l'intensita dello stare insieme, le gelosie, l'eccitazione e la sfrontatezza che negli anni dell'adolescenza sembrano assorbire ogni cosa. Ci sono le amiche, tra complicita e dinamiche egoistiche, c'e la voglia di affermare la propria liberta, di innamorarsi e di scoprire i propri corpi; ma c'e anche il racconto del divario generazionale tra Susi e il nonno, di un dialogo che sembra impossibile.

We hadn't had the new microwave that long when, all of a sudden, it decided it just didn't want to microwave anymore.      "You had one job," I said to the microwave, chastising it after it failed to reheat some leftovers. "Is that really so hard?"      Naturally, I had no idea what went into making a microwave microwave. I assumed it probably had something to do with the sun, since it used microwaves, and maybe also radio waves or ultraviolet rays, and therefore there was surely a solar panel installed somewhere, that made it work, as well as a transistor radio and sunscreen. Since I had no experience with microwaves or radio waves or UV waves (except that one time when I was seven and I got a really bad sunburn), I thought this was all well out of my limited range of appliance repair knowledge and decided to call in a professional.      I looked online for a repairman in my area and chose Mike's Microwave repair because it had a number of good reviews and also, Mike and Microwave both begin with an M and I like alliteration. I had to wait two weeks for Mike to show up because apparently, there was a sudden epidemic of microwave deaths at the same time that mine pooped out. It was like some kind of microwave flu that must have been transmitted over the airwaves, or maybe the radio waves, I couldn't be certain.      By the time Mike finally arrived I was beside myself. I was a child of the microwave generation and never realized that food could also be reheated in an actual oven, so for two weeks I ate cold leftovers and brooded about how difficult life was without a microwave.      "I think it might be the fuse," said Mike when he finally arrived and did triage on my microwave. "It should be an easy fix, but there's a chance I might have to do open oven surgery. I need you to sign a release."      "A release?" I said. "For what?"      "Acknowledging that the appliance was not functioning when I arrived and nothing I did caused it to further malfunction."      "Fine," I said and signed the form. "But before you do anything, you should try pointing the satellite dish in a different direction to see if that solves the problem, because not only is the microwave broken, but also, our TV isn't getting very good reception."      He looked at me like I was one burner short of stovetop. "They have nothing to do with each other."      "What?" I said.      "Your microwave and your TV," he said. "Completely unrelated."      "Got it," I said. "But could you check the TV when you're done with the microwave, anyway?"      "I only do kitchen appliances," he said.      "But the TV is in the kitchen," I replied. Then I recalled that the ad said, Mike's Microwaves, and not Mike's Microwaves and TVs, so I decided to let it go.      I watched the one TV channel that worked well while Mike did surgery on the microwave. But when I decided to switch channels, all of a sudden, at the exact same time, the microwave whirred to life.      "Hah!" I yelled. "I fixed the microwave!"      "No, you didn't," said Mike. "I did. I put in a new fuse."      "I'm not so sure, Mike." I said assuredly. "I was on CNN and when I switched to HGTV, the microwave started to work again."      "I told you, they're not related," he argued.      I shrugged. "If you want to believe that, that's fine," I said. "I don't want to make waves."

But Jon-Paul Hedge, Director, in his report to the meeting said the projected cost for such a significant build is around £61.97million, there are no obvious funding routes to secure it, and it would also fall short of many public perceptions of delivering a venue to rival the likes of The Theatre Royal in Plymouth.
 His report added: “Initial costings showed the capital cost of a multipurpose venue was likely to be prohibitive. To turn designs into reality, funding would need to come from a plethora of sources and the likelihood of garnering sufficient support to find the project at the scale and ambition is ‘low’.”

RMC Primary Care-Bamberg reopens
 Carotid artery disease is a form of atherosclerosis, or a buildup of plaque, in the two main arteries in the neck that supply oxygen-rich blood to the brain. If left untreated, carotid artery disease can often lead to stroke; it is estimated to be the source of stroke in up to a third of cases, with 427,000 new diagnoses of the disease made every year in the U.S. alone.
 “TCAR is an important new option in the fight against stroke, and is particularly suited for the large portion of patients we see who are at higher risk of complications from carotid surgery due to age, anatomy, or other medical conditions,” Franga said. “Because of its low stroke risk and faster patient recovery, I believe TCAR represents the future of carotid repair.”

Cllr Phil Bialyk, leader of the council, added: “We have to be realistic on the options, but we are not just going to put this on the shelf and will ask scrutiny to look at the funding sources. We will be proactive, which is what we do as a city, but it is very difficult.
 “We need to celebrate what we do have in Exeter, like The Phoenix and The Barnfield, and lots of others venues where amateur productions are performed. More importantly, we are the third best local authority with the maximum spend on culture, around 53p per head, which is way above and double most local areas.
 “We are not shelving it and it is a passion we want to deliver, and we will try our very best to bring about the entertainment venue for Exeter that the people want.”
