P Varavara Rao (81), Telugu poet and social activist, who was lodged at Taloja Jail in Navi Mumbai in connection with the Elgar Parishad case and was admitted to Sir JJ Hospital on Monday (July 13) afternoon after his health condition worsened, tested coronavirus positive (Covid-19) on Thursday, much to the dismay of his family members because they had warned of it earlier this week through a press release.           Dr. Ranjit Mankeshwar, dean of Sir JJ Hospital, confirmed that Rao has contracted SARS-CoV-2, which causes the viral disease.          "He is asymptomatic and stable. He will either shifted to GT Hospital or St George Hospital. His oxygen saturation level is above 95%. He will be treated with symptomatic drugs," said Dr. Mankeshwar.          The family in a statement said, "The Covid-19 finding highlights the criminal negligence of Maharashtra jail authorities, who have been repeatedly warned about the danger of the viral outbreak in the Taloja Jail, and the fragile condition of the poet-writer. It is a matter of concern, too, that the trial court handling the Bhima Koregaon/Elgar Parishad case turned a deaf ear to pleas for medical bail, despite the poor health condition of Rao and the threat posed by the pandemic."           The statement also alleged that the neglect has led to another accused in the case, Vernon Gonsalves, who looked after Rao in Taloja Jail, at grave risk.          Rao's wife Hemlata, his two daughters and nephew Venugopal had met him at Sir JJ hospital on Wednesday and was appalled to see him "lying in a pathetic condition such as urine-soaked clothes for hours and with little nursing and treatment were available at the healthcare facility".          They also expressed their apprehension about the move to shift Rao to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)-run St George Hospital, whose healthcare facilities are few and far between.          "This is bad news. St Geroge Hospital has a poor healthcare record. It's hardly a place, where Rao stands a chance to recover from the viral infection. The only relief for him is: if the Bombay high court (HC), which is hearing his bail plea on medical grounds on Friday, accedes to his request and orders him to shift to a private superspeciality hospital," the statement added.          Rao had moved the HC appealing against the order of the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court, which had rejected his interim bail application on June 26.           Rao had sought interim bail on the grounds of failing health and susceptibility to Covid-19.          On May 28, Rao was taken to Sir JJ Hospital after he had lost consciousness. Later, he was discharged on June 1.          At that time, the family members had alleged that he was hurriedly discharged in a bid to obstruct his bail plea before the special (NIA) court, a fear that came true on June 26.          The NIA, which had taken over the Elgar Parishad case from Pune Police in February, had opposed the bail plea, as Rao was charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, where there is no provision to grant him temporary bail.          NIA had submitted that the jail authorities could be directed to ensure that Rao was provided proper medical attention, whenever required.          Earlier, on January 1, 2018, violence erupted between Dalits and Marathas near the village of Bhima Koregaon in Pune district, where thousands of Dalits had gathered to mark the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Koregaon.          In that battle, the British Army's Dalit Mahar soldiers had defeated the Brahmin Peshwa rulers of the Maratha empire.          The commemoration took place a day after an event in Pune called the Elgar Parishad was held.          The Pune Police conducted a preliminary probe and claimed that the violence in Bhima Koregaon was the result of speeches made at the Elgar Parishad event.          They alleged that banned Maoist groups organised the event, and a first information report (FIR) was also filed.          In June 2018, the Pune Police arrested five activists and lawyers from Pune, Nagpur, and Delhi - Surendra Gadling, Mahesh Raut, Sudhir Dhawale, Rona Wilson, and Shoma Sen - for their alleged links to the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist), and also for organising the Elgar Parishad event.          In August 2018, the police arrested four more activists - Sudha Bharadwaj, Arun Ferreira, Gonsalves, and Rao.          While Gautam Navlakha and Dr. Anand Teltumbde were arrested on April 14 this year, taking the total number of the accused in the case to 11.

National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci, MD, encouraged people to turn to respected medical authorities  --  including himself  --  for answers during the pandemic, during a Tuesday webinar co-sponsored by Georgetown University's Global Health Initiative.For the most part ... you can trust respected medical authorities, said Fauci, a member of the White House coronavirus task force who has lately come under fire from the Trump administration. I believe I'm one of them. So, I think you can trust me.Attacks against Fauci have come from the White House  --  with the Washington Post reporting that the latter leaked a document stating that several White House officials are concerned about the number of times Dr. Fauci has been wrong on things  --  and fellow task force member Adm. Brett Giroir, MD. During a Meet the Press interview Sunday, Giroir, assistant secretary for health, said that he respects Fauci a lot...[but] Dr. Fauci is not 100% right and he also doesn't necessarily... have the whole national interest in mind.More recently, Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro penned a USA Today op-ed claiming that Fauci has been wrong about everything I have interacted with him on, although the White House distanced itself from Navarro's opinion piece, according to the Washington Post. Fauci told The Atlantic that he found the criticism of his record bizarre.Webinar moderator Mo Elleithee, founding executive director of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service in Washington, seemed to be giving Fauci an opportunity to respond to his detractors during an online interview.Elleithee asked for advice for himself and his own family, and Fauci encouraged him to stick with respected medical authorities who have a track record of telling the truth; who have a track record of giving information and policy and recommendations based on scientific evidence and good data.Fauci added that it's entirely understandable that the public can get mixed messages, and then get a bit confused about what they should do.Fauci also addressed the issue of reopening schools. As a general principle, we should try as best as possible to keep the children in school, Fauci said, citing the profound impact on working families, and the negative effects on children as well as other aspects of society of keeping children home.But he noted that the answers to school reopening will vary depending on geography and what the dynamics of the outbreak are in your particular region.In COVID-19 hotspots, the safety of the children and teachers must be factored into the decision, he emphasized.If you're in a situation where you're in outbreak mode, then you leave it up to the local individuals ... of making a decision based on the judgment of making sure that safety of the children and safety of the teachers are paramount, Fauci stated.Fauci was more hopeful on the topic of vaccines, citing data from a phase I trial that showed really good neutralizing antibodies and no adverse events with the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. That candidate will move forward in the trial process, and other candidates will follow at the end of the summer or mid-fall, Fauci said.So, I think we're in a pretty good place when it comes to vaccines, he said.However, he acknowledged that when a vaccine is approved and readied for widespread rollout, decisions may need to be made about who will get it first.I hope and I think we will, have enough [vaccine] for everyone who needs it, he said.Fauci stressed that he would defer to ethicists on such a decision, but as a general principle, he recommended giving the vaccine first to those who are most vulnerable and [who] would most benefit from it, such as first responders, healthcare providers, essential members of society, [and] people with underlying conditions. Hopefully, you could quickly get everybody vaccinated ... but sometimes you have to make difficult decisions.If things work out the way we hope they do, I think by the end of this year and the beginning of calendar year 2021, we will have enough information to know whether the [vaccine] candidates that we're dealing with are safe and effective, he said. Hopefully...we'll be able to distribute it in an equitable manner to a large number of people.

India and the European Union (EU) have had a relationship based on common values -- but not much else. The recent summit is the latest step in a 21st century reset. Common concerns about the United States' (US) destructive unilateralism and China's aggressive imperialism are forcing Brussels and New Delhi to look at the big picture. The new convergence is about working together on multilateral problems. The climate crisis tops the list but preserving international institutions and the security of the high seas and cyberspace also figure. The EU has put aside its tendency of preaching to India about human rights. Both sides have lowered ambitions regarding trade and investment negotiations. As the world order gets shakier, India and the EU have sensibly decided to worry about the big picture.                   Even here, moving forward will require a lot of concerted effort. The EU struggles to take common positions on sensitive geopolitical issues. Preference for Chinese profits over principles by Germany and other governments means Europe is all over the place when it comes to Beijing. The Europeans remain suspicious and ill-informed about the philosophy of the Narendra Modi government. New Delhi is more excited about future relations with Brexit Britain than it is with Brussels. The relationship needs a core focus, one that works at many different policy levels and has a good chance of generating results. The obvious answer to this is climate and that is where the two sides must concentrate their energies.

WASHINGTON — An apartment building in Chicago, one of the most densely populated cities in America, is not an obvious place to raise crops. But a surprising number of apartment dwellers claim to be doing just that as they try to take advantage of a federal aid program intended to help small businesses survive the pandemic.
 The Small Business Administration in recent weeks has been inundated with calls from people claiming to run odd businesses in odd places, all attracted by the prospect of a quick $10,000 advance on a government loan, according to a person with direct knowledge of the program who asked not to be identified discussing confidential matters.
 Suspicious requests from Chicago have grown so numerous that SBA managers recently alerted their front-line staff to be on the lookout for Windy City paperwork. A recent advisory also asked staffers to report applications containing one of several additional red flags, including those with just enough employees to qualify for the maximum $10,000 payment. Callers to the SBA's application hotline who struggle to answer basic questions about their business or who are laser-focused on obtaining the advance rather than discussing loan terms were also earmarked for extra scrutiny.
 "It's a feeding frenzy," said the person with knowledge of the program. "A lot of these are going through with little or no due diligence."
 At issue is the SBA's Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL), a long-standing government program Congress expanded in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic. With a spotty track record even in routine operations, the program appears to have been overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of the economic catastrophe unleashed by the medical emergency.
 "It was treated as an orphan initially," said Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, ranking Democrat on the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee. "They clearly were not ready for this type of responsibility and they did not gear up for it."

The Punjab government has joined the list of states to have fixed rates for treatment of coronavirus patients in hospitals amid reports of inconsistent rates and overcharging. The range varies from a minimum prescribed rate of Rs 8,000 a day for treatment of moderate Covid-19 cases at non-NABH accredited hospitals to Rs 18,000 a day for treatment of critical patients at private medical colleges.The state government on Thursday issued an order to fix Rs 10,000 as daily charge for all private medical colleges and Rs 9,000 for NABH (National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers). Non-NABH accredited hospitals are allowed to charge up to Rs 8,000 per day for moderate sickness, reported news agencies.For severe sickness requiring ICU care without a ventilator, the daily rates have been capped at Rs 15,000, Rs 14,000 and Rs 13,000 respectively for the above-mentioned categories of hospitals.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe government order has also fixed the rates for treatment of very severe covid-19 patients who require critical care at Rs 18,000, Rs, 16,500 and Rs 15,000 for all private medical colleges, NABH-accredited hospitals & non-NABH accredited hospitals respectively.All the above-mentioned rates are inclusive of PPE cost, according to the statement released by the government.The Punjab government had constituted a committee under Dr K K Talwar for fixing rates after receiving several complains of overcharging.

My favorite fire pit on this list is made by Tiki, a company that began with the familiar Tiki bamboo torch over 60 years ago. Now, Tiki offers a fire pit that's large, sturdy, and attractive. Priced almost $300 more than its budget rivals, it's the most expensive fire pit by far in this roundup. Still, its performance, ease of use, and superior style make this pit worth the investment.
 The steel and stained wood pit doesn't just look good. The Tiki Brand Fire Pit has a clever airflow system that recycles hot smoke back into the fire chamber. During my testing, it was easy to ignite, firing up in about 5 minutes, and fully burning in 15.
 It also generated far less smoke than the other fire pits I tested, especially after its logs caught fully, usually at about the 15-minute mark. Only the Solo Stove Ranger burned wood with less smoke emission, its fuel burning fiercely in 5 minutes. The Tiki Fire Pit's logs burned efficiently as well, lasting for hours.
 Because of its large (16 inches in diameter) mouth, it's easier to share the fire with multiple people. The Solo Stove Ranger is smaller by comparison, its metal fire ring is 10 inches in diameter. Kids gathering around to roast s'mores need to be careful though. All surfaces of the Tiki fire pit, including its metal lip are scalding hot after the fire is lit. It also takes time to cool after the flames die down.
 I do appreciate the Tiki Brand pit's removable ash tray. It's the only product in this group to have one. It makes for easy cleanup. The pit puts out a generous amount of heat as well. While that's perhaps not ideal for hot summer nights, it's excellent when the temperature dips during the fall and winter. Tipping the scales at 45 pounds, this fire pit is heavy. Think twice before you position it, and get help when you do.

The Berkeley Police Department said Monday it does not comment on council legislation.                          In a joint statement, the police unions for Los Angeles, San Jose and San Francisco said that reckless driving, speeding, driving while under the influence are all dangerous “traffic” enforcement violations.                           “We do not believe that the public wants lax enforcement of those incidents by non-sworn individuals,” the unions said. “Traffic stops are some of the most dangerous actions police officers take. What happens when the felon with an illegal gun gets pulled over by the parking police? Nothing good, we’re sure of that.”                          The largely affluent and progressive San Francisco suburb of 120,000 has led the country on environmental, cultural and equity issues.

Asked about the attacks lodged against him by anonymous White House officials, Fauci said he “cannot figure out in my wildest dreams why they would want to do that. I think they realize now that that was not a prudent thing to do, because it’s only reflecting negatively on them.”          As for his relationship with the president, Fauci said it has changed over time. While he used to speak one-on-one with Trump, Fauci said, “I haven’t done that in a while. But a day does not go by that I am not in contact with Debbie Birx, with Bob Redfield, or Steve Hahn and others,” he said referring to other members of the White House coronavirus task force. “My input to the president goes through the vice president. But clearly, the vice president — literally every day — is listening to what we have to say, there’s no doubt about that.”           Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said on Fox News that Navarro was entitled to his opinion but “I would prefer that he not write it.”          “Everybody’s on the same page,” Kennedy added. “I know the vice president thinks the world of Dr. Fauci.

India and the European Union (EU) have had a relationship based on common values -- but not much else. The recent summit is the latest step in a 21st century reset. Common concerns about the United States' (US) destructive unilateralism and China's aggressive imperialism are forcing Brussels and New Delhi to look at the big picture. The new convergence is about working together on multilateral problems. The climate crisis tops the list but preserving international institutions and the security of the high seas and cyberspace also figure. The EU has put aside its tendency of preaching to India about human rights. Both sides have lowered ambitions regarding trade and investment negotiations. As the world order gets shakier, India and the EU have sensibly decided to worry about the big picture. Even here, moving forward will require a lot of concerted effort. The EU struggles to take common positions on sensitive geopolitical issues. Preference for Chinese profits over principles by Germany and other governments means Europe is all over the place when it comes to Beijing. The Europeans remain suspicious and ill-informed about the philosophy of the Narendra Modi government. New Delhi is more excited about future relations with Brexit Britain than it is with Brussels. The relationship needs a core focus, one that works at many different policy levels and has a good chance of generating results. The obvious answer to this is climate and that is where the two sides must concentrate their energies.

The Telluride can hold up to 21 cubic feet behind its third row, while the Highlander is limited to 16 cubic feet. That’s enough of a difference to allow you to fit the equivalent of a couple extra carry-on suitcases in the Telluride. The advantage swaps if you fold those third-row seats down; the Toyota can hold 48.4 cubic feet to the Kia’s 46 cubic feet. The maximum cargo capacity with the second and third rows stowed leans back in favor of the Telluride’s 87 cubic feet to the Highlander’s 84.3 cubic feet.
 Winner: Telluride
 THE DRIVING EXPERIENCE
 The Kia Telluride and Toyota Highlander are essentially neck and neck in regard to performance specifications. Both have a standard V6 engine that provides about 290 horsepower, and both offer optional all-wheel drive. In Edmunds’ testing, these SUVs accelerated from 0 to 60 mph in 7.5 seconds, which is an average time for this class of vehicle. Around town, however, the Highlander feels a little quicker to respond from when you put your foot on the accelerator to when the vehicle begins to move.

Throwing open the French doors of my guest room at Bernardus Lodge & Spa in Carmel Valley, California, and mid-sip from a glass of the resort's eponymous Sauvignon Blanc, I ruminated on the risks and rewards of travel during this unsettling time.               I was distracted for a moment, not only by the crisp and expressive Monterey County wine in my hand, but by a rabbit hopping among the lavender blooms just a few feet away. I rather envied this cotton-tailed cutie who appeared blissfully unaware of the travails of life during a pandemic.               This Forbes-rated, four-star open luxury resort was just three hours from my home in Napa Valley, for which I was grateful, as driving seems the safest option for a travel adventure now. With my four-legged travel companion, Freddie, in tow, and my next-door neighbor, Tara -- the two closest connections I've had for the past several months -- we hit the road, giddy at the prospect of a change of scenery.              Arriving at Bernardus, we were greeted by a masked bellman who explained where to park, since there would be no valet service on this visit. We were offered and accepted, however, assistance with our luggage. Check-in was swift, with a plexiglass partition at the front desk, social distancing in place and a reminder about mandatory mask-wearing on the property. All signed in, I availed myself a dollop of hand sanitizer from the bottle I spotted in front of me, available for guest use.              This resort has remained open for business throughout the pandemic, which means they've had plenty of time to adhere and adjust to California's health guidelines for guests. The lodge, in fact, was almost fully booked while I was there. Yet, there's plentiful open space on the property for guests to stroll, including an exquisite rose garden within which raised beds of organic produce are grown exclusively for use by Executive Chef Cal Stamenov and his sensory-stoking culinary offerings.               Everywhere I turn, lavender is in aromatic bloom, even between the purplish artichokes stretched skyward from Cal's garden. Notably, the rose garden is strategically sited so as to frame the view of Bernardus' estate vineyards, with its backdrop of the Santa Lucia Mountains.               Reservations are required for outdoor seating at the resort's Lucia Restaurant & Bar, and diners share a single-use paper menu at every meal.               Tara and I feel almost mischievous as we remove our face masks in order to eat, yet we were also conscious of the increased risk to the waitstaff. We accepted a pour of the sparkling rose we brought in celebration of our outing and gleefully toasted to a dinner we did not have to cook ourselves.              Only one thing could have made the experience feel more decadent -- to be seated at the Chef's Table within the kitchen where the walls are adorned with scratched signatures of various celebrities, including culinary great and native Californian Julia Child. That experience is not being offered until post-pandemic.              Honestly, it has been so long since I've been in a restaurant that I'd almost forgotten how much pleasure there is in dining out.               After that, I was primed for a hot, detoxifying salt bath in the luxuriously deep soaking tub in my room, followed by a nightcap while seated next to the in-room fireplace. Minutes later, I fell into a trance-like sleep.              The next day, Tara, Freddie and I got back in the car for a drive into the nearby village of Carmel. There, a full mile of artisan shops and more than 20 tasting rooms beckoned. But wait, many of those rooms were not open, thanks to COVID-19. So, our plan switched to a walk on the beach at Carmel-by-the-Sea.               Yikes! The temperature by the ocean was at least 20 degrees cooler than the valley, bringing on the shivers, so we hiked back uphill, donned our masks and power-shopped for a while. We grabbed a snack at an outdoor courtyard restaurant before retreating back to our secluded deck at the Lodge. That evening, takeout pizza from Lucia Restaurant seemed like the ideal solution for supper. We scarfed it down while polishing off the last of the Bernardus Sauvignon Blanc.               How did it feel to travel, sleep, shop and eat in the age of COVID-19? Truth be told, the adventure satiated my need to get out and feel normal, and I was grateful for the opportunity to do it, especially at such a lovely spot as Bernardus, but I could not shake a deep awareness of being "on guard," never forgetting all of the extreme precautions that I -- and others employed in the hospitality industry -- took to make it happen. Odd and eerie at times? Yes. But worth it? Absolutely.              Charlene Peters travels the world to discover culinary dishes and worthy wines to share with readers.

Government, on September 9, 2019 started implementation of digital tax stamps on sprits, water, beer, soda wine and tobacco after fending off resistance from manufacturers, who had said the stamps would introduce a cost burden on their operations.               However, yesterday Mr Simon Kaheru, the Coca-Cola Beverages Africa corporate affairs manager, told Daily Monitor they were experiencing “operational issues with the digital tax stamps equipment that sometimes interferes with production.                However, he said: “The most important point now is for government to finally confirm that the cost of the stamps is not moved to manufacturers and consumers - especially during this Covid-19 period.”                Shifting the burden, he said, would save manufacturers from a situation in which they would have to dig deeper to amid revenues challenges resulting from Covid-19-related disruptions.                           Whereas the cost of digital tax stamps remains a critical point of contention, Mr Vincent Sseruma, the URA commissioner for corporate affairs, yesterday said the fee charged on the stamp is very minimal, noting that the charge on a mineral water bottle is as low as Shs35 or Shs50.                           “When those costs were determined, it was done in a way that they don’t cause significant change on the consumer price,” he said, adding that matters related to the complaints arising from producer associations and the stakeholders cannot be handled by URA because the law has no provision within which they can be handled.                           digital tax stamps improve compliance                While digital tax stamps remain a controversial tax, a document prepared by URA last month indicated that at least 84 spirits companies, nine wines and four beer manufacturers and 42 water producers had been brought into the tax fold after years of evasion.                           The document, which highlighted the progress of digital tax stamps since implementation, indicates that before September 9, 2019, there had only been nine tax compliant spirits companies and none for wine producers while compliance among water manufacturers had been weak.                          For instance, the document indicated, tax compliance among water producers had within a year grow from 16 per cent to 58 per cent while that of spirits and beer producers had grown from 9 per cent to 43 and from 3 per cent to 7 per cent, respectively.

The 2021 Ford Bronco plans to come out swinging against the Jeep Wrangler, there's no doubt about it, and it's clear the Blue Oval looked at every area possible -- right down to the tires wrapping the wheels.
 Motor1 reported Wednesday the Bronco will not show the "Wrangler" name on its Goodyear tires, for reasons. It sounds a tad petty, but Ford more than likely didn't want the rivaling SUV's name splashed across the Bronco's meaty tires. Which Bronco trims will actually be equipped with the tires remains unclear still since there are plenty of tire options -- six total -- for buyers to choose from.
 Ford did not immediately return Roadshow's request for comment.
 According to the report, the Wrangler name will still be present on the tires in one way, though. The inward side of the tires will still show the name, but otherwise, Bronco owners won't see it as good guy Goodyear scrubs it from the most prominent area.
 At the end of the day, owners probably wouldn't have had much of an issue. Goodyear Wrangler tires are a popular choice for many vehicles. But you can't fault Ford for trying to keep its flashy new Bronco as pure as possible. Reservations remain open for the Bronco before the SUV starts shipping out to dealers next spring. If you had your eye on a First Edition though, those are gone.

A village of former guerrilla fighters who laid down their arms in a historic 2016 peace deal was relocated by Colombian authorities Wednesday after 11 of its residents were murdered over the past three years.             The Roman Ruiz Reincorporation Center in northwest Colombia was home to a group of ex-Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia fighters and their families, who lived in small prefabricated homes and worked on projects that included raising chickens and a coffee farm.             The village’s entire population of 94 people loaded their belongings onto trucks and boarded double-decker buses to move to the banana-growing region of Uraba, where the government has rented 137 hectares (340 acres) of land for the group and promised to help them build new homes.             “We’ve been uprooted,” said Marco Urbano, a spokesman for the group of ex-FARC fighters who was in the mountain village overseeing the move. “Most of the people here had been working for three years on farming projects and now they will have to start from scratch.”

Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Mohammed Jashim issued a 10-day remand order against Shahed and Masud on an application from the detective police.
          “Shahed broke down in tears while standing on the dock. He said his father died from the coronavirus. The lawyers told him to calm down,” Abdullah Abu, chief prosecutor of Dhaka Metropolitan Judge's Court, told bdnews24.com.          When the hearing began, a wailing Shahed appeared to be collapsing in the dock and was given water by police, Abdullah Abu told bdnews.com.           Prior to that episode, Shahed had claimed that Regent Hospital was the first to dedicate itself to the treatment of COVID-19 at a time when no other private hospital came forward to treat for coronavirus patients.          “The virus had infected me and my family from the hospital. We finally recovered and transferred money to the state-run Sonali Bank to renew the licence of the hospital. But the law enforcers sealed off the hospital and its branches in an unfair way,” Shahed claimed.           “Police have started a case against my client but the allegations didn’t come from victims.  A large number of people had greatly benefited from Shahed's action and he has many well-wishers,” Shahed's lawyer Moniruzzaman told the court.           But Public Prosecutor Abdullah Abu said Shahed has tarnished Bangladesh’s image on the world stage.          "Many Bangladesh expatriate workers were sent back by Italy due to the false COVID-19 test reports provided by his institution. Such a criminal should be given an exemplary punishment.”          The case against Shahed and his associates alleges that the hospital authorities duped nearly 6,000 patients out of Tk 20.1 million by issuing fake coronavirus tests reports even though it was supposed to provide free treatment for COVID-19. They later billed Tk 19.6 million to the health directorate.           Shahed has allegedly embezzled billions by defrauding ordinary people through his microcredit and MLM business, according to the Anti-Corruption Commission.

As others have noted, we’ve seen a similar pattern from Trudeau in previous scandals, involving his family holiday to the Aga Khan’s Caribbean island and the SNC Lavalin affair. Won’t he ever learn? they ask.          Of course, everyone has his blind spots, and for Trudeau family may be a big one. Given his privileged background, he may just see connections to the likes of WE and the rewards that come with them as just the natural order of things.

Financing of these subversive activities was taken care of by holding companies and donations from business people. Media houses were established to shape the public opinion and soon became the focal point of the actions taken against journalists, academics, bureaucrats and military officers who opposed or tried to expose the organization. They were lynched and purged. FETO also started meddling in business transactions and government tender processes. Laundering enormous sums of money, arranging illegal transfers of cash and other financial crimes became business as usual. FETO members infiltrating critical state posts abused their power to eliminate who opposed the organization, by illegal wiretapping, fabricating evidence, unlawful arrests, thereby intimidating and blackmailing a large segment of the society. The final straw was the coup attempt on July 15th 2016 and since then, Turkish government agencies have been struggling to decipher the dark sides of this cunning organization both in Turkey and in other countries where it still remains active.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in her dissent that "proceeding with Purkey's execution now, despite the grave questions and factual findings regarding his mental competency, casts a shroud of constitutional doubt over the most irrevocable of injuries." Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Elena Kagan, and Stephen Breyer joined her dissent. Lee had been strapped to the execution gurney for several hours while the high court weighed his appeal, and when the Supreme Court gave the green light, he was quickly injected with pentobarbital.

President Donald Trump has flatly rejected any notion of changing base names, and has defended the flying of the Confederate flag, saying it’s a freedom of speech issue. Esper spent last Friday with Trump in Florida, but it’s unclear if they talked about the flag ban.          The Marine Corps and U.S. commands in Korea and Japan have already banned display of the Confederate flag, saying it can inflame division and weaken unit cohesion. The Navy, Air Force and Army were all ready to do the same, but their progress was halted when Esper made it known he wanted to develop one consistent policy.           Some of the orders in Esper’s memo released Wednesday are already in effect by the military services, but his directive is a move to also make those policies more consistent.          For example, he ordered the military to no longer include photos of service members when they are being considered by a promotion board. This would mark a change for the Navy and Marine Corps. But, the Air Force removed photos from promotion boards more than a decade ago, and Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy announced last month that beginning in August his service would no longer include them.

The tipster did not wish to be identified and would not identify the victim.          “He just wanted to make us aware to prevent future incidents and raise awareness. Officers were dispatched to check the rail for any evidence of an attack but were unable to locate anything,” Bailey wrote. “Sgt. (David) Noyes, in the interest of public safety, continued to investigate, and was able to identify the victim of the alleged attack from a post to Amesbury Squawks by another Good Samaritan looking to raise awareness through Facebook.”          Detective Matthew Cunningham was assigned the case and spoke to the alleged victim, who later said he never wished for the incident to be reported to police.          “When the victim was asked about the incident, he stated ‘never happened.’ We respect the alleged victim’s right not to speak further on the matter, and without any other information the investigation has been closed. Officers have and will continue to patrol the Rail Trail to ensure it is safe for all citizens of Amesbury,” Bailey wrote in his statement.

          Throwing open the French doors of my guest room at Bernardus Lodge & Spa in Carmel Valley, California, and mid-sip from a glass of the resort's eponymous Sauvignon Blanc, I ruminated on the risks and rewards of travel during this unsettling time.           I was distracted for a moment, not only by the crisp and expressive Monterey County wine in my hand, but by a rabbit hopping among the lavender blooms just a few feet away. I rather envied this cotton-tailed cutie who appeared blissfully unaware of the travails of life during a pandemic.           This Forbes-rated, four-star open luxury resort was just three hours from my home in Napa Valley, for which I was grateful, as driving seems the safest option for a travel adventure now. With my four-legged travel companion, Freddie, in tow, and my next-door neighbor, Tara -- the two closest connections I've had for the past several months -- we hit the road, giddy at the prospect of a change of scenery.          Arriving at Bernardus, we were greeted by a masked bellman who explained where to park, since there would be no valet service on this visit. We were offered and accepted, however, assistance with our luggage. Check-in was swift, with a plexiglass partition at the front desk, social distancing in place and a reminder about mandatory mask-wearing on the property. All signed in, I availed myself a dollop of hand sanitizer from the bottle I spotted in front of me, available for guest use.          This resort has remained open for business throughout the pandemic, which means they've had plenty of time to adhere and adjust to California's health guidelines for guests. The lodge, in fact, was almost fully booked while I was there. Yet, there's plentiful open space on the property for guests to stroll, including an exquisite rose garden within which raised beds of organic produce are grown exclusively for use by Executive Chef Cal Stamenov and his sensory-stoking culinary offerings.           Everywhere I turn, lavender is in aromatic bloom, even between the purplish artichokes stretched skyward from Cal's garden. Notably, the rose garden is strategically sited so as to frame the view of Bernardus' estate vineyards, with its backdrop of the Santa Lucia Mountains.           Reservations are required for outdoor seating at the resort's Lucia Restaurant & Bar, and diners share a single-use paper menu at every meal.           Tara and I feel almost mischievous as we remove our face masks in order to eat, yet we were also conscious of the increased risk to the waitstaff. We accepted a pour of the sparkling rose we brought in celebration of our outing and gleefully toasted to a dinner we did not have to cook ourselves.          Only one thing could have made the experience feel more decadent -- to be seated at the Chef's Table within the kitchen where the walls are adorned with scratched signatures of various celebrities, including culinary great and native Californian Julia Child. That experience is not being offered until post-pandemic.          Honestly, it has been so long since I've been in a restaurant that I'd almost forgotten how much pleasure there is in dining out.           After that, I was primed for a hot, detoxifying salt bath in the luxuriously deep soaking tub in my room, followed by a nightcap while seated next to the in-room fireplace. Minutes later, I fell into a trance-like sleep.          The next day, Tara, Freddie and I got back in the car for a drive into the nearby village of Carmel. There, a full mile of artisan shops and more than 20 tasting rooms beckoned. But wait, many of those rooms were not open, thanks to COVID-19. So, our plan switched to a walk on the beach at Carmel-by-the-Sea.           Yikes! The temperature by the ocean was at least 20 degrees cooler than the valley, bringing on the shivers, so we hiked back uphill, donned our masks and power-shopped for a while. We grabbed a snack at an outdoor courtyard restaurant before retreating back to our secluded deck at the Lodge. That evening, takeout pizza from Lucia Restaurant seemed like the ideal solution for supper. We scarfed it down while polishing off the last of the Bernardus Sauvignon Blanc.           How did it feel to travel, sleep, shop and eat in the age of COVID-19? Truth be told, the adventure satiated my need to get out and feel normal, and I was grateful for the opportunity to do it, especially at such a lovely spot as Bernardus, but I could not shake a deep awareness of being \"on guard,\" never forgetting all of the extreme precautions that I -- and others employed in the hospitality industry -- took to make it happen. Odd and eerie at times? Yes. But worth it? Absolutely.          Charlene Peters travels the world to discover culinary dishes and worthy wines to share with readers.

“The idea of people willing to sacrifice themselves ... is pretty much expected in China,” said Yanzhong Huang, a global health expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, a U.S. nonprofit organization.
 But with corporate and government officials getting vaccinated, other employees “might feel pressure to participate. That would violate the voluntary principle” that is a bedrock of modern medical ethics, Huang said.
 The first round of human testing — a Phase 1 trial — requires permission from a country’s drug regulators, who decide whether there is enough laboratory and animal evidence to justify the attempt.
 SinoPharm, which declined to comment for this story, is testing two vaccine candidates that received government permission for Phase 1 trials in mid- to late April. In a post on its subsidiary’s official WeChat account, the company says it conducted its “pre-test” at the end of March “to make the vaccines hit the market as early as possible.”

Elsewhere during the medieval period, another Turkic plunderer, Babur the Mogul, invaded India in 1528 and destroyed Hinduism's most sacred place, the birthplace of Lord Rama. To add insult to injury, he built the infamous Babri Mosque, an act that became a source of conflict and recrimination for 500 years until in 2019 when the Indian Supreme Court, thanks to a Muslim archeologist, determined the Babri Mosque was built over the 'Ram Janambhumi' (where Lord Rama manifested himself in human form).

In April, the government awarded a $10.2 million contract to a TeleTracking Technologies, based in Pittsburgh. At the time, the company was hired to gather data on things that were already being reported to the CDC, such as available hospital beds.           TeleTracking has won 29 contracts for federal government work stretching back to 2004. None of its previous contracts paid more than $300,000. The prior contracts were for computer systems and programming at Veteran Affairs hospitals.

The Navy eliminated the photos in 2016, then added them back in 2018 after members of promotion boards complained. They said the photos aided their ability to assess a service member’s “ability to perform the duties of the next higher grade,” according to the 2018 memo. The Marines have always included photos.          Army officials last month said they were eliminating the photos because a study showed they could make a difference in some promotion boards. The study suggested that when the photo is not included, it took board members less time to vote, their scores were more closely aligned and “the outcomes for minorities and women improved.”          Esper’s memo, however, left other promotion board issues unresolved and subject to further review, including whether the services should redact the box on the form that identifies a person’s race or whether a person’s name — which in some cases could indicate race or gender — should also be removed.          He also ordered a review of hairstyle and grooming policies, which all the military services have done multiple times in recent years. They have all loosened restrictions, particularly on women’s hair, to allow for more ethnic hairstyles, including various braids and larger buns.

American employees affected by the furloughs/terminations work at Tech-Ops Tulsa, the airline's largest maintenance base, the APU (Auxiliary Power Unit) facility, Tulsa International Airport and the administration office, according to the letter.                          Tech Ops-Tulsa employs about 5,400. American declined a Tulsa World request to interview the director of the base.                          Under certain conditions, the WARN Act requires employers to give their workers 60 days notice before a plant closing or mass layoff. The criteria are complex but some basic levels are layoffs of 50 or more workers at a single site, where 50 is at least one-third of the total full-time workforce at that site, or any layoffs of 500 or more workers at a single site, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.

"From the time the CARES Act was signed in March, we had a stated goal of avoiding furloughs because we believed demand for air travel would steadily rebound by Oct. 1 as the impact of COVID-19 dissipated.                          “That unfortunately has not been the case."

But pushing markets lower has been the relentless rise of coronavirus counts across much of the United States, which threatens to undo all the improvements. California has already brought back orders for bars and other businesses to close due to a surge in cases, and the worry is other states will have to follow suit.

Defense Secretary Mark Esper took steps Wednesday to expand diversity within the military and reduce prejudice, but he skirted several major decisions, including whether to ban the Confederate flag at defense installations.          In a four-page memo, Esper ordered all military services to stop providing service members’ photos for promotion boards, directed a review of hairstyle and grooming policies, and called for improved training and data collection on diversity. Absent from the memo was any mention of the issues that have roiled the nation — efforts to ban the Confederate flag and a growing movement to remove Confederate statutes and rename military bases honoring Confederate leaders.          Confederate flags, monuments and military base names have become a national flashpoint in the weeks since the death of George Floyd. Protesters decrying racism have targeted Confederate monuments in multiple cities. Some state officials are considering taking them down, but they face vehement opposition in some areas.          A draft policy circulated by Pentagon leaders more than a week ago would have banned the display of the Confederate flag in Defense Department workplaces or public areas by service members and civilian personnel. It said a ban would preserve “the morale of our personnel, good order and discipline within the military ranks and unit cohesion.” That policy was never finalized or signed, and instead officials say it is now being revised.

“It’s very difficult to choke off oxygen in open deck spaces” and then to follow the flames into all the nooks on a craft, said maritime lawyer Rod Sullivan, who served in the Navy.           It’s not uncommon for ship fires to take days to extinguish, he added, pointing to a fire last month on a car-carrying cargo ship that burned for eight days in Jacksonville, Florida.           The difficulty was compounded aboard the Bonhomme Richard because it was undergoing maintenance and there was scaffolding, along with other equipment and debris in the way of firefighters. One of the ship’s fire suppression systems also was deactivated because of the maintenance project.           Retired Capt. Lawrence Brennan, a professor of international maritime law at Fordham University in New York, said even spraying water on a ship fire can be risky: If any aluminum on board melted on plywood the combination could create aluminum carbide, which, in turn, can generate a flammable methane when sprayed with water.

During a remand hearing on Thursday, Shahed broke down in tears as he spoke about the death of his father from COVID-19 while claiming to have been infected by the virus himself, according to a prosecutor.          Shahed’s father Sirajul Karim, who had tested positive for COVID-19, died while undergoing treatment at Universal Medical College Hospital Ltd in Dhaka’s Mohakhali on July 9.          Shahed, the chairman of Regent Group, had been on the run for about a week after it emerged that his hospitals swindled thousands of unsuspecting patients out of millions of takas on the pretext of coronavirus treatment.          The authorities sealed off the headquarters and two branches of Regent Hospital in Dhaka. It also initiated a case against 17 people, including Shahed, on charges of issuing fake COVID-19 test reports and other irregularities.          The Rapid Action Battalion arrested Shahed in a Satkhira village bordering India on Wednesday and airlifted him to Dhaka before handing him over to the police. He was subsequently produced in court alongside his close aide Masud Parvez, also the MD of Regent Hospital, on Thursday under tight security.

Then, the Thunder has a large contingent of young players who are not that far removed from playing on youth travel teams. They traveled in vans. They shared hotel rooms.           Some of those same players have also spent time playing in the NBA's G League. Players don't share rooms there, but luxuries are few.          Add in a guy like Paul, who is as consummate a pro athlete as you'll find, and it makes for a professional, positive bunch in the bubble.

The price of oil, which crashed below zero in April, has recovered some ground and was trading above $40 a barrel Wednesday. But that’s still below what many producers need to break even.                  The OPEC ministers also discussed the need for better compliance from some countries, such as Iraq and Nigeria, which have produced more oil than they were supposed to under past agreements. In recent months, compliance has improved, several ministers said.                  “Looking ahead, each of us now needs to double down on the unanimous decisions we have made,” Barkindo said. “We need to remember that strength, collaboration and positive outcomes come only through continuous effort and struggle from each and every participant.”                  ___

Walker, 19, and Rodgers, 18, face the death penalty or life in prison without the possibility of parole if convicted.            Jaquan Murphy, 21, was also arrested in connection to the incident last week. The complaint includes gang and gun allegations.            Captain Jonathan Tippet, who oversees the Los Angeles Police Department’s elite Robbery-Homicide Division, said three men and two teenage boys probably went to the home because they knew Pop Smoke was there from social media posts. They stole items from the home, though Mr Tippet said he could not divulge what was taken.            All five are believed to be members of a South Los Angeles gang, which Mr Tippet would not name, and at least some of them are believed to be linked to a 2019 homicide when a fight escalated into a shooting outside the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.            Authorities did not initially believe the rapper’s death was related to a robbery. The home where the shooting occurred is owned by Edwin Arroyave and his wife Teddi Mellencamp, a star of The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills and the daughter of Rock & Roll Hall of Fame star John Mellencamp.            Teddi Mellencamp previously said on Instagram that the couple had been notified of the shooting at their rental property but knew no more than what they had seen in media reports.            Pop Smoke arrived on the rap scene in 2018 and broke out with Welcome To The Party, a gangsta anthem with boasts about shootings, killings and drugs that became a huge sensation, and prompted Nicki Minaj to drop a verse on a remix.            Earlier this year, Pop Smoke released the mixtape Meet The Woo 2, which debuted at number seven on the Billboard Top 200 albums chart. It was the follow up to his first official release, Meet The Woo.            The rapper also had the popular hit Gatti with Travis Scott and Jackboys and Dior.            His major label debut album, Shoot For The Stars Aim For The Moon, was executive produced by 50 Cent. It was released posthumously on July 3 to mostly positive reviews and features appearances from artists including Future, DaBaby and Quavo.            Pop Smoke had been scheduled to start a US tour in Washington DC on March 2.

However, the virus rebounded with alarming speed and ferocity — forcing the state to pause or roll back many reopenings and pushing some areas to the brink of reimposing the sort of strict stay-at-home orders that, just weeks ago, seemed to be in the rearview mirror.                   L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti has warned that the city is inching closer to another shutdown as dangers posed by the coronavirus continue to loom.                  “We made so much progress in March and April,” he said Monday. “There is no question that the pandemic has gotten worse, here in L.A., across California and across this country. … We did the right thing before. And now we have to do the right thing again.”                  Amid the continuing surge, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Monday statewide restrictions Monday to again halt all indoor dining at restaurants and close bars, zoos and museums.

The closures Monday hit salons in the nation’s most populous state especially hard. The industry is filled with mom-and-pop shops and independent stylists — many still struggling after a monthslong shutdown that began in March. While restaurants and retail stores are encouraged to move outdoors and set up on sidewalks, regulators have barred salons from making the same move.                  Many salon owners feel like they’re being unfairly punished. Unlike at bars or restaurants, workers and customers at salons wear masks constantly and groups don’t typically gather there. They said they have ample training on sanitizing procedures and don’t understand why they’re lumped in with other businesses.                  “We were temperature checking, we were doing everything to the letter, no one was getting in without a mask,” said Ben Daidone, who closed his Santa Monica salon. “It reminds me of my grade school teacher punishing everybody for chewing gum when we couldn’t find out who the perpetrator was.”                  The strife comes as California grapples with a rise in coronavirus cases and hospitalizations following the state’s decision to let many businesses reopen and as people gather in warmer weather.
