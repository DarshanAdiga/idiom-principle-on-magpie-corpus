 For the second time in as many days, a former cornerstone member of the Jacksonville Jaguars is leaving the franchise, with the Jaguars making a somewhat shocking announcement Monday morning that they had waived running back Leonard Fournette.
 The Jaguars had trade discussions involving Fournette before the NFL Draft, but this move still comes as a shock considering the Jaguars are set to take the field against the Indianapolis Colts in 13 days for Week 1. Fournette had been the team's No. 1 running back through all of camp, so the fact that they cut him following the team's final scrimmage on Saturday is a head-scratcher.
 In three seasons, Fournette played in 36 regular season games and rushed 666 times for 2,631 yards (4.0 yards per carry) and 17 touchdowns, along with 134 receptions for 1,009 yards and two receiving touchdowns.
