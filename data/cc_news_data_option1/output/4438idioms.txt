If they say no, the old Confederate-themed flag will not return. Instead, a commission will design another new flag to go on the ballot in 2021. The new design would have the same rules: it must include "In God We Trust," and it cannot incorporate the Confederate battle emblem.

Although he played the full 90 minutes in the Reds' Champions League victory against Midtjylland in midweek, Shaqiri has been reduced to a limited role for Jurgen Klopp's men and he was happy to be back in the team against the Hammers.
 “It’s always nice to be involved. Obviously I was injured a few times and it was always the hard way for me until now," he told the _club's official website._
 "I’m very happy that I’ve got my minutes back, I’ve tried to stay fit and I hope it stays like this.”
 He continued: “It was unbelievable. Of course, the subs always try to change the game and try to decide the games.
 “And, of course, I’m a player and Diogo is also a player who can decide games and we needed that, so it was perfect.
 “We both [played a part] in the second goal. It was a nice one and an important one, so we are very happy the three points stay here at Anfield.”
 David Moyes' side gave the reigning Premier League champions a hard time at Anfield and the Switzerland international was relieved to get the three points.

You know those obnoxious sites that pop up dialogs when they think you're about to leave, asking you to subscribe to their email newsletter? Well that won't do for Scripting News readers who are a discerning lot, very loyal, but that wouldn't last long if I did rude stuff like that.

It's got everything from the previous day on Scripting, plus the contents of the linkblog and who knows what else we'll get in there. People really love it. I wish I had done it sooner. And every email has an unsub link so if you want to get out, you can, easily -- no questions asked, and no follow-ups. Go ahead and do it, you won't be sorry! :-)

“It was a tough game. We knew that West Ham would come here with a lot of confidence because they had good results against big teams in the past games," he said.
 “We saw that in the beginning and they went in front early but we kept going and [played] our game until the end. The football we played, we tried and at the end of the day it’s important to win the game and we did that.
 “You have to believe until the end and in the end we scored a nice goal and the second one was in the football rules, so we are very happy.”

The Gunners sealed all three points thanks to a goal from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who fired from the penalty spot to continue United's misery at Old Trafford this season.
 With the loss to Arsenal, United have won just two of their first six Premier League games as the club sit 15th in the table, with just seven points thus far.
 And Neville says that the midfield is a particular area of concern, as is the right wing due to the club's inability to sign Borussia Dortmund star Jadon Sancho this summer.
 "There are more problems than solutions," Neville told _Sky Sports._ "You have six midfield players at the club: Nemanja Matic, Fred, Scott McTominay, Bruno Fernandes, Donny van de Beek and Paul Pogba, and you've somehow got to get them into a system, which is forcing Ole to play a diamond.
 "I think there was an element today of him thinking he could just put four players in that diamond and it would work after what happened in midweek but McTominay on the right-hand side wasn't working after five minutes.
 "You have to be comfortable moving out into that wide area; [Aaron] Wan- Bissaka's already a bit awkward on the ball at right-back so you need someone to balance it and the balance on the right is a real problem for United.
