_Langrisser_ is a tried and true return to retro roots. This enjoyable remake is one that long-time fans of Warsong or those who have been interested in the series for a long time finally get the chance to play. While it lacks a tutorial, the mechanics are mostly easy to grasp with a little sleuthing around the menus to understand how everything works. The updated art style is wonderfully drawn, but the inclusion of the original art is what shines most with a wonderful early '90s nostalgic anime style. The story may not last on most memories, but the combat makes this a fun romp with a good amount of challenge. Any fan of tactics titles should absolutely consider diving into _Langrisser I & II_.

  In light of the pandemic concerns, Barkley suggesting the NCAA should cancel the men's and women's basketball tournaments is a significant response, as the former basketball star doesn't want more people risking their health.


  "I'm gonna say this and I'm probably gonna get in trouble because I work for Turner and March Madness and CBS ... Turner Sports and CBS need to close down March Madness, man," he said on the ESPN show _Get Up!_


  "Even if there's no fans in the stadium, you can't have these players breathing on each other for 2 weeks, even if they stay at a hotel, they're going to be at different cities around the country. I hate to say it and I probably shouldn't say it because I work for CBS, but I think we're gonna have to shut down March Madness until we know more."


  Barkley went on to say the players would be upset with the decision, but health comes first.


  "I know these kids want to play. Think about it, these kids are sweating, breathing, leaning on each other ... that's crazy! Even if you lose, you go back home, you don't know if you've got the virus for a week or two."

  It looks like the NCAA listened to Barkley as the league canceled the men's and women's tournaments on Thursday afternoon. Barkley's announcement of being self-quarantined comes one day after the NBA also announced the suspension of the 2020 season.


  Barkley played in the NBA from 1984-2000. In 1993, Barkley was named NBA MVP in his first season with the Phoenix Suns and was also named the 1991 NBA All- Star MVP as a member of the Philadelphia 76ers. He was named to the All-Star team 11-times in his career.

Coronavirus Update: Grand Princess Departure From Oakland Delayed; Frustrated Passengers Still On Board

My word for the year is “opportunity” and I try to recognize every opportunity I have, whether it is a good, bad, easy or a hard opportunity. I have been given these opportunities and I need to embrace each one.
 In the last couple of weeks, I have been “caught between a rock and a hard place” with picking up grandbabies because their parents are sick, to taking my aging parents to doctor appointments. While reaching into my glove compartment within my car, I would pick the parking pass that I would need that day. This is when I realized the opportunities I have during this season of my life.
 This rock and hard place is joyful yet hard at times. I love having the opportunity to be with my grandbabies at the drop of a hat and pick them up from school, love and spoil them and send them back home. On the other side, I am thankful to have the opportunity to be there when my parents need me to take them somewhere. We are blessed that their health has been as good as it has for so long, but it’s hard to see them struggle at times in these aging years.
 Along with this rock and hard place, I have also gotten to the age where I am visiting doctors more often now and must manage around that time as well. Therefore, as these opportunities to love and support my family arise, I will cherish each “parking pass” I get to display and hold close the special times of being caught between a rock and a hard place and the blessings I have for the opportunity to be right in the middle of the ones I love.

Milton's Curry College and Easton's Stonehill College are the latest local universities to suspend in-person lectures, opting instead for remote, virtual coursework in hopes of limiting spread of the coronavirus. The move comes as larger universities across the state continue to pull the plug on in-person classes.
 "We understand that these measures present significant challenges, especially for our students and their families. But by taking these steps, our intention is to do our utmost to preserve their health and safety," Curry College President Kenneth Quigley Jr. said in a statement Wednesday evening.
 College closures have been the latest major disruption to everyday life because of the rapidly spreading coronavirus, joining work-from-home orders from employers and the cancellation of large gatherings, including the St. Patrick's Day parade in Boston and Scituate and academic conferences across the country.
 Harvard University announced Tuesday it would be moving to online, remote classes to minimize the spread of the coronavirus. By Wednesday afternoon, UMass, MIT, Boston University, Northeastern University, Tufts University and Emerson College had followed suit.
 Curry College has extended spring break on its Milton and Plymouth campuses through March 22, and will begin offering online-only classes on March 23 "for as long as necessary or appropriate," the school's statement said.
 Students who live on campus will receive further information regarding residence halls, retrieval of essential belongings and specific information for international students. Decisions regarding larger events are pending, though all events through March 23 have been canceled.
 Late Wednesday evening, Stonehill College issued a statement announcing it would be starting remote instruction on Wednesday, March 18 through at least March 27. Residence halls will close for all students, with the exception of international students and athletes. Athletic events are expected to continue as scheduled.
 Bridgewater State University also announced Wednesday evening it will extend spring break through March 20, but that classes are expected to resume March 23, according to a statement. Residence halls will remain closed until then.
 "This extension will permit the university to complete our planning in the event BSU needs to move to an online format for conducting most of our classes, and to thoroughly clean all interior areas of the campus," reads the statement from university President Frederick W. Clark Jr.
 While Curry and Stonehill's announcements are similar to that of other universities, others on the South Shore have not yet made final decisions on whether they will be closing campus or moving to virtual classes.
 "We're keeping an eye on any large gatherings and moving to cancel some of those," Chris Walker, chief of staff for Mayor Thomas Koch, said of activities at Quincy College, which is run by the city.
 Walker said city officials have been in contact with building management to "exponentially increase" cleaning with disinfectant. As for a closure, Walker said the college would remain open for now.
 "They are keeping an eye on the situation as it progresses and they're in regular contact with us, the public health commissioner and community colleges across the state," Walker said. "We're not closing at this moment, but the situation is very fluid and it is certainly something that can change."
 Eastern Nazarene College in Quincy will also remain open until a final decision is announced later this week concerning course delivery, closings and campus residency, according to a spokesperson. Its emergency response team will continue to meet to evaluate the recent decisions made by other universities in the state.
 The college has already canceled large gatherings, such as the Festival of Life scheduled for March 13 through March 15, weekly chapel services and international travel. It has also increased sanitation of public areas on campus, officials say.
 Amid the college interruptions, some have been more extreme than others. Harvard ordered students to vacate their residences by March 15, leaving many students without notice to coordinate housing or travel arrangements. Students at Tufts University, both graduate and undergraduate, have until March 16 to vacate their housing.
 MIT is requiring its undergraduates to leave campus residences no later than noon March 17, with online instruction starting March 30. The university confirmed on Tuesday that a recruiter who had visited the university's school of management in late February had tested positive for COVID-19, but school officials determined the community was at low risk after speaking with those in contact with the person.
 All five University of Massachusetts campuses will shift to a virtual mode of instruction beginning March 16 and lasting through at least April 1. President Martin Meehan emphasized in a memo on Wednesday that UMass is not closing campuses and that each campus is examining strategies to accommodate students with housing needs.
 Boston University also decided to keep housing and dining halls open to students despite the cancellation of in-person classes, recognizing it might not be possible for all students to make other arrangements. Nevertheless, the school encourages students to go home or stay home and not return to campus until at least April 13 if possible.
 Northeastern took the same approach, permitting students to stay if they choose to maintain "continuity of campus life" once remote instruction begins Thursday.
 "As of today, we have no evidence that COVID-19 has infected a member of the Northeastern community," President Joseph Aoun said in a letter on Wednesday. "Nevertheless, we must focus on prevention, not just containment."
 The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the following to prevent illness and exposure to coronavirus: avoid close contact with people who are sick; avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth; stay home when sick; cover your cough and sneeze with a tissue; and wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol.      Anastasia E. Lennon can be reached at alennon@patriotledger.com.

 Anthony, New Mexico, is a mere crow's flight from El Paso, Texas, my point of origin. Anthony is where my group from the Society of American Travel Writers stopped to enjoy a meaty and chili-spice-centric luncheon on a ranch known for its pecan orchard. Our adventure was billed as Borderland Eats, with a first stop to Seco Spice to tour the chili pepper factory.   Capsaicin-rich chili peppers and similar spices like smoked paprika are prevalent indigenous ingredients in the cuisine of the Mexican border region but are used and enjoyed everywhere.   We took a van to Seco Spice, a large organic chili pepper producer and supplier. Before we left El Paso, Chef Oscar Herrera hopped aboard the van to share a bit of local background and history on our impending lunch.   Herrera's passion about cooking began at an early age, thanks to his family, and to Julia Child, whose TV cooking show he watched with awe. Herrera is best known for opening Flor de Nogal, a top-ranked restaurant in neighboring Juarez, Mexico, as well as Taft-Diaz in the Stanton House in El Paso.   Interestingly, Taft-Diaz restaurant is named after U.S. President William H. Taft and Mexican President Porfirio Diaz. Back in 1909, the two leaders met to resolve a dispute over a 600-acre plot of land called El Chamizal, which was created by a shift in the Rio Grande River near California, discovered by surveyors.   Chef intro and history lesson complete, face masks and hair nets were distributed to all of us as we arrived at Seco Spice -- before we stepped outside to be met by the olfactory punch of smoked chili pepper. This visit to a fourth-generation-owned chili pepper factory proved especially memorable to my sinuses, and I hadn't yet entered the building! Once inside, breathing was labored, even with the mask, but I was on a mission to see fresh paprika produced.   Agronomist and Harvest Manager Lucas Ogac explained that Seco's chili pepper smoking process takes place in nearby Chihuahua, Mexico, because there they're able to smoke using mesquite wood; in the U.S., paprika is often \"smoked\" using chemicals. So, the chili peppers are grown and harvested in New Mexico, shipped over the border for smoking, then returned to this New Mexico facility to be dried and ground.   The harvesting and sorting of the peppers is time-sensitive and laborious. The farm's laborers pick only from 6 to 9 a.m. and then call it a day, due to temperatures hovering around 100 degrees. Pickers are paid between 90 cents and $2 per bucket. Every four days, close to 1,000 pounds of peppers are bagged after they're picked, dehydrated and milled in steel vats. The spices are then packaged and sold to a variety of chain restaurants, including Taco Bell.   My sinuses were grateful to learn that green chilis, ghost peppers (deemed the deadliest peppers to digest) and habaneros were picked the week prior to our tour.   Watching paprika being produced made everyone in our group hungry for lunch. When we arrived at our lunch spot, however, a ranch a 10-minute drive away from the spice factory, we were put to task at an outdoor table to prepare the cactus salad and Hatch chile corn (off the cob) while Chef Herrera and his team smoked short ribs, sausages and a whole suckling pig to make carne asada.   We dutifully prepped, then toured the ranch, where horses and miniature ponies frolicked behind a posted fence. The ranch is surrounded by nine acres of orchard planted with pecan trees whose trunks are submerged in water as the method of irrigation. These trees produce up to 20,000 pounds of nuts annually, which are harvested in late December and sourced to Whole Foods Markets in El Paso and Albuquerque, some bakeries in Colorado and Utah, and as far north as Idaho.   By the time our tour concluded, lunch was finally ready and served family- style, accompanied by tumblers of margaritas. We dined with abandon, amazed by the flavors and by the culinary collaboration that brings these smoky spices across the borders of two countries and two states: Mexico and the U.S.; El Paso, Texas, and Anthony, New Mexico.

El diagnóstico final del presidente de Brasil, Jair Bolsonaro, resultó negativo por coronavirus, luego de que la primera prueba realizada al mandatario por personal de salud de ese país diese un resultado contrario al actual, informó inicialmente El Mundo de España. Este hecho se confirma luego de que ayer el jefe de prensa de la presidencia de Brasil fuese diagnosticado como portador del COVID-19, lo que motivó que Bolsonaro realice un pronunciamiento a través de sus redes sociales utilizando mascarilla. En dicho pronunciamiento, el mandatario brasileño advirtió que existen recomendaciones por parte de las autoridades sanitarias de “evitar las grandes concentraciones” a fin de contrarrestar el contagio del nuevo coronavirus. Sin embargo, días antes había adjetivado como una “fantasía” a la novel enfermedad, logrando así críticas de la oposición de su país. “Jamás podemos colocar en riesgo la salud de nuestra gente (...) Nuestra salud y la de nuestros familias deben ser preservada”, fue lo que aseguró Bolsonaro visiblemente afectado por la afección durante la emisión de su mensaje cotidiano de los jueves. Cabe mencionar que el mandatario brasileño sostuvo una reunión con Donald Trump, presidente de Estados Unidos, el pasado sábado 7 de marzo. En la que también participó el jefe de prensa de Bolsonaro, hoy en aislamiento tras ser diagnosticado por coronavirus.

"Coaching quite often is about asking questions and leading players to their own answers," Price said. "It's much different if you come in and tell someone how to be better. If you can lead them to their own answers, and they can take some ownership in the process, they can see the light through their own eyes. Creating a dialogue and having a relationship by give and take, back and forth is way better than being dictatorial."

Technical chart claims that Verastem, Inc. (VSTM) would settle between $2.13/share to $2.42/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $1.65 mark, then the market for Verastem, Inc. becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $1.46 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -0.6. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

Anthony, New Mexico, is a mere crow's flight from El Paso, Texas, my point of origin. Anthony is where my group from the Society of American Travel Writers stopped to enjoy a meaty and chili-spice-centric luncheon on a ranch known for its pecan orchard. Our adventure was billed as Borderland Eats, with a first stop to Seco Spice to tour the chili pepper factory.   Capsaicin-rich chili peppers and similar spices like smoked paprika are prevalent indigenous ingredients in the cuisine of the Mexican border region but are used and enjoyed everywhere.   We took a van to Seco Spice, a large organic chili pepper producer and supplier. Before we left El Paso, Chef Oscar Herrera hopped aboard the van to share a bit of local background and history on our impending lunch.   Herrera's passion about cooking began at an early age, thanks to his family, and to Julia Child, whose TV cooking show he watched with awe. Herrera is best known for opening Flor de Nogal, a top-ranked restaurant in neighboring Juarez, Mexico, as well as Taft-Diaz in the Stanton House in El Paso.   Interestingly, Taft-Diaz restaurant is named after U.S. President William H. Taft and Mexican President Porfirio Diaz. Back in 1909, the two leaders met to resolve a dispute over a 600-acre plot of land called El Chamizal, which was created by a shift in the Rio Grande River near California, discovered by surveyors.   Chef intro and history lesson complete, face masks and hair nets were distributed to all of us as we arrived at Seco Spice -- before we stepped outside to be met by the olfactory punch of smoked chili pepper. This visit to a fourth-generation-owned chili pepper factory proved especially memorable to my sinuses, and I hadn't yet entered the building! Once inside, breathing was labored, even with the mask, but I was on a mission to see fresh paprika produced.   Agronomist and Harvest Manager Lucas Ogac explained that Seco's chili pepper smoking process takes place in nearby Chihuahua, Mexico, because there they're able to smoke using mesquite wood; in the U.S., paprika is often "smoked" using chemicals. So, the chili peppers are grown and harvested in New Mexico, shipped over the border for smoking, then returned to this New Mexico facility to be dried and ground.   The harvesting and sorting of the peppers is time-sensitive and laborious. The farm's laborers pick only from 6 to 9 a.m. and then call it a day, due to temperatures hovering around 100 degrees. Pickers are paid between 90 cents and $2 per bucket. Every four days, close to 1,000 pounds of peppers are bagged after they're picked, dehydrated and milled in steel vats. The spices are then packaged and sold to a variety of chain restaurants, including Taco Bell.   My sinuses were grateful to learn that green chilis, ghost peppers (deemed the deadliest peppers to digest) and habaneros were picked the week prior to our tour.   Watching paprika being produced made everyone in our group hungry for lunch. When we arrived at our lunch spot, however, a ranch a 10-minute drive away from the spice factory, we were put to task at an outdoor table to prepare the cactus salad and Hatch chile corn (off the cob) while Chef Herrera and his team smoked short ribs, sausages and a whole suckling pig to make carne asada.   We dutifully prepped, then toured the ranch, where horses and miniature ponies frolicked behind a posted fence. The ranch is surrounded by nine acres of orchard planted with pecan trees whose trunks are submerged in water as the method of irrigation. These trees produce up to 20,000 pounds of nuts annually, which are harvested in late December and sourced to Whole Foods Markets in El Paso and Albuquerque, some bakeries in Colorado and Utah, and as far north as Idaho.   By the time our tour concluded, lunch was finally ready and served family- style, accompanied by tumblers of margaritas. We dined with abandon, amazed by the flavors and by the culinary collaboration that brings these smoky spices across the borders of two countries and two states: Mexico and the U.S.; El Paso, Texas, and Anthony, New Mexico.
