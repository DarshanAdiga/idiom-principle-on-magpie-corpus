Hayley Raso scored twice as Everton cruised to 6-0 win over Aston Villa to move top of the Women's Super League. The Australian netted her first goal for the club in the 21st minute, tapping in Claire Emslie's cross, before doubling the Blues' lead three minutes later following a gift from Villa goalkeeper Lisa Weiss. A short ball from Izzy Christiansen allowed Scottish striker Emslie to curl in a third in the 28th minute, with Valerie Gauvin getting herself on the scoresheet five minutes before half-time. Chantelle Boye- Hlorkah had an instant impact after coming off the bench, scoring the fifth goal in the 51st minute with what looked to be a cross to the back post, and Emslie grabbed her second of the game two minutes later to complete the rout. It was Everton's third consecutive win of the campaign, while Aston Villa have now conceded 11 goals across three games after slumping to a third straight defeat.

ROUND ROCK -- After watching nearly all of a four-touchdown lead evaporate, Round Rock had lost all momentum. But an unbelievable special teams play as time expired ensured that the Dragons would not lose the game. Ty Dillon blocked his third kick of the game, Zach White's 22-yard field goal try with two seconds left, to preserve an exhilarating 35-33 Dragons win over Belton on Friday.
   
 Dillon also got his hand on White's 26-yard field goal kick on the Tigers' opening drive to send it wide left. Midway through the third quarter as Belton was mounting a comeback, Dillon blocked White's extra point attempt to hold the score at 35-20. Trey McCarty recovered the blocked PAT and the blocked field goal at the end of the game to secure the victory.
   
 Round Rock (1-0) built their big lead with a 21-point first quarter outburst. Dragons quarterback Seth Ford scored on a 12-yard keeper to cap the Dragons' opening drive, and the defense stopped the Tigers on the Round Rock 39 as Luke Dodd's sacked Ruben Jimenez on fourth down. On the next snap, Ford flicked a pass in the right flat to Keyon Johnson, who zipped up the right sideline for a 61-yard scoring play. Israel Morgan rushed for a 16-yard touchdown late in the first quarter for a 21-0 Dragons lead.
   
 Morgan scored again from 20 yards out for a 28-0 advantage early in the second quarter, but from there Jimenez and Maurice Reed took control for Belton (0-2). Reed, who tallied 127 rushing and 61 receiving yards, rallied his team on the ensuing kickoff, starting left and then jetting up the middle of the field for an 85-yard touchdown on the return. Round Rock again pulled ahead by four scores when Ford and Morgan connected for a 33-yard touchdown toss, but the Tigers marched down the field before halftime, and Jimenez threw an 18-yard scoring strike to Bryan Henry to trim their deficit to 35-14 at the break.
   
 After trading punts, Belton was in business on Kanyn Utley's 15-yard touchdown pass from Jimenez. But Dillon rushed in from the right to block the extra point, with McCarty scooping up the loose ball. Reed had 16 carries for 98 yards in the second half, helping sustain drives as the Tigers scored again late in the third on a 13-yard pass from Jimenez to Wriley Madden for a 35-27 score.
   
 Round Rock reached the Belton 1-yard line but the Tigers held them out of the end zone to start the fourth quarter. A post pattern pass from Jimenez to Reed was on the money for a 54-yard score to pull Belton within 35-33 with 7:26 left to play. But Parker Kuhn and Carter Wagner flushed Jimenez to the right and his two-point pass attempt to Madden hit the ground. Round Rock picked up a Tigers fumble at the Belton 14 with four minutes left, but the Tigers stripped Ford at the 1-yard line for one last drive. Belton moved 97 yards to the Dragons' 2 before a fumbled snap pushed them back three yards. On the game-ending field goal try, Dillon sprinted in from the left and laid out as the kick ricocheted off his hands and over to McCarty to seal an exciting season-opening victory.

Many small business owners have had to learn several lessons over the last seven months, due to COVID-19 and the ever-changing economic conditions.
 As we all know, since March, many small businesses have had to temporarily close and then open in phases. Other small businesses have decided to close their businesses permanently. While others may not have had to close at all, due to the nature of the business.
 One thing in common for sure that all these small businesses and their owners’ have is that they all have had to adjust in one way or another. The adjustments small business owners have had to make to name a few, have been finding new ways to conduct business, implementing new policies, being flexible, working on a leaner budget, and most of all, adjusting to stay healthy.
 As a senior business adviser for the University of Houston-Victoria Small Business Development Center, I have seen the obstacles that small businesses are going through and facing each day. I have also worked with many small business owners to find ways to continue operations and stay in business, as well as making small business owners aware of the financial resources available, such as those provided through the Small Business Administration.
 With this being said, several lessons have been learned during this time in all our lives. Let’s discuss five of those lessons that small businesses have learned.
 One lesson learned for small business owners has been that they are capable of change and that they can get through it. Sometimes we resist change because change can be hard. But, one thing for sure is everyone has had to make changes in their lives and continue to be able to be flexible.
 That brings us to the second lesson learned, which has been learning to be flexible. Many small business owners have learned that some work can be done from home, that business could be conducted virtually, and allowing flexibility for employees.
 The third lesson learned by small business owners is that employees are a small business’s greatest asset. Through the last seven months, many small businesses have worked hard to keep their employees and make sure they stay employed.
 The fourth lesson learned has been operating on a much leaner budget than what they are used to operating on. Many small businesses have had to adjust, due to a reduction in revenues and changes caused by the pandemic.
 The fifth and final lesson many small business owners have learned is that things can change overnight and we should have a contingency plan in place. A contingency plan is a plan that you put together to deal with unforeseen circumstances and be able to deal with them swiftly.
 Other lessons could be listed, but these are five lessons that I believe needed to be highlighted. Small business owners are resilient and will continue fighting to keep their businesses going because for many, this is their livelihood and they know that they have many others that rely on them, as well.

On a trip back to rural Red River County where I grew up, I had an interesting conversation with a gentleman at a local cafe where a buddy and I were having breakfast.
   
 "You up here for a squirrel hunt?" quizzed one of the older gentlemen from my distant past. "Yessir," I replied. "It's been about 35 years since I hunted squirrels in my old stomping grounds." He smiled and informed me the woods are full of squirrels and he assured me that I would find the hunting much better than when I hunted here as a kid.
   
 Back in the sixties and early seventies, squirrels were considered a delicacy on the dinner table as well as a great game animal. They were hunted hard and I remember a squirrel hunt was considered successful when three of four busheytails were bagged.
   
 "Where you hunting?" he continued our conversation. "I have permission to hunt the patch of woods behind our old place, where I hunted squirrel as a kid." I replied. He and a couple of his cronies followed us out to our truck and took a look at my .25 caliber Condor air rifle by Airforce Airguns. He was shocked that the powerful airgun was fueled by 3,000 psi of compressed air; charged via an air tank and that it had plenty of "uumph" to knock a squirrel out of the highest Pin Oak tree!
   
 "In the seventies when deer became much more numerous, a lot of the old timers and almost all the younger generation abandoned their .22's and shotguns loaded with #4 shot that they used for squirrel hunting for scoped deer rifles.
   
 This very rural part of the state is ground zero for some of the very best squirrel hunting to be had and I was pleased to learn squirrel numbers were even more plentiful than when I was a kid.
   
 A couple of hours hunting the woods of my youth proved the old gentleman to be right on target. I "eased" along the same little creek and hunted the same pin oak flats that my footsteps had traversed many decades earlier. I quickly discovered that although the bushytails were much more numerous, my squirrel hunting skills had become a bit rusty. I was moving way too fast. When I slowed down and moved very slowly, stopping often for several minutes, keeping my eye on the treetops for shaking limbs and listening for the sound of a squirrel "cutting" a tree branch or claws on bark, I began to connect with a few squirrels, enough for that dinner of smothered squirrel, rice and gravy that I had been eagerly awaiting!
   
 To my way of thinking, if a young hunter can learn the stealthy ways necessary to "slip up" on and harvest squirrel, he or she is well on their way to learning the skills necessary to hunt bigger game. Most veteran squirrel hunters stay on the move when hunting but, they move very slowly. Through the years, I've found still hunting to be the most productive way of finding and getting within range of squirrels. When a prime area is spotted ahead, such as a grove of oaks or pecan trees, I usually ease just inside the trees and sit down with my back against a tree and set the woods become quite. If I don't see limbs shaking or actually spot a squirrel within about ten minutes, I move a few yards to a spot that gives a view of the woods ahead. If a squirrel or the movement of a squirrel is spotted ahead, it's sometime best to stalk ahead, moving very slowly, using trees to conceal your movement. Back in my early career, clothing for hunting squirrel consisted of blue jeans and a red and black flannel shirt but considering the keen eyesight of squirrels, I've learned that camo clothing does help.
   
 Fox squirrels can often be found not only in the oak "bottoms" such as pin oak flats but on edges where stands of hardwoods meet field edges. Later in the fall when the acorns are gone, I've had good success hunting fence rows with standing bois d' arc trees, squirrels love to "cut" horse apples which serve as a late fall and winter food supply. While red or fox squirrels prefer the higher elevations, gray of "cat" squirrels almost always are found along the creeks or drainages.
   
 If comparing squirrels to horses, the fox squirrel would be the docile workhorse, the cat squirrel the high strung racehorse. Cat squirrels are nervous little critters and seldom set still for more than a few seconds, that's what makes hunting then with a scoped rifle so challenging. When I was a boy, I did most of my "high ground" squirrel hunting with an iron sighted little single shot J.C. Higgins .22. I killed far more fox squirrels with my little rifle than I did gray squirrels. When I finally got that Mossberg bolt action .410 shotgun, I began spending more time in the "bottoms", hunting pin oak flats and along Pecan Bayou for the challenging cat squirrels. Many shots on cat squirrels are passed up by rifle hunters waiting for the critters to stop running but with a shotgun, it's much easier to bag a running bushytail. I do have friends that are devout rifle squirrel hunters; they simply will not go after their squirrels with a scattergun. They use the excuse that the shot messes up too much meat but in truth, I think it's the challenge of placing those tiny little bullets precisely in a target as small as a squirrel's head that causes them to accept the challenge of rifle hunting.
   
 As a veteran outdoors writer, I have the opportunity to hunt a good many ranches for whitetail deer and I've noticed that the many feeders set up for deer attract lots of squirrels. While the majority of ranch managers don't want squirrel hunters banging away around the feeders with shotguns or .22 rifles, I use an Airforce Condor SS .25 caliber air rifle with the company's new "sound reduction technology" that is an absolute "squirrel hammer"; it makes very little noise and is ideal for sniping squirrels around a feeder. I have introduces several of my friends that own hunting ranches to this method of squirrel control and many of them have learned those pesky little corn eating squirrels are some of best eating of small game. While they don't hunt squirrels the conventional way of stalking the hardwood bottoms like I grew up doing, some of them have become devout squirrel hunters hunting the bushytails much like they hunt deer, over a feeder! It's great off-season sport and also helps fill the freezer with more quality meat!

WARRENTON — Adam Wayne Fisher, 34, of Long Beach was arrested after a police pursuit by vehicle and on foot that ended when Fisher jumped from his car at the Astoria roundabout, ran away and became tangled in blackberry bushes.
 At 5:03 p.m. Oct. 1, "Warrenton Police officers were dispatched to Walmart in reference to a theft in progress inside the store where a male suspect was in the men’s apparel and possibly had a razor knife," Warrenton Police Chief Mathew Workman said in a Friday press release.
 Officers Robert Wirt and Madyson Hanna responded and witnessed a male suspect speeding away in a black 2003 Volkswagen Jetta. The officers pursued the Jetta northbound on U.S. Highway 101 towards Astoria at speeds between 50 and 63 mph.
 An Astoria Police officer set up spike strips by the round-about east of the New Youngs Bay Bridge and stopped traffic in the area, Workman said. The Jetta drove over the left side of the center island of the round-about, then grazed two vehicles as it entered the southbound traffic lanes, then drove onto the grass median that separates the south and northbound lanes. As the Jetta drove across the median the driver exited the moving vehicle and began to run east, leaving the Jetta rolling on its own. The Jetta crossed the northbound lanes and became high-centered on a curb.
 Wirt and Hanna stopped and pursued the driver on foot for a short distance where he entered blackberry bushes, stopped and surrendered.
 Fisher was identified and taken to Columbia Memorial Hospital Emergency Department to obtain a medical release as a precaution due to airbag deployment in his vehicle and running into the blackberry bushes. Wirt was later treated at the emergency department for a minor injury to his knee suffered during a fall in the short foot chase.
 Fisher was taken to Clatsop County Jail and held on two charges of reckless endangering, attempting to elude police, two charges of hit and run, reckless driving, Third-degree robbery, second and third-degree theft, third-degree criminal mischief and third-degree theft. He was no longer in jail on Saturday morning.
 In 2007, Fisher was arrested on a charge of reckless driving in Pacific County, later pleaded down to second-degree negligent driving. He was charged with third-degree malicious mischief in 2013, but it is unclear from Chinook Observer files how this case ended.

Courtney Costa admits she has a love-hate relationship with softball.
 A sport she dedicated so much of her life time is now a bore for the 41-year- old to watch.
 "When I played, I thought it was the greatest sport ever," said the 1997 Dartmouth High graduate. "It's funny because as I grew up, softball and baseball became tedious to watch. I feel so bad for making my parents (Ray and Gerry) have to watch it so much."
 But watching Costa play softball -- or any sport for that matter -- was anything but boring.
 Her competitive spirit, which was ingrained in her early by her father, Ray Costa, led her to have a Hall of Fame career at Dartmouth High, starring in volleyball, basketball and softball. She was a three-sport captain her senior year and was named Dartmouth's Athlete For All Seasons and Female Athlete of the Year.
 "I've just always been really athletic," Costa said. "I'm pretty good at most sports. I wouldn't say I'm a rock star at all of them, but I can compete."
 Costa started playing youth softball around age 7 so when she got to Dartmouth High, she made varsity right away and was a four-year starter at shortstop.
 "I wasn't intimated at all," she said. "That was one of the biggest lessons my father taught me growing up -- you earn your spot. If you're good enough, you play. That's the attitude he had and I had."
 While the Indians struggled to win many games, Costa enjoyed a remarkable softball career, leading Dartmouth in doubles, triples, RBI and batting average (.321) her senior year to be invited to play in the Shriners' All-Star Game that featured the top seniors from every league and conference in the state.
 "We weren't that good. It was frustrating for me because I'm such a competitor," said Costa, who also played club softball for the New Bedford Police. "My club team traveled all over the country and played some tough competition. It gave me my fix of competitive softball."
 Costa's fondest team memories from Dartmouth High came in volleyball, a sport she only began playing in the ninth grade.
 "Volleyball became the love of my life," said Costa, who made varsity as a sophomore. "I loved the quickness of the game."
 The 5-foot-3 Costa reached amazing heights as an outside hitter, finishing her career as a three-time Eastern Athletic Conference All-Star.
 "I was playing on the weekends," she said of the extra work she put in. "I was playing beach volleyball in the summer.
 "We were good. We were like the equivalent to the Celtics, a bunch of really scrappy players. We just meshed as a team. No one was tall or intimidating. It was literally a bunch of athletes that loved the sport. My senior year was just the best ever."
 Relying on her 36-inch vertical, Costa recorded a team-high 101 kills in 1996 to lead the Indians to the Div. 1 South Sectional final, where they lost to Barnstable. She also led the team in spikes (517), and finished third in both serving percentage (90.8) and aces (18).
 "The reason I loved my volleyball team so much was that I felt everybody wanted to be there and enjoyed being there," Costa said. "High school sports, not everyone is looking to go to the next level. Some of them are there because their parents make them, some are there for something to do and some are going to go on and play at the next level."
 A three-sport athlete who also played basketball at Dartmouth, Costa attracted interest from a variety of Division I and Division II colleges for softball. She ultimately went with Division II Merrimack College.
 "At the time it was a really high D-2 school," she said. "It was the fact that I could play on a team that went to Nationals on a regular basis."
 In fact, the Warriors made five trips to the NCAA Tournament and reached the College World Series three times during Costa's five years with the program.
 "We never won it," she said. "We always came up short, but we were the queens of the campus. We were treated really well and got everything we wanted. It was crazy.
 "It was different being on a team that was competing every year."
 Costa's fondest memory was hitting a home run against Lewis University in May 2000.
 "Hitting a home run in nationals; that was a highlight," said Costa, who switched from shortstop to center field and saw some playing time as a freshman.
 By her sophomore year, she was starting in center field.
 "I had never played it before, but I loved it," she said. "I loved catching fly balls. You're the boss and you're able to run all over the place. I caught a few in my time when I dove over the fence. That was always amazing."
 Costa tore her ACL and MCL her junior year and had to sit out the season.
 "I never got injured in my entire athletic career until I got to Merrimack and I broke my middle finger my freshman year and I injured my knee my junior year," she said. "That was a lot of fun."
 Costa worked hard through physical therapy and was ready to go for fall ball.
 "My surgically-repaired knee is stronger than my other knee even to this day," she said.
 Costa was named a Northeast-10 Conference All-Star in back-to-back years to wrap up her career.
 "It was always a dream," she said of playing in college. "Playing a sport and being on a team that was as good as my team was it really teaches you how to be an adult. I spent five years getting up at 5 a.m. every morning. It's a different experience than your typical college experience. It was twice a day and it was always something.
 "It was worth it. I don't regret it. Playing a sport was the best years of my life -- from the time I was a small child until it was over."
 Costa graduated from Merrimack in 2002 with a degree in psychology and English. That marked the end of her days playing competitive softball.
 "I had played for so long," she said. "My college team was so good. It was very intense, it was a very intense five years. I played all through the summer in middle school and high school. It was non-stop all the time. I loved it. At the time it made me happy, but it had run its course."
 Costa played a few years of indoor recreational soccer, but gave it up to focus on her career as a teacher. She started teaching kindergarten in New Bedford soon after college and then went to Bourne, where she has been the last 16 years.
 For eight years she taught Spanish before teaching writing for the next six.
 "I saw all the classes in the school," she said. "I was a special area teacher for years and I loved it. I always said I want to try and be a classroom teacher and here we are. I love it."
 Costa is now in her second year teaching fourth grade at Bourne Intermediate School.
 "I loved knowing all of the kids in the school and having a different class every 45 minutes, but I also love having that one group of kids that are mine," Costa said. "They are like your family."
 Costa said she was sad when she had to say good-bye to her class back in March at the start of the pandemic.
 "It was my first year as a classroom teacher and I adored my class," she said. "It's not an ideal situation but we're trying to make it as best as we can."
 Costa has enjoyed the extra time at home in Dartmouth with her wife, Brittany Costa, and their son, Elliott, 3, as well as their newborn daughter, Estelle, who is two months old.
 "I carried Elliott and Brittany carried Estelle so we both got the experience," said Costa, who is currently on maternity leave. "Elliott is awesome but he's very active. He doesn't stop. It's tough having two, especially two that are so young and they require so much attention, but we're making the most of our time together."

That is LeBron's candidacy in a nutshell. Davis has the edge in raw numbers right now, but when you start to consider where those numbers come from and what they're actually saying, it's hard to deny that LeBron does more to help Davis generate those numbers than Davis does for him. This is usually the case when evaluating primary ball-handlers against big men. While the two obviously work in tandem, it's just easier for the guy who has the ball all of the time to impact a game than the guy who needs to get an entry pass first.

Rock Bridge was outgunned in last week's battle of undefeated teams in Jefferson City against Helias, as the Crusaders showed why they are the class of the newly formed Central Missouri Activities Conference.
   
 Rock Bridge head coach Van Vanatta harped on careless defensive mistakes during the 56-24 loss a week ago, but there was reason to turn the page -- and fast.
   
 Vanatta and his team would have another chance at a statement win one week later.
   
 Friday night's matchup against Class 6 No. 1 Liberty represented more than an opportunity to rebound from the lopsided loss to the Crusaders. The Blue Jays entered on top of the Class 6 District 4 standings, and district seeding was on the line.
   
 Liberty, however, crushed the Bruins' upset attempt from the start. Junior wide receiver Caden Dennis returned the opening kickoff nearly 90 yards for a touchdown.
   
 The unbeaten Blue Jays never trailed in a 52-28 victory over Rock Bridge, as junior running back Wentric Williams III ran all over the Bruins defense to the tune of nearly 250 rushing yards and four touchdowns.
   
 "They are ranked No. 1 for a reason," Vanatta said after the loss.
   
 Liberty didn't look back after Dennis' return. The Blue Jays jumped out to a 28-0 lead with 9:55 left in the second quarter. Williams III had two rushing touchdowns, then Rock Bridge senior Marquis McCaster fumbled on a kickoff return down 21-0 and junior linebacker Hunter Biesemeyer scooped up the loss ball for a touchdown.
   
 Mistakes placed the Bruins in a four-touchdown deficit in the blink of an eye.
   
 Vanatta gathered his entire team together near the 50-yard line, practically screaming for his players to circle around him. He implored them to wake up. The past two weeks were marred by lackluster energy in the first quarter.
   
 "It was both sides of the ball," Vanatta said. "We weren't moving the ball, giving up big plays (on defense) and special teams were killing us."
   
 Quarterback Nathan Dent tried his best to keep Rock Bridge in it. The Bruins finished the first half on a 14-0 run behind two rushing touchdowns from the junior signal caller.
   
 Rock Bridge couldn't stay out of its own way, however. Senior running back Bryce Jackson fumbled on the opening possession of the second half, followed by another score from Williams III.
   
 The Bruins were dominated in the trenches as the Liberty offensive line had its way.
   
 "We're built around that O-line and I felt like our running backs were running really hard," said Blue Jays head coach Chad Frigon. "Our starting quarterback (Luke Smith) didn't play tonight and so we knew we were going to have to lean on them."
   
 Backup quarterback Tyler Lininger slid into a starting role and went 3 of 6 passing with 66 passing yards.
   
 Vanatta was pleased with the way his offense -- which has scored 24 and 28 points in the past two weeks, respectively -- moved the ball. Costly turnovers, however, aren't something the Bruins can overcome, especially with newfound special teams issues.
   
 "We've got problems," Vanatta said about his team's performance on special teams. "We're going to fix it. … We're going to put some of our better guys on it."
   
 After the game, Vanatta provided some perspective. His Bruins are 4-2 and 3-1 in the CMAC with losses against the No. 1-ranked teams in Class 4 and Class 6.
   
 "Don't let (this season) fall apart," he pleaded with his players in the postgame huddle.
   
 The next two weeks could quickly change Rock Bridge's fortunes. Back-to-back rivalry games are coming up for the Bruins. First comes a crosstown trip to Battle (3-1, 1-1) next Friday, followed by a matchup against Hickman (2-3, 2-2) on Oct. 16.

“It is important to underscore that COVID 19 can take up to 14 days after exposure to the virus for symptoms to appear. During this time, the virus can easily spread to others. This means that decisions made today affect families, friends and communities for weeks to come,” the release said. Because of these growing numbers, preventative measures that help stop the spread are of upmost importance. First, limit your physical contact with others. A good rule of thumb is to limit your social circle to your household members and any essential supports, like childcare help. Every person that we come into contact with increases the chances of transmission. All efforts to reduce encounters with others make a difference. Remember to not to let your guard down when in public, even if you see someone you know. “Additionally, it’s critical to consistently wear a mask or face covering properly when in public or around those at risk, especially when it is hard to maintain a physical distance. Without knowing, anyone can spread COVID-19 by coughing or sneezing, talking, hugging, or even singing. When you wear a mask that covers your mouth and nose, you’re helping to protect yourself and those around you.” As the weather gets colder, we are going to begin facing colds and the seasonal flu. It can be difficult to distinguish between the symptoms of a cold, influenza, and COVID-19. However, the preventative measures taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 are also effective at limiting the spread of influenza. The annual flu vaccine is the most effective way to prevent the flu and flu-related complications. The trend in new cases of COVID-19 we are seeing in Indigenous communities is similar to the one seen in the general population and everyone is urged to help change the trend by making wise decisions, and following recommended public health measures.

 ROUND ROCK -- After watching nearly all of a four-touchdown lead evaporate, Round Rock had lost all momentum. But an unbelievable special-teams play as time expired ensured that the Dragons would not lose the game.
 Round Rock's Ty Dillon blocked a 22-yard field-goal attempt by Belton's Zach White with two seconds left on the clock to preserve an exhilarating 35-33 Dragons win Friday at Dragon Stadium.
 The dramatic block was Dillon's third and final one of Round Rock's season- opener. Dillon also got his hand on White's 26-yard field goal kick on the Tigers' opening drive to send it wide left. Midway through the third quarter as Belton was mounting a comeback, Dillon blocked White's extra-point attempt to hold the score at 35-20. Trey McCarty recovered the blocked PAT and the blocked field goal at the end of the game to secure the victory.
 Round Rock (1-0) built its big lead with a 21-point first quarter outburst. Quarterback Seth Ford scored on a 12-yard keeper to cap the Dragons' opening drive, and the defense stopped the Tigers on the Round Rock 39-yard line as Luke Dodd sacked Ruben Jimenez on fourth down. On the next snap, Ford flicked a pass in the right flat to Keyon Johnson, who zipped up the right sideline for a 61-yard scoring play. Israel Morgan rushed for a 16-yard touchdown late in the first quarter for a 21-0 Dragons lead.
 Morgan scored again from 20 yards out for a 28-0 advantage early in the second quarter, but from there Jimenez and Maurice Reed took control for Belton (0-2). Reed, who tallied 127 rushing and 61 receiving yards, rallied his team on the ensuing kickoff, starting left and then jetting up the middle of the field for an 85-yard touchdown on the return. Round Rock again pulled ahead by four scores when Ford and Morgan connected for a 33-yard touchdown toss, but the Tigers marched down the field before halftime, and Jimenez threw an 18-yard scoring strike to Bryan Henry to trim the Tigers' deficit to 35-14 at the break.
 After trading punts, Belton was in business on Kanyn Utley's 15-yard touchdown pass from Jimenez. But Dillon rushed in from the right to block the extra point, with McCarty scooping up the loose ball. Reed had 16 carries for 98 yards in the second half, helping sustain drives as the Tigers scored again late in the third on a 13-yard pass from Jimenez to Wriley Madden for a 35-27 score.
 Round Rock reached the Belton 1-yard line early in the fourth quarter but couldn't reach paydirt. A post pattern pass from Jimenez to Reed was on the money for a 54-yard score to pull Belton within 35-33 with 7 minutes, 26 seconds left to play. But Parker Kuhn and Carter Wagner flushed Jimenez to the right, and his 2-point pass attempt to Madden hit the ground.
 Round Rock picked up a Tigers fumble at the Belton 14-yard line with four minutes left, but the Tigers stripped Ford at the 1-yard line to secure one last possession. Belton moved 97 yards to the Dragons' 2-yard line before a fumbled snap pushed them back three yards. On the game-ending field goal try, Dillon sprinted in from the left and laid out as the kick ricocheted off his hands and over to McCarty to seal an exciting season-opening victory.

“I am expecting to have more customers, and Saturday and Sunday to be even better,” Halabi said. “It is a good start and we are excited to see how it will go. We want people to try our own line of wines because they are so good and so different from all of the others.”
 This year is the first time participants will travel to each business as part of the trail.
 Halabi — who also operates Lily’s Cakes in Harker Heights — said she was excited to be a part of the trail with this year being her first in business. She hoped the event would help bring in more locals to find out about the inn.
 Participants going to the winery will have access to a $10 wine sampling, with a variety of different wines to choose from.
 Wines at the inn will include both those from the winery, which Halabi said she is recommending to customers, to those from other wineries around the area.
 Stephen Springer, owner of Axis Winery, said visitors coming as part of the event will have access to four tastings from any of the business’s wines. This will also include its new seasonal sparkling CranApple sweet wine.
 While Springer said he had only one couple come in as part of the trail the first day, he felt the event would bring in more people as it went on.
 “I think it (the trail) is great,” Springer said. “It gets people out and it gets them to see your business front.”
 Alyssa Rogers, farm store manager for Dancing Bee Winery, said the winery will also have its seasonal mead, Mulled Harvest, available for participants of the event to taste.
 “We haven’t had anything (created) specifically for the trail, but we do have some new things coming out,” Rogers said. “We are hopeful, and it certainly is lovely weather outside and that usually brings more people out.”
 The Dancing Bee Winery, 8060 E. U.S. Highway 190 in Rogers, will offer attendees three tastings of its selection of meads and wines, along with a 10 percent discount on bottles of the wine.
 Many restaurants in downtown Temple will also be participating by offering a variety of deals on appetizers, desserts or wines.
 Benny Ismaili, owner of Benny’s Ristorante Italiano, said he hopes the event will help bring back customers that have stayed at home during the coronavirus pandemic. He said he also wanted to participate in the trail to help other local businesses in Temple.
 Ismaili’s restaurant, 17 S. Main St., will be offering participants in the trail a 50 percent discount on an appetizer.
 In addition to the benefits from the businesses, those who visit all the businesses that are participating in the trail will get 10 raffle tickets to win a wine refrigerator and Central Texas wine from the Chamber. The raffle is part of a donation by Sam’s Club in Temple.
 Those who don’t complete the trail will also be able to purchase tickets from the Chamber, with the drawing being held on Oct. 14.
 Rod Henry, president and chief executive officer of the Temple Chamber of Commerce, said the event has already seen about 260 tickets sold.
 Registration for the event costs $20 per ticket, with attendees able to bring their receipt to any of the participating locations, or the Chamber office at 201 Santa Fe Way, Suite 105, to get their physical ticket.
 Residents also may buy their tickets through Central Texas Tickets at https://bit.ly/3kR7h2O.

Alexander Holstein 10/03/2020 Alexander Holstein died peacefully at his home on Saturday, October 3, 2020 in his 96th year. A former industrialist in Syracuse, NY, Alex was at the forefront of the civic, cultural, educational, and religious affairs of Central New York, our state, and our nation. Alex was Vice President of Operations at SYROCO, a company founded by his grandfather in 1890. He graduated from the College of Engineering at Syracuse University and received his Masters degree from the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry. Alex met his wife, Chuckie, on a blind date in 1941. They married in 1946 and have been together for 79 years. Alex came from a family of civic entrepreneurs. He was a third-generation philanthropist in the Syracuse community. His grandfather, Adolph Holstein, was one of the founders of the Central New York Community Foundation, the United Way of Central New York (formerly the Community Chest), Bradley Brook Camp for children, and the Syracuse Jewish Federation. His father carried on the family tradition of involvement in the civic, cultural, and religious affairs of our community, and Alex continued the family tradition. As a strong supporter of quality health care for all, Alex served on the board of Crouse Irving Memorial Hospital for 25 years and later the Crouse Health Foundation. He was a Director of the Hospital Association of New York State (HANYS), chair of the NYS Hospital Trustees Advisory Board, and the National Congress of Hospital Governing Boards. His involvements in the religious community have been many. He is the founder and first Chair of the Jewish Community Foundation of Central New York, created in 2001 to serve local Jewish agencies and synagogues. He was a member of the Syracuse Jewish Federation Board of Directors, campaign chair, and served on the board of the Interreligious Council of Central New York (Interfaith Works) where he helped to create its Foundation. He, along with Chuckie, received the 2001 Interreligious Council's Leadership Award for "Devotion to Diversity, Distinction in Service, and Dedication to Community". He was a member of Temple Concord and served on the Board of Trustees, where four generations of the Holstein family have been involved in leadership positions. He was active in the American Jewish Committee and served as President of its local chapter and on its national board for several years. Alex's community activities have been broadly based. For his dedicated service to his community in 2003 he received the distinguished Syracuse Post Standard Achievement Award. He was an active member of the Central New York Community Foundation where he was one of the founders of the Neighborhood Leadership Program. At the Everson Museum he served as Chairperson of the Board shortly after the I. M. Pei facility was built. He hosted Yoko Ono and John Lennon when they spent time in Syracuse for Yoko's art show. For several years he was a member of the boards of the Urban League and Dunbar Center. During his chairmanship of the Dunbar Center Board, he was instrumental in the fund-raising, design, and construction of the current facility. He was very honored when an African American youth athletic organization, the Salt City Classics, presented him with their "Humanitarian Award". Education of his children and grandchildren was very important to Alex, who also served on the board of trustees of Manlius Pebble Hill School and chaired the board for three years. As a citizen trustee, he helped better the place where we live by participation and leadership on civic boards. He was the first chair of the Onondaga County Industrial Development Agency (OCIDA), a commissioner of the City of Syracuse Charter Revision Commission, City of Syracuse Community Renewal Policy Committee and Chair of the Economic Base Committee, and Vice-Chair of the Syracuse Urban Arts Commission. In support of economic development, Alex was Vice-President of the Greater Syracuse Chamber of Commerce, director of the Marine Midland Bank (HSBC), and director of the investment firm, Alliance Capital Management Corporation. His personal philosophy that peace among peoples and nations is possible through dialogue motivated him to be one of the founders of an early interfaith dialogue group seeking peace in the Middle East. Later, he became an active participant in SAMED (Syracuse Area Middle East Dialogue), a unique group that includes Muslims, Jews, and Christians who for many years have worked together to identify the paths towards peace. He also participated in the Interreligious Council's Dialogue on Racism. Alex was a caring, loving, and all-around great guy. He adored his children, grandchildren, and great- grandchildren. Precious to him were the international trips that he and Chuckie treated their grandchildren to for their bar and bat mitzvahs. Alex is survived by his wife, Charlotte (Chuckie) Holstein, their children, Carol Killian (Ron), David Holstein (Jeanne), Elizabeth Holstein, his daughter-in- law Alyse Holstein, and his eight grandchildren and seven great grandchildren. Alex was predeceased by his son, Philip Holstein (Alyse) and his daughter-in- law, Barbara Holstein (David). Services will be private but will be live streamed on the Sisskind Funeral Service Facebook page beginning at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday, October 6. Contributions may be made to Temple Concord, the Jewish Community Foundation of Central New York, the Everson Museum and Manlius Pebble Hill School.

I was disappointed to read derogatory remarks concerning Southern Software. This company is of the highest integrity, with customer satisfaction of utmost importance to them. They do their work “as unto The Lord,” which means they are trying to please Jesus.
 I know this company seeks excellence in all that they do. The right thing for the Carthage Police Department to have done would have been to request an in- person meeting with Ms. Meggs first, before addressing the Carthage Board of Commissioners. The company cannot fix a problem if they are unaware of it.
 I respect that Ms. Meggs would not elaborate on what the problem was because of her integrity and as a woman of God. She did not wish to demean those that spoke out and would not comment on things that were not stated in this article.
 All concerned citizens want the very best for officers. They put their lives on the line every day they are on duty. We want them protected and to have the very best in equipment that they need. I am sure that Southern Software would have gone out of their way to remedy whatever the problem(s) may have been, if they had only known.

J.J. Taylor sat in front of his locker just moments before the biggest game of his life. Quiet, he was staring at the silver helmet in his hands. Taylor wasn't looking at the Patriots decal or the red face mask, or thinking about making his NFL debut.
   
 Instead, his focus was the name on the back of the helmet. In all caps, it reads, "TANK GOODMAN."
   
 The name means everything. It elicits every emotion. It reminds him of the best times. And the pain, loss and heartbreak.
   
 "Before the game, I'd probably spend about five to 10 minutes just looking at the back of my helmet," Taylor said. "Just reminiscing."
   
 This season, several players have names on the backs of their helmets as part of the NFL's Say Their Stories initiative. They're doing it to honor victims of systemic racism and police brutality, as well as social justice heroes.
   
 But Taylor took it in a different direction to honor his longtime friend.
   
 Goodman was killed this summer in an act of gun violence. He was 23 and one of Taylor's closest friends. That's whom Taylor's thinking about before each NFL game. It's the name on his mind when he first runs on the field and the person he prays for before each kickoff.
   
 "Right now, with everything going on and just knowing how much he meant to me as a friend, it means a lot," Taylor said. "It means the world."
   
 A 5-foot-6 undrafted rookie free agent, Taylor is already an inspiration for making the team's roster. What people don't see is the pain he's dealing with or the motivation behind it all.
   
 Taylor entered his first NFL training camp in mourning. He now carries his friend's name with him every Sunday.
   
 "It was hard," the young running back said. "Now, I'm not just doing it for me anymore. I wasn't doing it for me in the first place. It was for my family, those who believed in me or those who looked up to me, but now I'm doing it for him -- to keep his legacy going."
   
 An early bond
   
 Jamal "Tank" Goodman was always stocky for his age. He always loved football. That's why the nickname "Tank" was fitting.
   
 The first time Jea Reese heard it was when she dropped her son off at his first football practice at Centennial High School in Corona, California. Players were running the 40-yard dash, and when he took off, a coach yelled, "Where did this tank come from?"
   
 The name stuck.
   
 A quiet kid, Goodman stood 5-8 and weighed upwards of 230 pounds as a teenager. On the field, he developed into a competitive, hard-hitting linebacker.
   
 "Oh, he loved football. He played from the time he was 9," said Reese. "He just really, really took to it. It even provided him a scholarship at Dixie State. He really enjoyed it. He actually went into Centennial as a running back, but they needed a linebacker. He had really not played defense, but he was athletic and ended up thriving."
   
 Goodman wasn't the next star running back. Instead, it was his friend, Taylor -- a 160-pound dynamo. Taylor entered Centennial as a sophomore and was a year behind Goodman.
   
 "It was a bond instantly," said Centennial coach Matt Logan. "They all played for similar previous coaches and played against each other. They're all really the type of comical type kids who would bag on each other, have fun. It was a close-knit group."
   
 In 2015, Goodman made first-team All-State as a linebacker and Taylor did the same as a running back. The pair bonded in part because of football, but they were also alike. Off the field, they were quiet but on the field, their actions spoke volumes.
   
 "[Jamal] would always talk about how good J.J. was and said he's just really quiet. As they got older, I told J.J., I could see the reason why he and my son developed the friendship, because my son was very quiet," Reese said. "They were very similar in that kids that have talent, just remarkable talent, but just we're not the showboaters.
   
 "They enjoyed the sport and enjoyed playing it. … They were very competitive on the field, but came off the field as gentle, caring people."
   
 Tragedy strikes
   
 Goodman ended up at Dixie State University in Utah because of football, but his goal was to make an impact off the field. He was in the process of completing a bachelor of science degree in criminal justice when his life came to a tragic end on June 23.
   
 That night, his roommate, Tommy Bradshaw Jr., admitted to police that he shot Goodman in the chest. This allegedly happened because Goodman knocked loudly on Bradshaw's bedroom door, according to court documents. Bradshaw, 32, was arrested and charged with one count of first-degree felony murder.
   
 At the time, Goodman was working with youths at a juvenile detention center and he wanted to make a difference after earning his degree. His mother said he was living with Bradshaw to help him.
   
 The nickname "Tank" was appropriate, due to his stature, but not an indication of who he was.
   
 "He was funny, he was goofy. Some will call him a big ole teddy bear," Taylor said. "He got the name Tank because he's a big dude, but he was a real good dude at heart and just a real genuine person."
   
 The news crushed Taylor. The friends talked almost daily. Their core group from Centennial got together constantly to play PlayStation. They called themselves the 'PS Squad.' No matter what was happening in life, they took the time to play, trash talk and catch up. Taylor always looked forward to those moments.
   
 "I got a few good friends that we all keep in contact to this day. And he was one of the few that I talked to almost every day," Taylor said. "Even though it was maybe through PlayStation or whenever I came home from college, we all hung out and went to play basketball. He was one person that was just a constant person in my life."
   
 Goodman's death happened a month before Taylor's first NFL training camp. He struggled with motivation and leaned on past coaches for guidance.
   
 "At first, it was very difficult losing a friend, especially a friend that was as close to me as he was," Taylor said. "It was kind of hard to be in the right mental state about anything, really."
   
 The advice he took to heart was that he should honor and play for Goodman.
   
 Honoring 'Tank'
   
 The email sat in Reese's inbox and she wasn't sure what to do. Initially apprehensive, she spoke with Candy Crary of the NFL on Aug. 31. Crary explained how players were honoring people in the name of social justice. Although her son's situation was different, his name was among those requested.
   
 Reese was shocked.
   
 "For my son to be honored in that way, I was just completely floored," Reese said. "As a parent, I know the type of child that my son was. Even the person that took his life he was helping. For him to be honored at that level was actually breathtaking. For his name to be recognized at a national level is something big, because I'm in the process of starting a foundation. Now people across the world will want to know -- "who is this Tank Goodman?'"
   
 Initially, Reese didn't know Taylor requested the name. People back in Corona didn't even know it was happening until after Taylor made his NFL debut against Miami. When word got around, he took a picture and sent it to friends and coaches. The gesture resonated with everyone who knew Goodman.
   
 "It brought tears to my eyes to see," said Logan. "Everybody down here thought it was a truly, truly remarkable tribute to our fallen teammate and friend. It was amazing."
   
 Following the game, Taylor had an emotional phone call with Reese. The pain is still fresh. It won't go away anytime soon, but that helmet made for a nice moment for people who truly needed it.
   
 "His mom ended up calling me after my first game, and she told me how much it meant to her for me to put his name on the back of his helmet and how much it meant for her family," Taylor said. "I guess you could say it was a little bittersweet."
   
 "It was emotional. I cried," Reese said. "It's bittersweet. For me, it was exciting, but then it was like, 'Wow, why does he have to be honored in such a way when he could have been [here]?' People saw the light that he shared on so many when he was alive. So it was very, very emotional, but a happy emotional, because he used his platform to recognize my son."
   
 Jamal "Tank" Goodman is gone, but not forgotten. J.J. Taylor has made sure of that.

Tenants nationwide have already been evicted legally, illegally, and informally during COVID-19, and many more face devastating debt that could lead to an eviction down the road. Historic numbers of young people are moving back in with their parents. Rent paid with credit cards has increased 43%; one in ten renters have withdrawn money from retirement accounts for rent. Only one solution will ensure no one else is evicted during COVID-19: universal rent cancellation, funded by taxing the rich and letting corporate landlords take the hit they can afford. We must also address the housing crisis that existed before COVID-19, by urgently reclaiming vacant apartments to house the homeless, implementing aggressive rent control, and massively investing in affordable social housing.

La vicenda sempre più contraddittoria e inquietante dell’asilo Giampaoli di Marina si è arricchita ieri dell’ennesimo sgradevole episodio che ha contribuito a gettare ancora più nello sconforto i genitori degli 85 bambini - adesso in realtà ottanta, visto che cinque sono stati ritirati - e quelli del comitato scuole Villa Ceci che hanno sostenuto la battaglia per dare una sistemazione ai bambini rimasti senza sede per il protrarsi dei lavori di ristrutturazione avviati dal comune alla Giampaoli.      A raccontarlo è il protagonista, il signor Carlo Lamperti, membro del comitato Scuole Villa Ceci. “Abbiamo saputo dell’incontro con il sindaco e con la nuova reggente, la professoressa Alessandra Valsega, che sostituisce al momento la dirigente ancora vacante, da un comunicato stampa dell’amministrazione. Data l’ora della convocazione, le 11,45 di ieri mattina, abbiamo potuto essere presenti in pochi perché la maggior parte dei genitori era al lavoro o a prendere i figli a scuola. Ci è stata prospettata la possibilità di mettere parte dei bambini della Giampaoli nella struttura oggi vuota del Casone a Marina di Massa gestita dalla preside Valsega. L’operazione richiede un intervento da 5000 euro per un adeguamento degli spazi chiusi da tempo e l’attivazione del servizio gratuito dei pulmini per portare i bambini a scuola.” L’opzione a detta di Lamperti e dei genitori della Giampaoli è stata presentata un po’ come “ prendere o lasciare”: la preside ha infatti ricordato a tutti che la materna non è scuola dell’obbligo per cui i bambini possono tranquillamente essere tenuti a casa. Molte le perplessità avanzate dai genitori sia per il trasporto di bambini molto piccoli, sia per il problema di chi si ritrova con due figli in scuole diverse ma soprattutto è stato messo in luce come tutta l’offerta formativa proposta dall’istituto comprensivo Taliercio, sia per la materna sia per la primaria – in cui spicca il caso dell’elementare Doganella, trasferita “ temporaneamente” alla scuola della Grotta di Avenza e ancora lì da oltre quattro anni – sia stata completamente disattesa. Lamperti ha riferito di animi che si sono accesi, ieri mattina, nel confronto col sindaco e con la preside Valsega e delle molte richieste fatte dai genitori per avere un’indicazione più precisa sulla fine dei lavori alla Giampaoli “ essendo venuta meno la fiducia sulle promesse dell’amministrazione in seguito al caso della Doganella”.      “Proprio io ho chiesto al sindaco di dare un termine definitivo per la fine dei lavori - ha aggiunto Lamperti - e mi sono sentito mandare a quel paese dal primo cittadino che ha poi spiegato di non considerarmi un cittadino normale in quanto sono il responsabile della pagina della pagina facebook Comitato genitori Scuole Villa Ceci e sono l’autore dei post che, a detta del sindaco, attaccano sempre la sua amministrazione.”. Lamperti non ha riferito del diverbio col sindaco nella sua relazione quotidiana sulla pagina facebook del comitato scrivendo di voler sorvolare sulle parole del sindaco, ma, non ha mancato di testimoniare la delusione e lo sconforto dei genitori davanti “ad istituzioni senza vergogna che badano solo ed esclusivamente ai loro interessi.”      Sono stati proprio i genitori della Giampaoli a chiedere l’intervento del comitato per avere più forza e capacità di essere ascoltati per risolvere la questione dell’asilo ancora con i lavori in corso. La soluzione riassunta quindi dal comitato sulla pagina facebook resta quella del Casone, con un ulteriore esborso di 5000 euro che, secondo i genitori, sarebbe stato meglio impiegare per accelerare i lavori alla Giampaoli e far rientrare al più presto i bambini nella loro scuola. Il comitato e i genitori della Giampaoli hanno auspicato, ma con poche speranze, un rientro che non vada oltre il 19 ottobre, cioè più di un mese dopo l’inizio della scuola.

Additionally, by supplementing most traditional face-to-face mental health care with video appointments, we have essentially expanded access to care.

BASTROP -- Akins' Nate Davis displayed his speed, scoring on a run and on a pass in a 33-23 non-district victory at Memorial Stadium on Friday.
   
 Davis, a junior running back, scored on a 38-yard run early in the second quarter. Akins had recovered an onside kick to start the second half with the kicker, Josh McCormick, recovering his own kick.
   
 "He's a heck of a kicker," Cedar Creek coach Bryan Hill said about McCormick, who boomed some kickoffs out of the end zone. "He did a great job of getting on it."
   
 Davis gained 10 yards before bursting left for the 38-yard score, which increased Akins' advantage to 19-2.
   
 In the fourth quarter, Davis hauled in a 28-yard scoring strike from quarterback Quincy Welch.
   
 But Akins (1-1) had other explosive athletes in addition to Davis.
   
 Robert Mallet returned a punt 45 yards for a touchdown in the third quarter. Akins coach Humberto Garza said Mallet returned a punt for a touchdown in last week's loss to Hendrickson.
   
 "He's a dangerous weapon," Garza said.
   
 Welch, a 6-foot-4, 200-pound senior quarterback, hit Darius Peters on a 55-yard score in the second quarter.
   
 "We have great players," Garza said.
   
 Cedar Creek (0-2) finished strong on a 4-yard scoring strike from quarterback Brock McLaughlin to Aidan Prinz with no time remaining in the game.
   
 "It's obvious we got better from game one to game two," Cedar Creek coach Bryan Hill said about the 48-2 loss to Sequin in the opener last week. "And that's our goal. Nobody likes to lose, but I was very encouraged by the progression we showed…"
   
 Cedar Creek's only points in the first half came on a safety on a blocked punt Davin Winston in the end zone.
   
 But Cedar Creek scored a touchdown on a 13-yard pass to Prinz on a rollout left by McLaughlin in the third quarter.
   
 Winston scored from the one in the fourth quarter to narrow it to 26-16.
   
 Cedar Creek showed more of a running game with Dominic Mojica gaining 54 yards and Winston 50 yards.
   
 McLaughlin completed 17 of 24 passes for 174 yards but had one interception. Damian Perez had 8 receptions for 74 yards, while Prinz caught 6 passes for 91 and two touchdowns.

_" One has to consider carefully the conclusions that are to be drawn from Navalny's case. More than 100 European companies are involved in the pipeline construction, half of them from Germany. Many European workers would suffer if the construction is to be frozen,"_ he told t-online on Saturday.
 The OPCW's involvement in this case has sparked concerns in Moscow, which argued the organization has already been used in geopolitical games before.
 The chemical watchdog's authority has indeed been tarnished by a series of whistleblower revelations claiming that reports on alleged chemical attacks in Syria were deliberately altered to pin the blame for them on Damascus - in line with the position taken by the US and its allies in London and Paris long before any investigation of the incident took place. Back then, the three countries immediately launched joint airstrikes against the Syrian Army facilities after the supposed chemical attack in Douma in 2018.
 OPCW president Fernando Arias already rushed last week to declare Navalny's alleged poisoning an instance of chemical weapons use and a _" violation of international law."_ The Russian mission to the organization, meanwhile, questioned the very fact that any data on the opposition figure's case was sent by Berlin to the OPCW at all.

Ted Reed      Ojai - Ted Reed, 87, died in his Ojai, California home of complications from a stroke suffered in February of 2020, with his wife, Debra Schuffler Reed, holding him.      Born in Gassville, Arkansas, Ted has deep roots in Baxter and Marion Counties beginning with parents John Franklin "Frank" Reed and Ledia Keeter Reed. And grandparents John Wesley Reed and Martha Ann Coventon; and, George Pierce "G.P." Keeter and Frances Elizabeth "Bette" Milligan.      As the baby and last surviving sibling, he is now swapping old Arkansas, South Gate (CA), Downey (CA) and Niland (CA) stories with oldest brother J.F. Reed (Phyllis), sisters Louise Stanley (Bud) and Maxine Kelly (Jack) and best friend brother Ellwood "Wood" Reed (Louise). He's also playing ball with Wood and all are listening to blue grass and country while laughing and eating because the Reeds loved nothing more than to be together and laugh.      Ted's dad died suddenly when Ted was not yet 3. When oldest sister, Louise, and her husband, Bud, left to seek work in California, Ted went with them. Eventually, Ted's mom and all the Reed siblings ended up living in California. Ted graduated from South Gate High in 1951 and joined the service during the Korean War. He had hoped to be a paratrooper but after his high-test scores, the Army assigned him to Intelligence as a cryptographer. He discharged in 1954 as a Sergeant.      Returning to California after the war, he went to California State University Los Angeles on the GI Bill and was the first member of his family to graduate from college with a Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration. He continued with a full scholarship to Syracuse University for a Master of Public Administration degree from the Maxwell School of Business in Syracuse, NY.      During this time, he also married Margaret "Peggy" Lewis, and had two surviving children: Gretchen Reed of High Falls, NY and John Reed (Sharon) of Yorba Linda, CA.      He especially loved to share his love of music with his kids--jazz, blues, folk, surf, country, classical. And playing the bass.      Ted also shared his love of motorcycles with John. And so, hated to give up riding his Triumphs.      Ted had a 36 year long and successful career with Los Angeles County government achieving top level Administrative positions. His most fun was as the first Deputy Director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art when he helped build and develop it. And he loved being the point man for the 1984 LA Olympics as the Chief Deputy Administrative Officer. He finished his career as the Director of Beaches and Harbors which included managing Marina del Rey.      Regardless of his executive position, he'd walk in the door after work, kiss Debra, take off his 3-piece suit and change into his work jeans or overalls. He loved the land as his forebearers had. It was in his genes. His soul. That was his happy place where he found solace and rebalancing.      He loved returning to Mountain Home during his childhood to visit his much- loved Aunt Allena (Keeter Dryer), Uncle JD and cousins Fran, Rebecca and Connie. When Ted retired in 1992, he and Debra sold their South Pasadena home and bought a home with 500 acres outside of Mountain Home which Ted loved to work.      Returning to Southern California in 1998 to Ojai, a small mountain town, he developed this property and created his trademark magical gardens. He and Debra also bought a vacation home in the seaside Central California town of Cambria, "pines by the sea".      Debra and Ted also loved to travel. He hated anywhere there were American tourists. Debra called him "Robinson Crusoe"; he'd be off exploring away from crowds after Debra was allowed her half-day tour!      Ted was a good, hard-working, kind man. Humble. Decent. Quiet strength. Honest. Salt of the earth. Playful. Passionate. Stubborn. And a crazy driver. He was complex, yet simple. Debra called him her Marlboro man without the cigarettes. He was much loved by his family and especially his partner in crime for 37 years, Debra.      As much as he loved California, his heart belonged to his Arkansas Ozarks. He will be buried in Gassville next to his dad on October 6, 2020 at 2 pm. A memorial celebration of life will be held next year in his Ojai gardens.      Donations in his memory may be made to Direct Relief International, World Central Kitchen, Doctors Without Borders or Ojai Valley Land Conservancy or a charity of your choice.      Arrangements are under the care of Roller Funeral Home. Please visit our online guestbook at rollerfunrealhomes.com.

A new low for The Times
   
 There can no longer be any doubt that The New York Times is part of the Biden presidential campaign. Spewing once again unsourced facts and figures prior to the first presidential debate, The Times has managed to reach a new low.
   
 Since The Times has purportedly secured what one would think be confidential government documents, I eagerly look forward to reading about the tax returns of Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer and Hunter Biden.

 Amendment to fix our broken democracy
   
 Powerful special interests seeking to influence government policies that affect us all constantly attack what's left of our campaign finance laws ("Gaspee Project appeals ruling on suit," News, Sept. 30).
   
 If we want to live in a democracy that responds to the legitimate needs of the people, we must amend the Constitution to overturn anti-democratic Supreme Court decisions such as Citizens United v. FEC that have opened the floodgates to big money in politics, and extended our inalienable constitutional rights to artificial incorporated entities.
   
 Coastal states like Rhode Island are especially vulnerable to sea level rise associated with global warming. Champions of a stable climate like Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse should help pass the We the People Amendment (HJR.48), which would require Congress to level the political playing field for rich and poor alike, and prevent large corporations from using our constitutional rights to nullify democratically enacted public interest laws.
   
 That way, maybe Congress would take action to prevent a climate catastrophe, rather than catering to their big donors in the fossil fuel industry.

 An out-of-control bully
   
 Do we need any more proof? The man who was elected president of the United States in 2016 is an out-of-control bully.
   
 I have lived under 11 presidents, many of whom did not get my vote. I have been critical of both Democrats and Republicans. But never have I witnessed a president's public behavior that was as appalling as Donald Trump's at Tuesday's so-called debate. The man has degraded the office of the presidency by choosing to behave like an out-of-control toddler.
   
 He has shamed us in the eyes of the world's democracies. We need a president who is, at the very least, a decent and thoughtful human being, not one who finds fellowship with Mohammed bin Salman, Kim Jong-un, Vladimir Putin or Alexander Lukashenko. We deserve better.

 Police and social workers together
   
 Kudos to the Providence police who have begun to team with social workers when visiting homes ("A softer response," News, Sept 22).
   
 I was remembering that a few decades ago, my aunt, Thelma Mullins Whalen, who was a school nurse with the Providence School Department, used to visit homes of students whose families had no telephone. She often found herself teaching families that, for example, you could not just eat cake mix directly out of the box. Often this had to be done by way of non-ASL sign language.

 Appalled by Benson cartoon
   
 I was glad to see Judith Zimmer's letter of Sept. 27 regarding the Lisa Benson cartoon that appeared on the Sept. 23 commentary page, and to know I wasn't the only one who had that reaction.
   
 Like Ms. Zimmer, my jaw dropped upon seeing the cartoon, which depicted Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the ugliest, most stereotypical caricature of a Jewish woman, and implied that Justice Ginsburg was committing some kind of unconstitutional act by expressing her wish that her successor be chosen by the next-elected president, whoever that may be.
   
 I get it: Political cartoons are supposed to incite controversy, evoke emotional responses, be biting and polarizing. The best ones are clever, satirical, or enlightening. This cartoon was none of those things. It was only ugly, offensive to Ginsburg's memory, offensive to people of the Jewish faith, and not representative of who Ginsburg was.
   
 Editors have a choice whether or not to publish something. I am appalled that the Journal editors chose to go with this one.

 Much more for church to do
   
 In her commentary, Sister Mary Pendergast urges Rhode Islanders to "own" their racism and attempts an example by confessing the one-time ban on women of color in her religious order ("Let's own and overcome R.I.'s racism with Mercy," Commentary, Sept. 24).
   
 Her later pivot to praising private education shows that there is much more to own, however. Despite their claims, Rhode Island's Catholic prep schools largely function to let white parents keep their children at arm's length from their poorer, browner neighbors. It is wonderful that young women from said schools go to BLM marches, but the very existence of this separate, screened- entry system does very little for reducing racism and classism in our state.
   
 Having the notion that maintaining private educational spaces is some sort of social justice makes Sister Mary Pendergast about as anti-racist as Betsy DeVos. It must also be reiterated (apparently) that the treatment of the LGBTQ community by Catholic groups continues to be collectively atrocious, and until there is a 180 from Sister Mary Pendergast's church, advocations for people at the margins ring false.

Cornelious Brown IV threw for three touchdowns, including two to Sam Pinckney, Destin Coates rushed for two scores and Georgia State defeated East Carolina 49-29 on Saturday.
 The Panthers (1-1) rolled up 303 yards offense on their way to a 35-13 halftime lead, setting a school record for points in a half.
 On the game’s first play from scrimmage, Brown had his pass intercepted in the flat and returned 28 yards for a touchdown by Warren Saba. But the Panthers scored on their next three drives in under seven minutes, including touchdown passes of 38 yards to Pinckney and 22 yards to Jamari Thrash. Brown added a 13-yard score to Pinckney, and Coates and Tucker Gregg had TD runs for a 22-point halftime lead.
 The lead reached 42-16 early in the fourth quarter on Antavious Lane’s 34-yard interception return.

Supplying stores with products from overseas is common in the U.S. But for many locally-owned stores, doing business with neighbors is a worthwhile decision.
 Choosing to keep the entire supply chain Texan is a common value for locally- owned shops in the Crossroads. To be owned, designed, produced and sold in the Lone Star State is a draw customers and business owners keep coming back to. And because of the economic hardship in 2020, some business owners found themselves even more proactive about making their supply from here.
 When pandemic-related closures began to sweep across the country, Cotton Belles Boutique temporarily closed just as many other retail stores did.
 Store owner Ashley Henderson said the month and a half of being closed hit her store hard. After seeing what that did to her business, she and her in-store artisans who curate the selection began to focus more on American, Texas and Crossroads products — even more than before.
 “That was an eye-opener for me,” Henderson said. “I want to support people down the road from me, right here at home.”
 Henderson has traveled to markets coast to coast to select products for Cotton Belles Boutique. After taking a closer look at her store’s local focus, she realized much of her inventory was already from Texas — about 50%.
 Reasons for having local or Texan products are common among many locally-owned businesses: a unique touch, products you can’t get anywhere else, keeping cash in the community, and supporting your neighbor through a challenging time like the pandemic.
 For Henderson, she was an advocate of keeping products local before the pandemic, even using one Ganado artisan to outfit much of her wedding. Now, she plans to grow her percentage of inventory to at least include more American products.
 Higher up the supply chain, Texas-based suppliers are sharing their passion with stores and customers.
 Texas Standard is an Austin-based menswear provider for what vice president Byron Bradshaw termed the “Texas Gentleman.” Many of the company’s products are produced in El Paso and sold in stores across the state, like at Bethune & Son’s new location at 201 S. Main St., as well as in their online store.
 Being authentic to Texas is something Bradshaw said is important. As a company with its home state in mind, one clothing line includes shirts named Crockett, Lavaca, Seguin and other figure points in history. Additionally, Bradshaw has seen the company’s four years expand outside the state, with many of the total sales shipping to customers worldwide “who recognize what a Texan is.”
 “It’s probably best summed up in a quote that says ‘Texas is neither southern nor western, Texas is Texas,’” Bradshaw said. “We’re designing specifically for our neighbors.”
 Working both sides of retail and supply is also happening in Victoria.
 Sweet Chic Boutique, which is planning a temporary store in the Victoria Mall starting Nov. 20, utilized Victoria Coffee Roasters coffee as a way of remaining open and keeping revenue coming throughout the pandemic shutdowns.
 The Hallettsville boutique sells clothing items as well as coffee and sweets. Similar stores without a food component were forced to close for a time during the pandemic, but with the food and drink sales, business is even stronger now.
 “We are blessed,” said co-owner Janelle Bludau. “All of our coffee and dessert sales were crazy. That’s what held us through.”

Typically, the immunogenicity of potential vaccines is assessed in individual lab analyses, which aim to see whether biomarkers of immune response — such as antibodies and T-cell responses — are produced after clinical trial volunteers receive a dose, or doses, of the vaccine candidate. But with more than 320 COVID-19 vaccine candidates in the works, Saville said, the many differences in data collection and evaluation methods are an issue. As well as potential variations in markers of immunity, there are differences in how and where samples are collected, transported and stored — all of which can impact the quality and usefulness of the data produced, and make comparisons tricky. And with a range of different vaccine technologies being explored — from viral vector vaccines to ones based on messenger RNA — standard evaluation of their true potential “becomes very complex”, she said.

 Unauthorized parties have always been prohibited by Airbnb, but the service has previously allowed hosts and guests to agree on hosting small parties. It has also allowed hosts to tell guests to "use their best judgment," according to Airbnb.
 However, on August 20, the home rental service announced that it would be banning all parties and limiting reservations to allow no more than 16 guests to stay at a home to help curb the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
 Airbnb said the rules were part of a string of initiatives in light of the coronavirus pandemic and that they would remain in effect indefinitely.
