Funding a cash-strapped Postal Service has quickly turned into a top campaign issue as Trump presses his unsupported claim that increased mail-in voting will undermine the credibility of the election and Democrats push back.
 Trump, who spent the weekend at his New Jersey golf club, derided universal mail-in voting as a “scam” and defended DeJoy as the right person to “streamline the post office and make it great again.”
 “Louis he is working very hard,” Trump said at a news conference Saturday. “But as you know, the Democrats aren’t approving proper funding for postal, and they’re not approving the proper funding for this ridiculous thing they want to do which is all mail-in voting.”
 His chief of staff tried on Sunday to counter criticism that Trump was trying to stifle turnout with national and battleground state polls showing him facing a difficult path to reelection against Democrat Joe Biden.

That leaves Tyron Smith as the only tackle on the roster with legitimate NFL experience. For the time being, young players like Wyatt Miller and Terence Steele have been presented with a big opportunity.

Every spring all of the farmers I know start to get super antsy and excited to get planting done, only to roll right in to hay season (or whatever crops they grow), then followed immediately by corn harvest in the fall. There is no time for breaks, just a lot of racing to beat the next rainstorm and praying for good summer sun. When they’re planting those seeds, they are planting hope; hope for the future, but it’s important not to forget to take some time every now and then to admire the present moments.
 Summers on the farm now are just a blur of sunrises and sunsets, parts runs, and farmer tans. Growing up working on a small dairy farm, my summers weren’t what a ‘typical’ high school kid experienced. There were no regular pool parties with friends or trips to amusement parks. Summers meant hay season, and the beginning stages of “harvest season”. Summers as a farm kid meant unloading a dozen hay wagons of small square bales during the hottest parts of the day, taking a break to milk cows, and unloading more hay late into the night. Aside from a trip to the local ice cream shop and a week’s break to show cows at the county fair, summers were different from many of my peers, but I wouldn’t trade it for the world. Weeks’ worth of putting in hard work with my grandpa, uncle, and cousins seemed long and exhausting but I didn’t realize the bigger picture I was witnessing. From the early days of spring when those first seeds were planted to the final hay crop of the year, I don’t think I ever realized just how much farmers sacrificed, prayed, and depended on the help of others. Life during crop season seems to be a constant imbalance of praying for rain, then praying for it to stop. The goal is always to make enough quality feed for our animals and support our livelihoods, that sometimes we, as adults forget to see the bigger picture. As a farm family, some of our brightest moments are on our longest, most tiring days.
 I have lived these seasons first-hand the majority of my life and still, every year seems increasingly difficult. Maybe it’s because I’m older and not my spry teenage self or maybe it’s because I’m not only reporting to ‘do a job’ and I’m more invested in the farm itself. Instead of focusing on equipment breakdowns and less than ideal weather, I’ve been reminded (many times) to focus on the things that we can control and try to take everything else in stride (easier said than done, I know!). It is important to take the time to appreciate what we have been given.
 Things as simple as a young, bright eyed child strapped in the tractor buddy- seat so excited to be riding with grandpa while mowing hay. Appreciating evening drives with dad to look at the new corn seedlings emerging from the ground.

The Big Ten has received considerable blowback for its decision last week to postpone the 2020 football season. And one of the loudest voices to emerge has been that of parents of Big Ten players.
 The moms and dads of players from Iowa, Nebraska, Ohio State and Penn State are leading the charge. They want to know the thought process that went into making the decision to pull the plug on the season. The Rivals.com Iowa site-- HawkeyeReport.com--provided a detailed look at the campaign by Hawkeye parents.
 According to HawkeyeReport.com, the Iowa parents are looking to have meetings and input in the process, along with the players and coaches who have been impacted by the decision and hope to have a response by August 19th.
 Will the action by parents make a difference? Stay tuned.  
 The football parents at another Big Ten school apparently have no plans to take their concerns over postponement of the 2020 season to the conference office in Rosemont, Ill.
 "At this point, I have not had any parents voice frustration to me with the Big 10’s decision," a Big Ten head coach texted to GoldandBlack.com on Sunday morning. "They (parents) were genuinely concerned (about the health/safety of players) prior to the decision."
 From what GoldandBlack.com has learned, it doesn't appear that Purdue parents have any intent to organize, either.
 Big Ten commissioner Kevin Warren has said the conference made its decision on Tuesday based on the advice it had gotten from medical experts amid reports that multiple Big Ten players had been diagnosed with myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart that can be linked with viral infections.
 Indiana true freshman offensive lineman Brady Feeney had a serious health scare with COVID-19, as outlined by his mother in a Facebook post earlier this month.  
 The decision not to play this fall by the Big Ten was abrupt. The league unveiled a revised 10-game, Big Ten-only schedule on Wednesday, August 5. Then, six days later on August 11, the conference postponed the season.  
 The unknown long-term health impact of infection by COVID-19 is a big concern, as well as the aforementioned developing knowledge of the virus’ impact on the heart. The Big Ten felt the health and safety of its players would be in too much peril if a season was played.

He also has an ongoing record of 39 successive points finishes.


  Yet days like Sunday, when it all comes together in an almost out-of-body experience behind the wheel, are rare and to be treasured.


  The late Brazilian triple champion Ayrton Senna, Hamilton's boyhood idol, spoke of one such occurrence when he qualified for the 1988 Monaco Grand Prix after lapping "well beyond my conscious understanding".


  Hamilton said he would not describe his experience in the same way as Senna but he had felt that sense of perfect equilibrium.


  "There is an immense amount of pressure on all of us to perform weekend in and weekend out," he said.


  "And the goal is always to chase for perfection and be in that zone, you can be very close but still slightly out and not be quite near your perfect rhythm. But for whatever reason today, it felt like I was in the most … it was like a clear zone.


  "There was a clarity I had today whilst driving that was...I'm sure I've had it before but I don't even know really to get into that zone. It's hard to say what helps you get into that place.


  "I felt fantastic in the car. It was physically challenging but not making any mistakes, delivering lap upon lap. I was in the perfect zone. That's the zone that I dream of being in."


  Hamilton said that he was gaining time even when catching traffic.


  When he got to the chequered flag, having lapped all but the top three and with second-placed Max Verstappen 24 seconds down the road behind him, he had no idea it was the finish and was set to carry on.


  "I was like a horse with those blockers on, I was just going to keep going," he said.


  "I was just in a daze out there."

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp issued an executive order Saturday extending coronavirus restrictions while also addressing the issue of local face-mask mandates.
   
 Though specifics weren't available at press time Saturday night, the new executive order allows local governments to make masks mandatory on public property but restricts such mandates for private property, Atlanta's WSB-TV reported.
   
 The governor's aides said Friday that the order would clear the way for cities and counties to impose a face covering requirement if they meet "health- related metrics" and other guidelines. Kemp continues to oppose a statewide mask mandate, insisting the best policy is to encourage and not require their use.
   
 Under the order, local governments could apply the mask requirements to businesses only if owners consent to it, Kemp administration officials said Friday. Authorities would also have to issue at least one warning before writing a citation.
   
 It's a departure from Kemp's long-standing approach toward mask requirements, which he's said were unnecessary and unenforceable. His office frames it as an attempt to compromise after settlement talks reached a "stalemate."
   
 "Of most importance, this order will contain very strong protections for business owners and private property," Kemp spokeswoman Candice Broce said Friday.
   
 "Specifically for businesses, the owner will still be able to decide whether to have a face covering requirement or not," she said. "If the owner decides to have a face covering requirement, the owner can decide who enforces it."
   
 Democrats accused Kemp of trying to shift attention after he scuttled his lawsuit over Atlanta's mask mandate.
   
 "It's just an attempt to save face. The cities have already been doing this, and now he's going behind them after the fact to try to set parameters," said Democratic state Sen. Jen Jordan of Sandy Springs. "The fact that he's tried to stop local mask mandates is astounding."
   
 Kemp signed an order in July that explicitly bans cities and counties from enforcing mask mandates, and he accused Atlanta and more than a dozen other local governments with face-covering ordinances of defying his order. He went to court to block Atlanta from requiring masks and pursuing other coronavirus restrictions, namely "phase one" guidelines that encourage restaurants to close dining rooms and urge residents to leave home only for essential trips.
   
 On Thursday, he abruptly dropped the lawsuit and blamed Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms for refusing to "agree to a settlement that safeguards the rights of private property owners." She called those remarks "woefully inaccurate" but said she's grateful he abandoned the court case.
   
 Cities have said they believe they have the power to enforce local mask orders, said Rusi Patel, a lawyer for the Georgia Municipal Association.
   
 "GMA believes in local control and believes Georgia laws provide a large degree of local control, even in times of emergency. We filed a brief in the litigation supporting this concept a few weeks ago," Patel wrote in an email. "However, the question of legality is one for the courts at the end of the day."
   
 President Donald Trump's coronavirus task force has encouraged Kemp to take stricter measures to contain the disease, warning in a report obtained by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that Georgia continues to see "widespread and expanding community viral spread."
   
 The report "strongly recommends" that Kemp adopt a statewide mandate, as well as shutter nightclubs, bars and gyms in the highest-risk counties.
   
 About 15 cities have citywide mask polices in place and roughly 100 others require masks on their government property, said Larry Hanson, the executive director of the Georgia Municipal Association.
   
 A recent Atlanta Journal-Constitution review found the mandates were scarcely enforced. The newspaper contacted 15 police departments and law enforcement agencies in the cities, suburbs and small towns that enacted the restrictions. Not a single citation was reported.

PSNI officers in riot gear raid a housing complex in the New Lodge area of Belfast as they search for petrol bombs which were to be used against them later that night. It was July and I was privileged to have the chance to travel to Belfast to cover the contentious Twelfth celebrations.

"One of the things we promised ourselves was this was going to be fluid, day- to-day situation and we'd be on a perpetual state of observing and gathering information," Warren said on the day of postponement. "The over-arching reason and the over-arching issue we had to always keep at the top of our mind was the health, safety and wellness of our student-athletes was at the top of my list."
 Just like that, Big Ten presidents and Warren made one of the boldest moves in the history of college sports. There will be no football in the fall of 2020 in the Big Ten. And the ramifications of the decision will have a tidal-wave of consequences—many of which are financial.
 In the aftermath of the decision not to play, Nebraska and Ohio State postured about going rogue and playing games outside the Big Ten if the 2020 season was shuttered. But each school subsequently backed off those plans.
 While the Pac-12 joined the Big Ten in punting on the 2020 season, the SEC, Big 12 and ACC—the other three Power Five leagues—are pushing forward. And their hopes could be buoyed by the development of a COVID-19 saliva test called SalivaDirect that may be a game-changer to control the spread of the virus.
 While the saliva test is promising on many levels, it likely won't be able to impact the 2020 college football season. Testing, development, distribution issues remain. But it offers hope to perhaps play in the spring, which is the Big Ten's plan.
 For now, the Big Ten has opted to err on the side of caution. And the SEC, ACC and Big 12 may be forced to do the same as the season inches closer. Schools already are seeing spikes in infections as students return to campuses across the nation.
 Many questions loom in an ever-shifting college football landscape.

MINNEAPOLIS -- Whit Merrifield felt like he let opposing pitchers get away with a few pitches they shouldn't have in the first game of Saturday's doubleheader. So he came out swinging in Game 2.


   


  The Kansas City Royals outfielder and leadoff hitter doubled on the first pitch of the game and kept pouring it on from there. He went 3 for 4, hit the game-altering three-run homer in a tie game and drove in all four of his club's runs in a 4-2 victory.


   


  With Merrifield driving the offense, the Royals split the twin bill at Target Field after losing the first game by the same score. Royals manager Mike Matheny, in his first season with the club, picked up his 600th career win. His .552 winning percentage (600-486) is fourth highest among active managers.


   


  Merrifield came within a triple of hitting for the cycle for the second time this season. Catcher Cam Gallagher reached base three times with a walk and a pair of hits, while second baseman Nicky Lopez also collected two hits and a walk for the Royals (9-12).


   


  "I was upset with my aggression in the first game," Merrifield said. "I felt like I let some balls go by that I wasn't ready to hit. I made that mental adjustment going into Game 2 and got some good pitches to hit and put some good swings on them."


   


  Merrifield swung at the first pitch in all three at-bats against Twins starter Jose Berrios and he smashed two for extra bases. He fouled off the first pitch he saw in his second at-bat before he hit the second for an RBI single.


   


  Merrifield's fourth-inning, three-run home run, also on a first pitch, tipped the game in the Royals' favor. Adalberto Mondesi reached on a fielder's choice and Gallagher laid off a 3-2 slider to draw a walk and set the table for Merrifield.


   


  Merrifield's fifth homer of the season moved him into a tie with Jorge Soler and Miakel Franco for the team lead. Franco homered in the first game of Saturday's doubleheader.


   


  Royals starting pitcher Danny Duffy allowed two runs (one earned) on two hits and one walk, and he struck out eight in five innings to earn his first win of the season.


   


  The Royals left the bases loaded without scoring a run in the first inning, then Duffy ran into trouble right out of the gate.


   


  An error by first baseman Ryan O'Hearn allowed the first batter to reach. After a single and a wild pitch, Duffy faced the heart of the Twins' batting order with runners on second and third with no outs in the first inning.


   


  Duffy limited the damage to one run on a Marwin Gonzalez sacrifice fly that drove in Mitch Garver. The Twins made Duffy throw 27 first-inning pitches.


   


  The Royals evened the score in the second inning on a Merrifield RBI single that drove in Lopez. The score remained deadlocked at a run apiece until Merrifield's homer in the fourth.


   


  Duffy, who made his fifth start of the season, settled in after the first inning. He retired 12 of 13 during a stretch from the end of the first into the fifth. His one miscue came on a solo home run by Twins designated hitter Nelson Cruz in the fourth.

TALLMADGE -- The school board has affirmed that the schools will proceed with the hybrid plan approved by them, but parents will be given more time to choose the online plan if they have changed their minds.  
 Superintendent Jeff Ferguson said at Wednesday's special board meeting that he received additional guidance and recommendations from the Summit County Public Health on Monday and reviewed those options. The school board asked Ferguson to revisit the plans for the school district.  
 Donna Skoda, health commissioner of the Summit County Public Health, said she approved the plan, Ferguson said.  
 "It was based on layers [of safety] and our ability to create safety in the hybrid plan," Ferguson said. "For a district to run a hybrid she [Skoda] was looking for, we had or exceeded her expectations in the plan."  
 Tallmadge School District has the mandatory masks, 6-foot distancing, and key things in the new buildings like ventilation and spacing to keep students safe, he said. Classes are scheduled to begin resuming Aug. 26.  
 Ferguson said Skoda would "be very supportive of this plan for opening. As a hybrid plan, she said ours met or exceeded everything she would look for in a hybrid plan and we were blessed with resources other districts did not have."  
 Board member Christy Cipa asked for the district to allow open enrollment again in case those who choose to come to school have second thoughts.  
 Ferguson said the Tallmadge Online link will be on the web and the Tallmadge Schools Reopening Plan is listed on the school website for those with questions. Back to School packets go home on Thursday. The Tallmadge Ready Together Plan is on the web and families can email staff who are in the buildings now.  
 Families who had already made a choice can make changes by going to the school website at www.tallmadgeschools.org.  
 Sports have not changed with low-risk sports moving forward and training for high-risk sports at the level 3 protocols with a recommendation for competition to begin Oct. 1, Ferguson said.  
 "We want to do what is right for kids, family, and staff," said board member Chris Tywon. "I think we have a really well thought out plan. We've given the option for kids to go to school or stay at home. I'm excited to hear the response from the health board. I'm liking this level 2 and I think that's where we ought to be."  
 School board president Rick Kellar said the board received a lot of communications from families.  
 "We represent everybody," Kellar said. "We as a board and school administration are aware this decision in the manner we reopen schools has a great impact on everyone in the district."  
 Kellar said the best way to educate children is in front of teachers and with each other. He stressed that parents need to keep sick children home and to practice the same safe rules at home that students and staff will practice at school.  
 "We need everyone to lean into this seriously," Kellar said. "It's necessary for you to follow those guidelines and be an example to your children and neighbors."  
 If numbers spike, the district will be at level 3, he said.  
 "Nobody in this community prefers that," he said. "We need to support each other. If a parent opts to keep a child at home, let's assume it's a good reason and don't battle on social media. We don't know their situation or reason for choices."  
 Teachers are essential workers, Cipa said.  
 "We depend on you to teach our children in the best way to be successful and the best way to do that is face to face," she said. "The board and parents appreciate you."

EDENTON — Normally during this time of year, high school athletes would be preparing to play fall sports.
 Because of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, high school sports contests are on hold and athletic programs across the state are attempting to have some normalcy by conducting workout sessions.
 This week was set to be the opening week of games for the North Carolina High School Athletic Association 2020-21 athletic year.
 The association revised its athletic calendar on Aug. 12 to have sports begin in November if the virus subsides.
 The coronavirus pandemic brought sports in the United States to a halt on March 11 when professional basketball player Rudy Gobert of the NBA’s Utah Jazz tested positive for coronavirus.
 That led the NBA and other sports entities across the nation to either suspend or cancel sporting events.
 The NCHSAA suspended activities on March 13 during its spring sports season.
 The association canceled its spring sports season on April 24.
 On June 15, the NCHSAA — along with the approval of a high school’s local education agency (i.e. school board) — allowed summer workouts to begin for athletes.
 While other NCHSAA member school districts delayed the start of summer workouts to late June, July or beyond, John A. Holmes High School was one of the few NCHSAA member schools to begin summer workouts the week of June 15.
 Holmes athletic director Wes Mattera credits his high school athletic department staff, school administration and the Edenton-Chowan Schools administration for getting together early in the process.
 The AD added that vital for student-athletes to begin to workouts was to craft a plan to proceed with workouts safely during the pandemic.
 Mattera credited the addition of athletic trainer Courtney Phelps for helping in the process of developing a plan.
 Before Phelps became the athletic trainer at John A. Holmes this year, she held the same role at Currituck County High School.
 She also serves as the athletic trainer for the Edenton Steamers baseball club and is a member of the Region 1 Sports Medicine Advisory Committee (SMAC).
 Mattera noted Phelps’ involvement in the committee allowed her to work with some of the top athletic trainers and doctors in the state.
 Her involvement with the committee also helped Holmes gain an understanding of what was required in a plan to return to workouts.
 Mattera noted once a return to activities plan was crafted, it was presented to then Edenton-Chowan Schools superintendent Rob Jackson and current superintendent Michael Sasscer along with Holmes principal Steve Wood and the entire Edenton-Chowan Schools board of education.
 Once the plan for the high school was approved by the board, fall sports student-athletes (men’s and women’s cross country, men’s soccer, football, volleyball and women’s tennis) were able to return to campus to begin summer workouts.
 By being proactive, it allowed the Aces to begin workouts in June.
 Mattera acknowledged that the first week of workouts was hectic due to trying to get student-athletes to complete required forms.
 The AD credits the website Rank One Sport Plus Health, which allowed student- athletes to complete athletic forms online and send them to the school, in helping in the process of obtaining documents.
 For football, athletes are split into three groups that workout in one-hour intervals in the morning.
 The volleyball team trains inside the gym in limited numbers in the morning, while the men’s soccer team trains in afternoon.
 The school’s men’s and women’s cross country teams train individually, but are able to track their time with an app.
 Mattera added that Edenton’s cross country coach Matt Goetsch is able to track the athletes via the app.
 On a typical training day, Phelps along with select coaches are on campus around 8 a.m. and set up stations with contactless forehead thermometers.
 Student-athletes then arrive to their designated screening staging area by sport on campus. Hand sanitizer is available for each sport.
 Mattera noted that each coach has a contactless forehead thermometer to check an athlete’s temperature in case Phelps is not able to do so.
 Technology has been key in helping Holmes have its athletes participate in workouts.
 Mattera credits Phelps for implementing a QR barcode system for each team.
 Student-athletes will answer screening questions on their cell phone and have their temperature taken.
 During the screening process, Phelps uses her laptop computer to check to see if any athletes have answered yes to any of the screening questions.
 The system gives the school a database in case there is a need to review an athlete.
 Holmes initially used iPads for student-athletes to be screened before a workout session, but migrated to the barcode system.
 “It was taking everyone a long time to get through the process,” Phelps said of the process before the barcode system.
 The shift in technology helped Phelps streamline screening athletes.
 By conducting research online, Phelps was able to find the QR barcode system and implemented it at Edenton over two weeks ago.
 “It is so much more of an easier process for everyone,” Phelps said.
 Phelps acknowledged athletes and coaches have done a good job following protocol, but added she stresses the importance of social distancing to the athletes when they are away from campus.
 “They have gotten on board because they want to be here,” Phelps said of the athletes.
 Student-athletes have provided positive feedback on the protocols.
 “They are glad to have some discipline and some structure and to be around their teammates in a competitive setting; as competitive as we can make in the phases,” Mattera said.
 Current workouts are in the NCHSAA’s second phase, which allows athletes to train with sport-specific equipment like a football or a tennis racket.
 The process of screening athletes has worked.
 Mattera noted two student-athletes at Holmes tested positive for COVID-19.
 One athlete, who contracted the virus before summer workouts began, has since been cleared by the regional health department.
 The other athlete had a positive test since Holmes began workouts.
 The second athlete was not around their training group when the athlete was believed to have the virus.
 According to Mattera, as of Aug. 11, the second athlete was in quarantine.
 Holmes alerted the regional health department in both cases.
 The health department evaluated both cases in terms of contact tracing and symptoms.
 Mattera credits having a good infrastructure of support and was grateful to have an administration that understands athletics, having a trainer who is involved with SMAC, having Holmes head football coach Paul Hoggard on multiple committees and being able to contact fellow athletic directors across the state for support.
 Edenton also has the resource of its head men’s soccer coach Thomas DiMartino, a doctor in the Vidant health system, who has experience dealing with the virus.
 With the summer wood bat baseball season over in Edenton, Mattera acknowledged the importance of high school athletics to the community.
 “We are fortunate. We do have a very sports-minded community,” he said. “I’m hoping we can get back to some type of normalcy. Our kids need it. Our community needs it. We have so many businesses that support us. For our entire area, we need it.”

La orquesta de cumbia Grupo 5 volvió a los escenarios luego de pasar más de cuatro meses alejados de sus seguidores debido al coronavirus. Mediante un show en vivo por Fiestas Patrias, Christian Yaipén, Pedro Loli, Kike Farro, Rodrigo Tavela y Pepe Menis, junto a toda la orquesta se reunieron para cantarle al Perú.

As many of you know, two of my greatest interests are business and sports. I think one of the main reasons for this is that both business and sports are highly competitive.
   
 I enjoy competition.
   
 As a young person, playing sports was my best outlet. As I grew older - and became more focused on education, research and leadership - I became more interested in determining what makes sports teams and business/nonprofit organizations successful.
   
 Years of observation and participation in many organizations have led me to believe that one of the keys to success, both on and off the sports field, is what is known as "team chemistry."
   
 An excellent working definition of team chemistry is provided by Dr. Scott Williams, a professor of management at Wright State University's Raj Soin College of Business: "The composition of a team and the relationships among its team members."
   
 Chemistry arises from each individual on the team and their interactions with each other. In my experience, I have found team chemistry can be very fragile. The addition or subtraction of just one person can have significant impact on chemistry, and with it, team success.
   
 I will provide a couple of examples from the world of sports and one from my current organization that will hopefully be instructive as you try to improve your own team chemistry.
   
 My first example is the 2003-2004 Georgia Tech basketball team. It went to the NCAA Final Four (only the second time in school history) and ultimately lost in the championship game to the University of Connecticut, finishing the season with a record of 28 wins and 10 losses.
   
 What makes that team remarkable is that in the previous season, Tech finished 16-15 and did not qualify for the NCAA tournament, and that the most-talented player from that season, Chris Bosh, who had averaged over 20 points and 11 rebounds a game, declared for the NBA draft, meaning he would not return for 2003-2004 season.
   
 Georgia Tech basically went into the 2003-2004 season as it did in 2002-2003 - minus its best player. Bosh's replacement, senior Clarence Moore, averaged only about 6 points and 5 rebounds a game.
   
 So, how did Georgia Tech achieve so much more success in 2003-2004 with less talent? Team chemistry.
   
 This is not an indictment of Bosh. His seemed liked by his teammates and he went on to have a successful professional career, including four NBA Finals appearances with the Miami Heat that resulted in two championships.
   
 However, having a star of Bosh's magnitude did not seem to mesh as well with the "whole is greater than the parts"-type players that comprised the Georgia Tech team. Bosh's great talent probably caused his teammates to sometimes defer to him, whereas Moore appeared to be the unselfish and experienced "glue guy" that brought the team together. The result was much better team chemistry and, ultimately, much greater success.
   
 The lesson here is that an extremely talented person on your team can sometimes hurt the team chemistry, even if that person tries his or her best to be a "team player."
   
 One would be hard-pressed to identify a more talented player and better teammate than former NFL quarterback Peyton Manning, but you may not realize it was the year after he left the University of Tennessee that the school won a National Championship.
   
 A second example is the Atlanta Braves from the 2018 season through the present. The Braves were clearly in a rebuilding phase from 2015 to 2017. The team was loaded with young talent but it was not expected to challenge the Washington Nationals and its other divisional rivals in 2018 and 2019. However, the Braves won the division in each of those seasons and are doing well so far in the shortened 2020 season, despite the depletion of their starting pitching staff and other injuries.
   
 I believe team chemistry has played a significant role in this success. One reason is that the Braves' older, veteran players have been very welcoming of the their younger counterparts. In many sports franchises, the veterans feel threatened by younger - often more talented - players. The Braves' veterans appear more focused on winning as a team than individual success, thus enhancing chemistry.
   
 The chemistry has also been enhanced by management and players embracing diversity. The Braves are a great mix of age, race, ethnicity and personalities (from the stoic Nick Markakis to the exuberant Ronald Acuna Jr. and Ozzie Albies). They appreciate their differences and talents, and are bound by a common goal of winning.
   
 Braves management empowers players to be involved in decision-making. Prior to signing free agents such as Josh Donaldson, Yasiel Puig and Marcel Ozuna, management consulted players, including team leader Freddie Freeman, to help in the vetting process.
   
 Empowerment typically enhances chemistry, and the Braves are a great example of team chemistry and success.
   
 I have been Dean of Augusta University's Hull College of Business for just under four years. As I have worked with my team to make it more successful, I have consciously worked on assuring good organizational chemistry. While those in academia are more like baseball players than basketball players - in that their performance is done more individually than collectively - it still takes teamwork to be successful.
   
 As we continue to build our team, one of my big drivers has been ensuring new members "fit." Fit does not mean everyone is the same. We look for folks whose skillsets complement those already in the organization. In addition, we are looking for people who are focused on both organizational and individual success while also being good colleagues.
   
 We hired seven new faculty members last year. And while they are all very talented, it was their "fit" that was more important. Hence, I believe we have great chemistry at Hull because we identify people with complementary skills who strive for organizational success.
   
 My colleagues in AU's College of Science and Mathematics probably understand the science of chemistry much better than I do. However, when it comes to the art of team chemistry, I have learned much from sports and business.
   
 The writer is dean of the Hull College of Business at Augusta University.

So how big is your God, to you personally, and is there anything He can’t do?


  My God changed plain water into wine, fed thousands of people with only a couple loaves of bread and a few fish, He speaks and the mighty oceans obey Him, He walks on water, He healed lepers that no one else would come near, and He raised people from the dead. The greatest thing He ever did was to die for us so we would have the opportunity to be set free from sin. Even knowing all that, I have a hard time realizing just how big He is. He makes things happen that many of us view as coincidences.


  Personally, I don’t believe in coincidences.


  I want to tell you a story from “25 Powerful Promises from God” by Mike Shreve, about Providence United Methodist Church in Swan Quarter, N.C.


  In 1874 a group of believers decided to build a church. After much prayer they found a prime location they felt God was directing them to. However, the property was owned by Samuel Sadler and he refused to sell to the church, forcing them to raise their church in another, less desirable, location.

One thing that has been quite apparent as the COVID-19 crisis has progressed is that Idaho is woefully unable to provide internet accessibility to all its residents. As parents and school districts struggle with whether or not it is safe to send students back to the classroom in the fall, one of their other chief concerns is what to do with students who have no internet, not to mention computer accessibility.
 One group, called Close the Divide, has sought to provide new and used computers to more than 200,000 Idaho school children so they will be able to continue learning remotely. We all have opinions on how students will be taught this fall. And whether you like it or not, it appears that most schools will be doing at least some of their teaching over the internet. So the need for computers is imperative.
 The goal of Close the Divide was to put these computers in the hands of students this fall. You can sponsor a student for $350 or a classroom for $7,000. You can contact your local school district to see best how to help in your area or check their website at www.idahobe.org.
 Personally, I am hoping to see the Idaho Legislature step up to the plate during its special session and dole out some of those federal relief dollars to our schools for projects such as this.
 The other issue, but not quite so simple, centers around Idaho’s desperate need to expand broadband access to our rural communities across the state.
 Our metropolitan areas are doing a fine job of providing internet services to their populations. But the rural, mountainous areas of the state are struggling. Only 35 percent of north central Idaho homes have access to internet. And to our immediate north, Benewah County suffers the same dismal percentage.
 Fortunately, Gov. Brad Little has been trying to improve this situation.
 In May of 2019, Little appointed a task force to develop ways to improve Idaho’s broadband access and speed. He appointed an impressive group of individuals who have come out with some exceptional recommendations.
 Some of the best include:
 l Give students and their families the tools to succeed.
 l Help all communities increase their speeds.
 l Link rural Idaho to global marketplaces.
 l Connect health care and first responders.
 l Identify funding and partnership models.
 l Convene partners.
 These are lofty goals that face many challenges.
 They are goals the Legislature must get behind, particularly when it comes to funding. The commitment to serving all of Idaho must be made. Finding federal monies, grants and corporate sponsors are imperative to make this happen.
 The state needs a full-time office working on this until it’s done. The payoff to the state and its citizens will be much more than the office will cost. But without full-time attention to this matter, it will not happen.
 It doesn’t matter if you are a logger in the backwoods, a farmer somewhere in the rural Palouse hills, a small, home-based business or a student; you need the internet.
 Today, it makes the difference between success and failure. Idaho cannot take chances with our children by not giving them the best shot we can and that includes their ability to learn. We don’t know how long it may be before our kids will go back to school on a full-time, permanent basis. It could be a couple of years. Computer learning will be the “new normal.”
 Without the access they need to the internet and their teachers, students will not have the tools they need to succeed.
 This election season, it is important to keep your eyes on the ball. The future of our kids is at stake. Make sure you express to your legislators your support for the expansion of broadband internet across all of Idaho.

The New York Yankees placed a high-grade hitter on the injured list for the third time this week when they shelved infielder DJ LeMahieu on Sunday because of a sprained left thumb. (The Yankees recalled Miguel Andujar in a corresponding move.) Previously, the Yankees had deactivated Giancarlo Stanton (hamstring) and Aaron Judge (strained calf), leaving them without their three most productive hitters this season, as determined by OPS+.
 In addition to giving the Yankees' injured list a fearsome heart-of-the-order, LeMahieu's inclusion serves to give New York fans a feeling of deja vu. Remember, the Yankees lost 1,000 more days to injury than any other team last season, according to Spotrac. Things aren't quite as dire right now, but the Yankees will be without some key contributors for the time being. In addition to the above names, the Yankees have lost Luis Severino and Tommy Kahnle to Tommy John surgery, and haven't yet seen closer Aroldis Chapman return from his bout with COVID-19.
 To think, the Yankees used the three-month delay caused by the pandemic to heal up. Had the season opened in March as planned, the Yankees might have entered the year without Stanton, Judge, Aaron Hicks, and James Paxton.

Lionel Messi wants out at Barcelona following their 8-2 loss to Bayern Munich in the Champions League quarterfinals, according to journalist Marcelo Bechler.

 That will put clubs with the biggest financial resources -- such as Manchester City, PSG and Juventus -- on high alert.

NEW YORK) -- Iran has decided to pre-sell the country's oil, the main source of the Islamic Republic's income, to its citizens by offering oil bonds and the government has said it intends to put the oil on the stock market in the framework of an "economic breakthrough".      The chief of staff of the president of Iran Mahmoud Vaezi said in a rare comment that anyone who "can buy as many as 50,000 to 100,000 barrels of oil on the energy stock market could get a small ship and export it."      Officials say it is an attempt to overcome the budget deficit the government faces amid the suffocating sanctions imposed on the country by the U.S. as well as the economic impact that country has faced over the coronavirus pandemic.      Iranian President Hassan Rouhani promoted the plan in a session with his cabinet members on Wednesday saying that it is "a safe investment for the people" instead of investing in the gold and foreign currency market.      The president described the plan of domestic sale of oil as a sample of a "people-centered economy" and an effective measure to organize the capital and stock exchange market which is an "important step to counter the enemies' oil embargo," as Tasnim News Agency reported on Tuesday.      The U.S. economic sanctions, widespread corruption and domestic mismanagement have pushed Iranians over the years to invest in gold and hard currency in order to protect their money against the devaluation of their national currency and high inflation.      The withdrawal of the United States from the Iran nuclear deal in May 2018 led to the devaluation of rial, Iran's national currency.      The deal had aimed to ease economic sanctions on Iran in return for Tehran's commitment to curb its nuclear programs but when the U.S. pulled out of the deal and resumed economic sanctions, Iran's already ailing economy was badly affected.      The complex economic conditions of the country has made the selling of oil on the international market a Herculean task and experts say they are suspicious about the long-term success of the oil preselling plan.      "I have never heard of any other top oil exporters taking such a move," said Iranian economist Mousa Ghaninejad to ABC News.      Ghaninejad says that while selling bonds is a standard tool that a government can use to help with a budget's deficit, he does not see it as a viable option for Iran given the current circumstances.      "It sounds like there are people in the administration who want to reinvent the wheel from scratch. It is not how the global economy works" he added, saying the plan is "vague and unclear."      The head of the energy stock market Ali Hosseini clarified that the pre-sale of oil bonds, set to be offered on the market as of Sunday, are different from President Rouhani's "economic breakthrough" plan.      "These bonds are offered based on the National Oil Company procedure of selling bonds ... They are two-year bonds with an interest rate of around 19%," Hosseini said in an interview with the Islamic Republic News Agency on Friday.      "The president's plan will be announced once it is finalized regarding the legal requirements and executive regulations," he added.      However, Ghaninejad said that the two-year bonds being sold are not the most sensible option for most people.      "With an inflation rate of around 50%, no wise business person would buy a two-year bond with 19% interest rate. It means they have to bear around 30% of negative interest," he said. "If the government mandates the banks to buy the bonds and shares, then the banks have to borrow money from the Central Bank to compensate for their loss in the coming years, which means more inflation rate," Ghaninejad explained.      But, supporters of the oil pre-selling scheme, including the head of the Central Bank Abdolnaser Hemmati, say the country is running out of options to make up for the budget deficit amid sanctions.      Hemmati wrote in an Instagram post on Wednesday that the government has four methods to remedy the deficit: "reducing expenses, increasing tax revenues, selling government shares and assets, and issuing bonds or pre-selling sanctioned goods such as crude oil."      Claiming that the first three solutions are not possible due to the coronavirus pandemic, he believes issuing bonds and pre-selling oil on the stock market is the preferred option as the bonds are "less costly and more manageable for the government."      Across the political aisle, parliamentarians with conservative party affiliations who are long-standing political rival of President Rouhani have criticized the government's oil pre-sell plan in the stock market over the possible long-term consequences on inflation.      The Energy Committee of the parliament submitted a letter to the parliament speaker asking him to warn the government about its hasty decisions, as Mehr News reported on Wednesday.      Rouhani's administration plans to start pre-selling the oil on the stock market beginning today.      Copyright (C) 2020, ABC Audio. All rights reserved

Angels shortstop David Fletcher added another web gem to his growing 2020 defensive highlight reel Saturday night with a play that manager Joe Maddon called one of the best he’s ever seen.


  In the fourth inning of the Dodgers’ 6-5, 10-inning victory at Angel Stadium, Fletcher ranged about 20 feet to his right and onto the outfield grass to make a backhand stab of a ground ball hit by Mookie Betts.


  Then, in virtually one motion and with his momentum carrying him toward left field, Fletcher lofted an off-balance throw of about 150 feet to first base to nail Betts for the out, a close call that was upheld by replay.


  “Honestly, everybody’s into hyperbole, but that one there, I don’t know if I’ve seen that one,” Maddon said. “My comment in the dugout was, normally a shortstop has to jump on that play, plant his foot and somehow … you know, you’ve seen Derek Jeter do it a thousand times, and others.

MOUNDS, IL — State police say a law enforcement vehicle pursuit ended in a crash that left one person dead and three others injured early Sunday morning.
 Illinois State Police investigators say an Alexander County Sheriff's Office deputy tried to stop a 2011 Ford Fusion around 2:12 a.m. Sunday due to a traffic violation, but the driver did not stop the car.
