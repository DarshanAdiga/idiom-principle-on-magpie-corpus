WHITEMAN AIR FORCE BASE – While uncertainty looms during the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, one military couple at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, took the opportunity to lend a helping hand and support others.
 U.S. Air Force Capts. Lauren and Ben Kram, 393rd Bomb Squadron pilots, devoted hundreds of hours to making and donating masks for their squadron and people around the U.S.
 "Working from home only goes so far for pilots, so with the extra free time, I wanted to do something that would help others during this pandemic," Lauren said. "I heard about people making fabric masks and donating them to hospitals, so I went to the store and picked up a few bright fabrics, and pulled out the sewing machine that's only been used to sew on military ranks and velcro."
 Lauren used several resources, like YouTube and hospital websites, to create and design the masks.
 "The design we made was referenced from a hospital website as appropriate for hospital donations," Lauren said. "I wanted to make sure the masks I made wouldn't be turned away when I donated them."
 Inspired by his wife's passion for helping and work ethic, Ben decided to join in her efforts.
 "Lauren was doing an awesome job and working hard, and as demand increased I knew she could use the help," Ben said. "I asked her to teach me how to sew, so that I could start helping her make masks and support the fight against COVID-19."
 Initially, the couple's project started with a batch of masks they created and donated to the Western Missouri Medical Center. However, demand for her masks escalated when the Department of Defense mandated mask-wearing.
 "Our commander forwarded the DoD guidance to everyone in our squadron, and since I was already in the process of making them for WMMC, we volunteered," Lauren said. "That was Sunday evening. By 3 a.m. that next morning, I had made enough masks for all of the pilots in our squadron who were flying that week."
 Due to limited space available in the B-2 Spirit, T-38 Talon and the simulators, abiding by the 6 feet of social distancing guidelines proved difficult for the pilots.
 The Kram’s mask-making efforts helped to ensure the flying force stayed healthy and there was no break in training or flying for the squadron.
 As other squadrons around base started hearing about the Kram’s masks, requests started pouring in.
 “We provided a majority of the masks for the 393rd BS and 13th BS, and a smaller amount for the 509th Operation Support Squadron, 509th Security Forces Squadron, and the 20th Attack Squadron,” Lauren said.
 Lauren said production was slow at first, but with the support of the community the pair was able to quickly pick up the pace.
 "There were a bunch of neighbors and coworkers who donated elastic bands, hairbands and hair ties they had laying around the house, which was a huge help," Lauren said. "Almost everyone has donated money or resources to help with costs of supplies, which really helped since demand had more than doubled the cost of supplies."
 Once everyone in the squadrons received a mask, the Kram’s began to look elsewhere to further their donation efforts.
 "We started making masks for families," Ben said. "The transmission of COVID-19 slows down if more people wear masks, so the more people we can get masks to, the better it is for everyone."
 While the masks the Kram’s make are designed to keep people safe, Lauren said she hopes they will also help lift people’s spirits.
 "Everyone is much more isolated right now," Lauren said. "We don't have the usual face to face interactions that a lot of us need, so we hope these masks provide some sense of encouragement."
 U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Rob Schoeneberg, the 393rd Bomb Squadron commander, praised the Krams for manufacturing masks for their squadron and many others throughout Whiteman AFB.
 “Our mission at Whiteman is absolutely critical and the 393rd would have continued to operate without the creative efforts of the Krams,” Schoeneberg said. “However, their ingenuity and selflessness inspired others to do the same. It created awareness and highlighted the need for techniques to mitigate COVID-19 and it ultimately resulted in ensuring that the health and combat readiness of the 393rd Bomb Squadron was not compromised.”
 Lauren and Ben continue to make masks for members of Team Whiteman and to others across the country.
 Collectively, the Krams have donated more than 500 masks to friends and family, military bases, hospitals and nursing homes all over the U.S. in hopes of flattening the curve, keeping people safe and lifting spirits.

Re “After pandemic, will colleges ever be the same again?” (May 15): A recent editorial posed this provocative question. From my experience as a board trustee overseeing San Diego’s community college system, I can only say that I certainly hope so. I hope that our colleges can return to delivering educational programs through a broad mix of in-person and online instruction and that our campuses can return to the time when they served as stimulating environments that allow students, educators and the community to interact, study and learn.
 Students interacting with their professors and fellow students in a classroom gives them a depth of learning and deeper opportunities for critical thinking that cannot be achieved through a computer screen alone. Classroom interaction can never be duplicated online where students can become invisible. Working online from home, students face the challenges in hectic environments where life’s distractions can destroy concentration on learning.
 I hope that we can return to a time when college campuses are alive with activity and learning. I hope that we can return to a time when the actual classrooms and online learning are both options for students, when science labs are open, when student clubs are meeting, and when counselors are helping students in person, when libraries are packed with students and when our cafeterias are busy with students catching lunch together.
 Higher education will evolve after the pandemic but let’s hope that the full college experience can be saved for today’s students and students into the future.

The mineral portion consists of clay, silt, sand and gravel/rock particles. The proportion of each determines many soil properties, such as water holding capability and tendency to compact. Here’s a visual comparison of the three particle sizes; sand is a basketball, silt is a ping pong ball and clay is pea size. Sand particles, due to their larger size, allow for more air spaces, do not compact readily, or hold water as well as soils made of silt or clay. Silty soils have smaller air pockets and hold water better than sandy soils. Clay particles are the smallest and can readily compact, driving oxygen out of the soil.

When COVID hit, it seemed home improvement centers started seeing a resurgence. It was as if people needed to stay busy while quarantined and home upgrades are one way to do so.
 But whatever time or reason upgrades are made, challenges await at each turn.
 Our recent goal to put up a new ceiling in our patio led to what some might consider a comical rerun for the "Home Improvement" television sitcom.
 While taking down boards, we managed to ruin two screens. Once lattice was put up so our roof could "breathe," we decided to power wash the wood so we could paint it. That led to millions of white specks of old paint everywhere and a dirty lattice ceiling.
 Next in the saga was cutting the screens short, thus necessitating multiple trips to the local hardware store for more screen material and trim. So what was supposed to take an afternoon is an ongoing process. And, all that's being done while trying to paint and reassemble a picnic table!
 The whole ordeal reminded me of numerous escapades my husband and I have been thrust into - as if being in a sitcom nightmare causing hilarious laughter. How soon we forget until the next project rolls around.
 One year before the holidays beset, we got into a swivet to improve the domicile for visitors. After painting our living room, we again discovered that one job always leads to the next. In other words, changing one thing may require tackling additional tasks to complete the intended task.
 Originally, we decided to add a new coat of paint, but painting led to ceiling molding, which led to new drapes, which required painting the front door.
 When telling our story, we found out we're not alone when it comes to ongoing upgrades. A brother-in-law started with finishing wood floors, which led to a mess. He learned that when two people put down varnish, typically one person puts it on heavier, leading to streaks and longer drying time for the thicker application.
 They then decided to paint doors, removing the hardware and setting it aside together in a pile. When paint and varnish had dried and it was time to rehang the doors, issues surfaced. Doors that previously worked flawlessly now would not close or would swing open when not latched. The funny thing is, even when switching the hardware around numerous times, the exact match could never be determined.
 But let's not forget to mention that when painting the walls before finishing the floor, paint was spilled all over the wall, through the baseboards onto the unfinished floor, soaking into the pores after newly sanding the floor. All this really makes you want to get started on that next project, doesn't it?
 When it comes to exterior remodeling improvements, many homeowners are reluctant to start in the cooler months because they worry about the potential to let in a draft during the installation process.
 In reality, this is one of the times of year you will most feel the impact of an upgrade to energy-efficient windows, doors and insulated siding, and the remodeling can be done, it's promised, "with minimal impact on the comfort of your home."
 The trick is finding the one or two odd days of the month where there are unseasonably warm temperatures to allow the outside work to get done. Lately, it seems spring showers have dominated any ability to do outside work. Checking forecasts a week in advance and then choosing the one day it's not pouring is the tricky part.
 When it is cold outside, something as simple as hanging lights on the house for example, is never really simple. Already up on a ladder, guess what needs to be done? Cleaning gutters, of course. This leads to picking stray leaves out of bushes before decking them with lights and then raking up the last of the infamous leaves that have blown in and found their way under the bushes.
 On the bright side, by the time the initial project is done, a handful of other tasks have also been accomplished - eventually.

“The why gets asked a lot,” he said. “They want to know why you’re doing things, and you have to have the answers for that.”
 It’s tempting to suggest O’Connell is on the head-coach track, in light of McVay’s former offensive coordinators Matt LaFleur and Zac Taylor having taken over the Packers and Bengals, respectively, after the 2018 Rams reached the Super Bowl.
 First things first. Will a few Rams’ blockers emerge as reliable? The 2018 Rams had a terrific offensive line, as did the 2017 team that led the NFL in scoring (and also had a dominant running back in Todd Gurley, now with the Falcons). Goff was comfortable, posting passer ratings of 100-plus in those two seasons before falling to 86.5 last year while throwing a league-high 626 passes.
 If Goff could run nearly as fast as O’Connell did — he holds several Aztecs rushing records for a quarterback and clocked a 4.61 in the 40-yard dash — the line’s limitations would matter less. Even so, Goff is above average at other tasks that are more important, such as reading defenses and throwing where he aims.

The Big Ten's Kevin Warren, the first black commissioner of a Power Five conference, is creating a coalition to give the league's athletes a platform to voice their concerns about racism.
   
 Warren announced Monday the formation of the Big Ten Anti-Hate and Anti-Racism Coalition, with athletes, coaches, athletic director and university chancellors and presidents.
   
 Warren said the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis while being detained by police motivated him to take action beyond merely putting out a statement decrying racism.
   
 "This has to stop. We have to build better relationships with law enforcement. They have to be trained better," Warren told AP. "But it has to stop. And we just need to do what we can at every and any level to eliminate hate, to eliminate racism. We're going to take a stance on it in the Big Ten. I'm personally invested in this."
   
 Warren also said he and his wife, Greta, will be donating $100,000 to the National Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights.
   
 It was one year ago Tuesday, that Warren, a former NFL executive with the Minnesota Vikings, was offered the job of Big Ten commissioner. He officially took over for former commissioner Jim Delany in January and has been dealing with crises in college sports ever since, starting with a pandemic that forced the cancellation of the NCAA basketball tournament and the rest of spring sports.
   
 Schools are beginning to bring athletes back to campus for voluntary workouts. The NCAA gave the go-ahead for schools to start that process on on June 1, providing hope that football season will go on as scheduled.
   
 "These next 30 to 40 days are going to be critical," Warren said. "But I am very a positive person. I'm cautiously optimistic as fall as sports are concerned. But every single day, starting today in the month of June and the first part of July, will be will be critical for us to truly understand all the health and safety issues that will help us make a proper decision as we go into the fall."
   
 While the Big 12, Pac-12 and Southeastern Conferences have set specific dates when those voluntary athletic activities can begin, the Big Ten -- which spans from Rutgers in New Jersey to Nebraska -- has left it up to each school to determine when is best to re-start.
   
 "I trust our chancellors, our presidents and our athletic directors and our coaches and our student-athletes," Warren said. "I trust our people on our campus that they're going to do the right thing, that they will always put the health and wellness and safety of our student athletes front and center."
   
 Protests against police violence against minorities have swept across the country following Floyd's death. Warren said he felt a responsibility to 10,000 student athletes in the Big Ten to try to combat systemic racism.
   
 "I may look back over my career, my entire career, and forming this coalition and the work that comes out of it could end up having the biggest impact on society than anything else I've ever done," Warren said.

Ukrainian football club Karpaty Lviv has been placed in quarantine after 25 people among the players and staff tested positive for the coronavirus, the country’s Premier League said Tuesday.
 All those infected have self-isolated while the club was “put in quarantine for at least two weeks,” the league said in a statement. Training has been suspended.
 The next two games for the Lviv side, scheduled for mid-June, have been cancelled. Karpaty said that 65 people were tested for the coronavirus, and urged other clubs to view testing of its players and staff with “utmost responsibility.”
 A game set for last Sunday between Karpaty and Lviv had been cancelled after the first positive test results came back. A sports official told AFP that most of those who have the coronavirus have “no symptoms”.
 Ukrainian football matches restarted last weekend behind closed doors, as part of easing of the virus lockdown. Ukraine on Tuesday registered a total of 24,340 cases of the coronavirus, and 727 people died from the illness.

First things first, our military is the undisputed heavyweight — back-to-back World War champ. America’s superiority on the battlefield will remain unmatched, even in the face of the coronavirus. Writing for Forbes, Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, rightly says, “Wartime capabilities will be unaffected (by the virus) ... authorities would accept the risk of infection and order troops to deploy.”
 I share this belief. The Army will roll along, the Marines will fight from the halls to the shores, and the Space Force will do whatever the Space Force does (tongue in cheek).
 Yet the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) is fighting daily to corral and mitigate the impact of the virus on military personnel and their families. Replying to my request for comment, Lt. Col. Chris Mitchell, a spokesman for the department, told me in unequivocal terms that deployments have been affected, including cancellations and extensions of (upcoming) deployments. According to Mitchell, “The Defense Department has taken a number of measures to protect our military community,” including canceling official travel and changes to duty stations.
 Material in the public domain and medical details about our troops are scant; however, we know DOD reports deaths of two service members, five dependents, nine contractors and 16 civilians; troops and their families are sheltered in place; and sailors aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt shocked the world when they disembarked in the Pacific theater during a rising Cold War with China.

The NCAA announced Wednesday it will lift restrictions for on-campus activities June 1, although that won’t change San Diego State’s announced time frame for bringing athletes back to Montezuma Mesa.

 “My hope is that we’ll have a good working plan by the end of the month that we could then vet,” Wicker said in an interview this week. “If we say July 7, it will be (mid- to late-June) when we have to really pull the trigger on ‘yes, you’re going to be able to come back.’
 “So we’ve got some time to finish putting the plan together and really work through it and figure out if there’s any issues that we’ve created with the plan we have.”

It is not only China and Russia that are challenging the United States. Across the Middle East, there is a sense that Trump’s oft-expressed desire to withdraw from the region — along with his National Security Strategy’s focus on a renewed competition among superpowers — offers new leeway.
 Iran has bet that Trump, for all his emphasis on doubling down on sanctions as he completes America’s exit from the 2015 nuclear deal, is not willing to risk outright confrontation. Tehran has gradually accelerated its production of nuclear fuel and ignored requests from international inspectors for access to suspected nuclear-related sites. But it has not raced ahead, perhaps calculating that a slow rebuilding of its stockpiles will not result in a strong international backlash.
 And in the Persian Gulf, even after the U.S.-led killing in January of Qassem Soleimani, a senior commander in Iran’s Revolutionary Guard and Iran’s terrorism mastermind, Tehran is episodically testing America’s limits.
 Nearly a dozen Iranian fast boats conducted what the Navy described as “dangerous and harassing approaches” to six U.S. warships in the Persian Gulf in mid-April, prompting Trump’s order “to shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats if they harass our ships at sea.” Iran backed off in the gulf — but then stepped up oil shipments to Venezuela, in a challenge to the U.S.-led embargo meant to displace President Nicolás Maduro, who has stayed in office despite a vigorous U.S. campaign to force him out.
 In mid-May, Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said U.S. attempts to disrupt the course of Iranian tankers carrying fuel for Venezuela were “dangerous” and “provocative” acts. Iran has threatened retaliation against U.S. forces in the gulf and throughout the Middle East if Washington interferes with Tehran’s oil deliveries.

At a time of national anger over police killings, hundreds of Sonoma County residents came together in Roseland to remember Andy Lopez, the 13-year-old Santa Rosa boy who was shot and killed by a sheriff’s deputy in 2013.
 “Today would’ve been his 20th birthday, and at the height of all of this public outrage, it’s important to still remember him and say his name,” said Raina Pope, a 25-year-old Sebastopol resident who attended the vigil. The event started about 5 p.m. in the parking lot of the Dollar Tree on Sebastopol Road and lasted about two hours.
 Lopez was fatally shot along Moorland Avenue in southwest Santa Rosa on Oct. 22, 2013, by then-deputy Erick Gelhaus, who mistook Lopez’s airsoft BB gun for a real AK-47 assault rifle, which it was designed to resemble.
 The Sonoma County District Attorney’s Office cleared Gelhaus of criminal wrongdoing, and he was later promoted to sergeant before retiring last year.
 Lopez’s family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Sonoma County in 2013 and settled for $3 million in 2018.
 The vigil came amid a series of local demonstrations against police violence that began Saturday night over the death of George Floyd.
 Floyd was a 46-year-old black man who died on Memorial Day when a white Minneapolis police officer held him face down on the street with a knee on the back of his neck while arresting him. His death has prompted days of protest in Minneapolis that have spread to cities around the country.
 The vigil, organized by the Police Brutality Coalition of Sonoma County, began with a moment of silence for Lopez. Susan Lamont — a longtime activist and lead organizer for the event — invited people to come up to the microphone and speak to the crowd of about 500 people. Several people held signs that said, “Justice Now,” “Black Lives Matter” and “End White Silence.”
 Many spoke about Lopez and other people of color, including Floyd, who have been killed by law enforcement officers elsewhere in the country.
 “This is about coming together,” Lamont said. “(People) are here because they’re mourning some loss.”
 Nayeli Calles, a 17-year-old Santa Rosa resident, came to the vigil with a portrait she painted of Lopez. While Calles spoke to the crowd, a woman nearby held it up as people applauded and cheered.
 “It has my tears on it because of the amount of hurt I feel,” Calles told the crowd.
 Through her tears, Calles said she was “terrified” for her two younger brothers, who live in Mexico, to come to this country and face racism and discrimination. She has participated in every protest since Saturday because she felt “the need” to show solidarity.
 “I just want the whole police department to just really listen to us,” she said later. “We’re angry for a reason.”
 Before Tuesday’s vigil, Santa Rosa Councilman Ernesto Olivares said he hoped the community would be able to have difficult conversations about systemic community problems at forums that allowed for serious, nuanced discussion. He noted the need to implement more of the reforms recommended after Lopez’s death and said it’s imperative to engage youth like those who have filled out the ranks of the local protests.

Lawn tennis, like every other sport, requires a lot of practice. You cannot sit back on your couch, read about strategies, and dream of becoming better. You need to get on the field and practice as much you can. Plus, you must also lead a disciplined life. A sportsperson cannot afford to throw caution to the wind and start living a life with no restrain and order. You must pay attention to your diet, your sleep cycle, and your exercise regime.

Sexual and physical abuse most often occurs when the offending person has access and opportunity. A perfect storm — of sheltering in place, job layoffs, school closures, physical distancing and fewer personal interactions — have all but guaranteed children are forced to spend more time isolated with their abusers. A child’s ability to escape, if only for a moment, to safely communicate her or his circumstances to a trusted person, such as a teacher, relative or friend, is temporarily not an option. For at-risk children throughout the United States who are quarantined at home, their risk of abuse is much greater than the risk that isolated them. And that is newsworthy.
 As a child abuse detective, I have conducted hundreds of physical and sexual abuse investigations involving children. My professional experience has affirmed what the research has shown — children are most often abused by someone they know and are usually reluctant to disclose their abuse. There are numerous reasons for this, to include the conflicted feelings of shame, guilt and even love for their abuser, or more sinister reasons, such as threats of physical harm to the child. Despite the many complex barriers children face when considering who and when to tell, the vast majority of children whose cases I have investigated expressed an overwhelming sense of relief once someone found out and intervened on their behalf.

Laura Crocco Shaw   October 9, 1921 - May 29,2020   Laura Crocco Shaw was born in Stockton, California on October 9, 1921. She was the youngest daughter of Angelo Crocco and Rose Bernini Crocco. Raised on the family farm in Knightsen, she attended Knightsen Elementary school and Liberty Union High School where she participated in academic clubs and high school sports. Graduating in 1939, Laura attended Stockton Business College where she graduated with a degree in Secretarial Administration.   Laura moved to Martinez, California where she soon fell in with a group of amazing young women. She met her best friend, Harriet Jackson Pistochini, and the two of them remained exactly that until Harriet's death in 2018. They raised their children together and we remain family to this day.   Laura began her banking career as an Executive Secretary at the Bank of America in Martinez in 1941. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the men were sent to war and the women stepped up. She moved into the Administrative area of banking where she remained until she retired at the age of 70 as an Executive Vice President for Lafayette Federal Savings.   During this time, Laura met and married John Shaw, a returning Army   Veteran of WW2. They raise two children, Leslie and John, in Pleasant Hill, California.   Retirement did not suit her. She went to work part-time first for Bank of the West and then for CitiBank, spending the next 8 years fending off their offers to move her into management. She finally retired from banking in at the age of 78.   In 1998 Laura sold the family home in Pleasant Hill and moved to Modesto, where her late father's family had put down roots 100 years earlier. Laura moved to Modesto specifically to help her son John with child care for he had blessed her with two handsome grandsons, Ryan and Stephen, and a beautiful granddaughter, Jillian Rose. Her daughter Leslie came with her and together they created a home in Modesto that was centered around God, Family and Football. She embraced her new life and enjoyed every single minute with her tribe.   Sundays were spent first praying the Holy Mass at St. Joseph's Parish and then watching her beloved San Francisco Forty-Niners play the game she had loved since she listened to it on the radio at 'The Ranch'. Faithful since 1946, she coached from the couch regularly firing staff and benching players. Her favorite players of all time were Joe Montana and Dwight Clark, though she thinks that George Kittle and Kwon Alexander aren't half bad.   Laura is survived by her daughter, Leslie Shaw Klinger, OP of Modesto and her son John S. Shaw (Crissie) of Oakdale. She is also survived by her grandchildren Ryan, Stephen and Jillian Rose, her nephews George Arata Sr. (Marla) of Modesto and Dewey Mansfield (Lorna) of Eugene, Oregon, her 'other sons' Greg Peter Pistochini (Brian) of Healdsburg, Ca and Mark Pistochini (Deirdre) of Virginia. Laura is also survived by the mother of her grandchildren whom she dearly loved, Pamela Miller Shaw.   Laura has numerous nephews and nieces in Oregon, Colorado, Wyoming, Maryland, Boston and Texas. She particularly looked forward to her visits with her Niece Natalie Rose (Gordon) in the summer and had hoped to cheer Natalie on as she attempts to swim the English Channel next year.   Mama loved all her family members. She will now be of great support to them from her powerful position before the throne of the Most High, Jesus Christ.   She was preceded in death by her husband John, her parents, her siblings Irene, Della, Jeanne and Jerry and son-in-law Fred and daughter-in-law Lisa.   Laura never got the chance to personally thank Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith for the peace of mind those two men gave her as a result of their collaboration. However, there is no doubt that when she arrived in heaven she sought them out in order to do so.   In lieu of flowers, Laura would like people to consider supporting the Religious Education Department at St Joseph's Catholic Church in Modesto, California or the Stockton Animal Shelter where she met her buddy, Shaw's Rob Roy MacDuff.   Services will be private as a result of the current pandemic. Please keep her in prayer, as she will you.   www.cvobituaries.com

For District 3, Ken Baughman, Corine Frank and Larry Rogers ran for the seat. By late Tuesday, Frank received the largest percentage in the number of votes by mail with 48%. Baughman was behind with nearly 30% and Rogers had 22%.
 District 2 only had two candidates, Robert A. Silkworth and Raleigh Turnage Jr., and they both move on to the General Election.
 For the Anne Arundel Board of Education, three more districts have opened up for elected members — District 2, District 3 and District 6 — as the school board moves away from an appointed body. The top two candidates in each district will move on to a runoff in November.
 In total 10 candidates were in the running for the school board. The primaries marked a historic election for another reason beyond the health guidelines put into place to combat COVID-19. The school board is transitioning from governor-appointed to a fully elected body.
 So far, the school board is made up of four elected board members, Candace Antwine of District 1, Melissa Ellis of District 4, Dana Schallheim, of District 5, and Michelle Corkadel of District 7. They will serve six-year terms.

And Dr. David Eisenman, director of the Center for Public Health and Disasters at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, said he feared partisan forces might accuse cities of bringing fresh cases on themselves.
 “I’m actually more worried about how, if those spikes occur, how that information will be weaponized against the notion of protests,” he said.
 Eisenman called protesting an “essential activity,” possible to practice with reduced risk. He said his grown children protested in Los Angeles and are taking safety precautions now, including isolating themselves at home. They plan to get tested for COVID-19 in about a week.
 Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University, said the hospitalizations for coronavirus in the Washington metro area have been on the decline but that she knows that could change.
 “There are a lot of unknowns about what happens next,” she said.
 Wen was the health commissioner for the city of Baltimore during the 2015 uprising after the death of Freddie Gray in police custody and said many health clinics were closed and pharmacies burned down, making it difficult for members of disadvantaged communities to access health care.
 It’s a concern for her now, too.
 “You will have compounded health issues that go beyond COVID-19,” she said.
 Public health experts said it will take two to three weeks to know whether the protests cause a surge in coronavirus cases. And even then, they can’t definitively tie it to the demonstrations.
 The unrest is happening in tandem with the reopening of gyms, hair salons, restaurants, parks and beaches. It also comes on the heels of the Memorial Day weekend, when many people attended large gatherings, so experts already were bracing for a case increase, said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University.
 In Los Angeles, barbershops and in-person dining were allowed to resume last weekend, just as protests descended into destruction and more than 1,000 people were arrested. Nearly 10,000 new cases have been reported in Los Angeles County in the past week.

“The Museum has never been closed longer than three days, much less for three months or more — during which we have lost all revenue sources,” Kenneth Weine, a spokesman, said in a statement. “The financial impact of the pandemic is extraordinary, and we are accessing all possible means to work through this crisis.”
 The Association of Art Museum Directors acknowledged the difficult situation in April when it relaxed its guidelines on endowment spending. While it is not recommending that museums dip further, the association’s board adopted a resolution that says it will not censure museums if they redirect income earned off invested endowment funds from restricted sources to general operations.
 The New York state attorney general’s office, which recommends against endowment draws that exceed 7%, is also considering issuing new guidance to let nonprofits know state officials recognize that there is pressure to dip deeper.
 John MacIntosh, managing partner of SeaChange Capital Partners, an organization that supports nonprofits, said many organizations are, at the least, discussing the prospect of employing endowment money in a more active way, short term.
 “I certainly think that it’s widespread and it should be,” he said.
 In fact, part of the ongoing debate is whether endowment preservation is too fusty a principle at a time when some organizations are fighting for their very survival and the human costs of the pandemic are evident in massive layoffs and furloughs.
 “This should not be happening. The board of this museum, the endowment, the assets in its warehouses that never see the light of day — all capable of making this shortfall and keeping those people employed,” was one reaction on Twitter, by Jonathan T.D. Neil, the director of Claremont Graduate University’s Center for Business & Management of the Arts, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s decision to lay off some museum staff.
 But even those who are accessing endowment funds in ways they have never done before consider these funds to be critical bulwarks to their organizations and plan to only increase their spending temporarily.
 “This is unprecedented, like so many things during this crisis,” said David Gordon, a former director of the Milwaukee Art Museum who consults with cultural institutions. “There has been for quite a while an emphasis on building up the endowments so there will be a great reluctance to dip into them.”
 The board of trustees at Carnegie Hall is still deciding how to deal with its $8 million budget deficit caused by the pandemic, said Clive Gillinson, its executive and artistic director. Increasing the amount taken from the roughly $300 million endowment this year is on the table, Gillinson said, but he considers that to be a “radical approach.” “You have to be careful that what you’re doing helps sustain the long term as well as dealing with short-term issues,” he said.
 So far, the arts groups more inclined to reach further into the endowment have been performing arts organizations, many of which rely on ticket revenue for a greater portion of their operating expenses than museums rely on admissions. Although the American Alliance of Museums estimates that the 35,000 museums in the United States are, all told, losing a staggering $33 million a day, Laura Lott, president and chief executive, said she had not yet seen any dip into endowment principal.

As for going back to bars, restaurants, etc., I will go back right away, but with a cautious eye. I want to trust all businesses to do the right thing and take no shortcuts in opening up, but if I didn’t think the business was being careful, then I would not return and may even leave at that time if I was uncomfortable.
 As someone who has been asked to help set the procedures for another business that may open back up in the future, I take the safety of all those who will be coming through those doors extremely seriously, so I will be observing both the good and the bad going on during this time.
 But in the end, I trust local businesses to do the right thing.
 What might keep me from charging through the doors to these establishments is the fact that I don’t trust the public at large to do the right thing. Too many without masks and the pent-up “We need to be normal” out there right now.

 At 18 months old, they’re getting to the age where they have each other to play with. When the twins were born, their big sister was four.

The life of a sportsperson has a siren call to it. Let us just state it outright- we have all been fascinated by the larger than life lifestyle and attention that sportspeople live through. The brands they endorse, the fame they enjoy, have all inspired awe in us. Plus, the respect that comes along when they represent their country in international leagues is a whole different feeling. Therefore, it is not much of a surprise if children harbor a dream of pursuing a sports career. Schools and educational institutions of sorts of many countries also have a provision where they train their students in the sports of their liking, and ones in which they exhibit potential. Speaking of which, one sport that youngsters aspire to take up as their career is that of lawn tennis. Lawn tennis is a luxurious sport that comes with a fashion statement of its own. And this quotient has a magnetic pull that has been drawing people to itself since eons. However, if you are one of those people who aspire to become a lawn tennis player just for the royalty that it has to offer, you must understand that there are several other dimensions that you must factor in before you take up this sport. We shall go into the details of these factors in the subsequent sections. Read through them all to make a better decision about your sports career.

In my book _Eternal Hostility: The Struggle Between Theocracy and Democracy_ , I discuss Rushdoony’s rationale for the righteous lie. Rahab is a lauded figure in much of the Jewish and Christian tradition. She hid two Israelite military spies in her home during the siege of the Canaanite city of Jericho by the army of Joshua—and lied to Canaanite soldiers who were searching for the spies. For her service, she and her family were spared when Joshua sacked the city and massacred everyone in it. There are a variety of understandings of the meaning of Rahab’s acts—like just about any other biblical figure. But Rushdoony’s interpretation is foundational for the contemporary Christian Right.

Although he questioned the severity of the COVID-19 virus, Facinelli did say the possibility of a tourist bringing the disease to Cody concerns him.
 “All it takes is one person coming in,” he said.
 Thompson also said a variance has been submitted for the Stampede parade, which Deti said Harrist has received but not acted on yet.
 A "Time to Fight for Rodeo" petition was made on Change.org by Nikki Tate on Thursday, for people to show support for CNR and signing of the variance. As of 10:45 a.m. Monday morning, more than 10,375 people had signed it.
 Although he did not take responsibility for making the final decision to cancel the Stampede or the state’s five other largest rodeos, Gordon did say his health restrictions came into significant play.
 “At this job I take a lot of arrows. We wanted to make sure events were handled safely,” he said. “Others felt like it was not possible to do.”
 Gordon said the Hulett, Wyoming Rodeo is still on in mid-June and the Forever West Professional Bull Riders event Sheridan last weekend ran but was closed to the public.
 “We’re trying to have a rodeo, at least a Nite Rodeo,” Facinelli said.
 The Stampede Board will make an announcement soon about the official plan for Nite Rodeo. Thompson also said Friday morning the Stampede is not yet cancelled and the Board is working on an exemption request for this event.
 He said for this event to run, it would be dependent on approval and the requirements mandated by Harrist.
 Tate said he is unsure about when the nightly rodeo will begin, but he said they will still push for it to happen.
 “We’re planning on doing a Nite Rodeo, whether it’s on the (June) 15, (July) 1, or whatever. We’re planning to go ahead with it,” Tate said. “We’re determined to have it whether we’re allowed to have 200 or 2,000 people there.”
 Tate is still in his native Apache, Okla., waiting for the official green light to make his way to Cody, but said he would need less than two weeks to adequately prepare for the Nite Rodeo production.
 “We’re getting pretty close to that,” he said with a chuckle. “This thing’s a mess.”

I understand when you go to a bar or restaurant on a Saturday night that the cleaning factor is not going to be 100%, but that doesn’t mean I have to sit in someone else’s filth. Now that there is a respiratory virus going around that can be spread by human contact, these kinds of places need to held accountable for making sure their customers can feel safe being in their establishments and not go home with someone else’s illness.
 I’ve never had a problem at a salon. Hair, waxing and nail salons have always been clean and sanitary wherever I’ve gone. You are always at a distance from the other customers and the beautician/nail tech always shows that the products that will be used on you are sterile. I’ll probably be the first in line getting my hair cut since it’s way longer than I’ve wanted it to be.
 I have been to some local San Diego restaurants that have always been spot on and clean and keep patrons at a distance from each other. I would go back the moment they open up. I don’t see why this practice of sanitizing an area is not already in place in most public places. Plenty of times in casinos and restaurants I see someone vacuuming where I was walking but not cleaning where a bare hand has touched.
 The other factor in this is, are the people going out who are sick and with underlying conditions that could get you sick or themselves worse off? There should be accountability on their part to either stay home or not be in a crowded place where they could infect others or hurt themselves.

But just because scientific papers are easier to get hold of doesn’t mean that they are easy to make sense of. Reading them can be a challenge for the layperson, even one with some science education. It’s not just the jargon that scientists use to compress a lot of results into a small space. Just like sonnets, sagas and short stories, scientific papers are a genre with its own unwritten rules, rules that have developed over generations.
 The first scientific papers read more like letters among friends, recounting hobbies and oddities. The first issue of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, published on May 30, 1667, included brief dispatches with titles such as “An account of the improvement of optick glasses,” and “An account of a very odd monstrous calf.”
 When natural philosophers sent their letters to 17th-century journals, the editors decided whether they were worth publishing or not. But after 200 years of scientific advances, Victorian scientists could no longer be experts on everything. Journal editors sent papers to outside specialists who understood the details of a particular branch of research better than most scientists.
 By the mid-1900s, this practice evolved into a practice known as peer review. A journal would publish a paper only after a panel of outside experts decided it was acceptable. Sometimes the reviewers rejected the paper outright; other times they required the fixing of weak points — either by revising the paper or doing additional research.
 Along the way, scientific papers also developed a distinctive narrative arc. A paper published in Philosophical Transactions today is no longer a gossipy letter, but a four-part story. Papers typically open with some history, giving a justification for the new research they contain. The authors then lay out the methods they used to carry out that research — how they eavesdropped on lions, how they measured chemicals in Martian dust. Then the papers present results, followed by a discussion of what those results mean. Scientists will typically point out the shortcomings in their own research and offer ideas for new studies to see if their interpretations hold water.
 As a science writer, I’ve been reading scientific papers for 30 years. I’d guess that I’ve read tens of thousands of them, in search of new advances to write about, or to do background research for stories. While I’m not a scientist myself, I’ve gotten pretty comfortable navigating around them.
 One lesson I’ve learned is that it can take work to piece together the story underlying a paper. If I call scientists and simply ask them to tell me about what they’ve done, they can offer me a riveting narrative of intellectual exploration. But on the page, we readers have to assemble the story for ourselves.
 Part of the problem may be that many scientists don’t get much training in writing. As a result, it can be hard to figure out precisely what question a paper is tackling, how the results answer it and why any of it really matters.
 The demands of peer review — satisfying the demands of several different experts — can also make papers even more of a chore to read. Journals can make matters worse by requiring scientists to chop up their papers in chunks, some of which are exiled into a supplementary file. Reading a paper can be like reading a novel and realizing only at the end that Chapters 14, 30, and 41 were published separately.
 The coronavirus pandemic now presents an extra challenge: There are far more papers than anyone could ever read. If you use a tool like Google Scholar, you may be able to zero in on some of the papers that are already getting cited by other scientists. They can provide the outlines of the past few months of scientific history — the isolation of the coronavirus, for example, the sequencing of its genome, the discovery that it spreads quickly from person to person even before symptoms emerge. Papers like these will be cited by generations of scientists yet to be born.
 Most won’t, though. When you read through a scientific paper, it’s important to maintain a healthy skepticism. The ongoing flood of papers that have yet to be peer-reviewed — known as preprints — includes a lot of weak research and misleading claims. Some are withdrawn by the authors. Many will never make it into a journal. But some of them are earning sensational headlines before burning out in obscurity.
 In April, for example, a team of Stanford researchers published a preprint in which they asserted that the fatality rate of COVID-19 was far lower than other experts estimated. When Andrew Gelman, a Columbia University statistician, read their preprint, he was so angry he publicly demanded an apology.

While many linebackers slim down for the NFL Scouting Combine, allowing them to run faster, Murray held his playing weight — 241 pounds — and ran the 40-yard dash in 4.5 seconds to place among the the top 10 percent of linebackers in the draft class.
 “My weight hasn’t changed,” said the linebacker, whose above-average height (6-foot-2 1/2) and arm length are desired traits because of the NFL’s increased emphasis on pass defense. “What you see is what you get. I was 240 pretty much all the time in college.”
 The price to get Murray was one General Manager Tom Telesco hadn’t paid in his other seven drafts: two premium picks, traded to the Patriots, allowing Telesco to climb from 37 to 23.
 Mindful of Team Spanos’ 5-11 record and last-place finish last year, I suggested using two premium chips on two players was the better way to go, but another team’s investment four spots late stood out. That’s when the Seahawks, in a move that surprised many draftniks, selected Jordyn Brooks, also a swift, durable linebacker with Air Raid know-how and a Big 12 pedigree. Seahawks leaders John Schneider and Pete Carroll have built two Super Bowl teams, and have had a lot of success finding defenders who became NFL stars.

“We’ve definitely had discussions with UCSD coming into Div. I and USD (already) being Div.

TUCSON, Ariz. — TUCSON, Ariz. -- Countless protests continue across the nation, following the police killing of George Floyd.
 Velveia Evans, the owner of ATL Wings in Tucson, is now sending a message to both protesters and looters.
 For Evans, this protest is about seeking justice; justice, she says, that has been a long time coming.
 “My father went through this. My brothers went through this. Now my children are going through this,” said Evans.
 She tells KGUN9 she has lived in fear, all her life, because of the color of her skin.
 “Everyday I wake up, my skin is black, and many of you have no idea what it’s like to wonder when your child goes to the store, if you’ll ever see them again,” she added.
 She says this was the case with George Floyd.
 “America’s innocence was taken when we say a man lost his life right in front of our face,” said Evans.
 She says it was only a matter of time before people took to the streets to seek justice, including here in Tucson.
 “Anytime you own a business and there is uproar, violence in the area, you worry about your business. Fortunately and by the grace of God, we have not been vandalized,” she said.
 She and her husband Ralph Bankhead attribute this to their customers.
 “There’s no specific race creed or color. If we had to depend on one race or creed, we would be out of business. But this is truly an example of what we can be,” she told KGUN9.
 So they have decided not to board up and are still open for take-out. Though they realize the protests will go on -- and so will looters and vandals.
 Here is Evans' message to looters.
 “You might have your day today, but tomorrow belongs to the righteous,” she said.
 As for protesters, she encourages them to go out peacefully and be heard.
 “Stand up. Be proud. Make us proud. We want you to march. We want you to protest. Because what you protest has been protested ever since I can remember. Eventually someone will hear us. So don’t stop. MAybe this is the time that America will stand up and say, we are united,” she said.
 At the end of the day, Evans just hopes looters don’t overshadow the light protesters are trying to shed on police brutality towards African Americans.

“I don’t think we should just be sitting on our hands and saying, ‘It’s all doom and gloom, we can’t do anything,’” he said in an interview last week. “We have got to make the theaters as safe for everybody as we possibly can,” he said. And South Korea, he said, shows that it can work.
 That the show, at the Blue Square cultural complex in central Seoul, has gone on is a testament not just to the protocols in the theater, but to South Korea’s rigorous system of test, trace and quarantine, which has kept the virus largely under control.
 It was also a matter of sheer timing and luck, though it did not seem that way at first.
 When the tour’s previous stop in Busan, South Korea’s second biggest city, wrapped up in mid-February, the country was emerging as the latest epicenter of the pandemic.
 The company mostly went home for a break to Britain, Italy, North America, Australia and elsewhere. Serin Kasif, vice president of Lloyd Webber’s company, the Really Useful Group, and the producer of the tour, said she was fielding daily messages from company members anxious about whether to return.
 On March 2, when Kasif flew to Seoul to begin preparations to open there, South Korea had the second-highest number of confirmed cases, and the pandemic had not yet fully hit Britain.
 She contrasted the “overwhelming sense of fear” that developed in London with what she had experienced in Seoul, with its clear governmental directives and local partners who had lived through previous epidemics like SARS.
 “When I was speaking to our Korean partners, in lead-up to the decision to continue, one said, ‘The word “unprecedented” keeps getting used, but it’s not unprecedented here,’” she explained.
 “Amazingly,” Kasif said, the entire company returned to Seoul. Matt Leisy, a Northwestern University graduate who plays Raoul, said that when he went home to New York during the break, friends were “freaking out” at the idea that he might go back to Korea. But he said he was reassured by the producers’ constant communication about safety protocols, as well as their videos of daily life in Seoul.
 “It was quite scary leading up to us coming back,” he said. “Who knew we’d end up being in the safest place in the world?”
 The protocols, which are mandated by the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are strict, but they are not particularly space-age. Before entering the theater, audience members are sprayed with a light mist of disinfectant. Thermal sensors take each person’s temperature, and everyone fills out a questionnaire about symptoms and recent places they have visited, so they can be notified of any exposures they may have had through the country’s contract-tracing app.
 There are hand-sanitizing stations throughout, and ubiquitous signs and announcements reminding everyone that masks must be worn at all times. And in contrast to movie theaters, where alternating rows or seats are left empty, no seats are blocked off (though the first row was removed).

If you suspect a child may be at risk of physical or sexual abuse or severe neglect, but do not live in her or his home, consider the following ways to safely check in on the child’s well-being. Ask to participate in a video chat to say hello, and during the chat, ask open-ended questions about what she or he have been doing while at home. Maybe ask the child to share with you what has been the most enjoyable experience and what has been the most uncomfortable or scary experience. Ultimately, you want to give the child a chance to be heard. If video chat is not an option, request to schedule a physically distant face-to-face meeting and then bring something fun like a book or a game that helps to occupy the child’s time while out of school. This will provide you an opportunity to see the child face to face, providing a more realistic assessment of her or his overall health and well-being. If you are comfortable, drop by unexpectedly to say hello and let the child know you are thinking of her or him. When in doubt, you can always call your local law enforcement agency to conduct a “welfare check” if you have a legitimate and reasonable suspicion a child needs to be checked on.

 As if Edwards’ recruiting process wasn’t uncertain enough, it became even murkier when spring sports were canceled.
 Several of the schools Edwards was in contact with at the start of his senior year simply stopped talking to him after his ACL injury. Track season was supposed to be his window to prove the injury wasn’t an issue and he’s still a college-caliber athlete. But he never had the chance to make that statement in competition.
 “I was talking to some schools before for football and track and some of the schools quit talking to me. I kind of expected that,” Edwards said.
 The one school that stuck with Edwards from the start was Chadron State. He informed the school about his torn ACL as soon he knew for sure and told them he’d understand if they weren’t interested anymore.
 But Chadron coaches doubled down on Edwards and told him they’d love for him to take an on-campus visit. He was able to visit well before on-campus recruiting was shut down in late March and decided on the spot that he was going to be an Eagle.
 With all the adversity and uncertainty, Chadron’s continued support made the difference to Edwards while making his final decision.
 “Just to know that somebody was out there that was still interested and that it wasn’t over — that was the biggest thing,” Edwards said. “It was just relieving to have that off your back, the stress of where you’ll be at.”
 A medical appointment that was supposed to clear him for outdoor track never happened. It had to be canceled because of the coronavirrus quarantine, but Edwards said the knee is feeling good.
 He’s been running a lot and has also been on the track for some work with the hurdles. There’s still a little pain and it took Edwards time to get past the mental block of planting his weight on his left leg.
 It was the most trying year of Edwards’ young athletic career, but one he’ll remember forever and learn from.
 “It was just a huge life lesson. You can’t take anything for granted, because just like that it can be taken from you,” Edwards said. “We were just trying to run the clock out and I just planted my foot wrong and there it went.
 “You just have to know that at any given moment, stuff can go downhill fast.”
 Not many stories about ACL injuries have happy endings, but this one does. Edwards went from experiencing every senior athlete’s nightmare to achieving a dream of becoming a college athlete.

COVID-19 has disproportionately impacted black Americans, infecting and killing them at higher rates across the nation. But experts say the pandemic has also exacerbated existing economic disparities and raised fresh concerns about the survival of black businesses, many of which have been the backbone of cities like Detroit and Atlanta for years.
 They also worry the pandemic could widen the existing black wealth gap. According to the Federal Reserve's 2016 Survey of Consumer Finance, the median white family net worth of $171,000 is about 10 times greater than that of a black family's, which is $17,150.
 Black businesses historically have struggled to gain access to financing due to discriminatory lending practices and a lack of relationships with big banks. But civil rights leaders and historians say their struggles are also rooted in the simmering effects of racism and Jim Crow-era laws that enforced racial segregation and denied black people equal opportunities.
 “Structural racism has created an environment where black businesses are starved for capital,” said Marc Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League, a civil rights and urban advocacy organization.
 Juliet Walker, founder of University of Texas at Austin’s Center of Black Business, History, Entrepreneurship and Technology, said black enterprises existed even prior to the Civil War. They especially thrived during a “golden age” from 1900 to 1930 in areas such as Tulsa, Oklahoma’s Greenwood District, known as Black Wall Street. But those moments were short-lived.
 Tulsa’s once-thriving African American business community was destroyed in 1921 when a racist white mob killed hundreds of black residents. Black residents attempted to rebuild in the decades that followed, only to see their work erased during urban renewal of the 1960′s.
 “Blacks were able to establish successful business enterprises during the age of slavery where black people had no political or economic rights,” Walker said. “Yet, here we are today and the position of blacks in business differs very little from the position of blacks during the age of slavery.”
 Detroit was once home to Black Bottom and Paradise Valley — two predominantly African American neighborhoods, the latter of which had more than 350 black- owned businesses and a music scene that drew the likes of Louis Armstrong and Billie Holiday.
 Both were wiped out in the 1950's and 1960’s, when a nearly all-white city government allowed the construction of a freeway system through the heart of the neighborhoods.
 Jamon Jordan, a black historian based in Detroit, said the pandemic could have a similar crushing impact on black American businesses.
 “Each time this happens, the amount of energy and time it takes to recreate something that’s even as simple as what was destroyed is monumental,” Jordan said. “Even though the coronavirus isn't the fault of a single person or leader, the impact of the devastation on the African American community is part of a long legacy of discrimination and segregation for black people and black businesses.”
 Some black business owners have also expressed frustration with the Small Business Administration’s $659 billion Personal Paycheck Protection Program, which was meant to provide small businesses with loans to keep employees on their payrolls during the COVID-19 crisis. The initial round of funding ran out in just 13 days, with complaints over lag times and confusion over the application process. However, the SBA made improvements in its second round and more than $100 billion remains available.

NEW YORK (AP) — Though Black Out Tuesday was originally organized by the music community, the social media world also went dark in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, joining voices around the world outraged by the killings of black people in the U.S.
 Instagram and Twitter accounts, from top record label to everyday people, were full of black squares posted in response to the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor.
 Most of the captions were blank, though some posted #TheShowMustBePaused, black heart emojis or encouraged people to vote Tuesday with seven states and the District of Columbia are hosting the largest slate of presidential primary elections in almost three months.
 Rihanna, Alicia Keys, Radiohead, Coldplay, Kelly Rowland, Beastie Boys and were among the celebrities to join Black Out Tuesday on social media.
 "I won't be posting on social media and I ask you all to do the same," Britney Spears tweeted. "We should use the time away from our devices to focus on what we can do to make the world a better place …. for ALL of us !!!!!"
 Spotify blacked out the artwork for several of its popular playlists, including RapCaviar and Today's Top Hits, simply writing "Black lives matter." as its description. The streaming service also put its Black Lives Matter playlist on its front page, featuring songs like James Brown's "Say It Loud — I'm Black and I'm Proud," N.W.A.'s "(Expletive) the Police," Sam Cooke's "A Change Is Gonna Come" and Childish Gambino's "This Is America."
 The opening pages of Apple Music and iTunes focused on supporting Black Lives Matter, and SiriusXM said it will be silencing its music channels for three minutes at 3 p.m. EDT in tribute to "all of the countless victims of racism."
 The company said it "will continue to amplify Black voices by being a space where Black artists showcase their music and talents, and by carrying the message that racism will not be tolerated."
 Some on social media questioned if posting black squares would divert attention away from posts about the Black Lives Matter movement.
 "this is the 4th completely different flyer i've seen for it," Grammy- nominated singer Kehlani tweeted about Black Out Tuesday. ""this is the only one without the saying go completely silent for a day in solidarity. the messages are mixed across the board and i really hope it doesn't have a negative effect."
 When musician Dillon Francis posted that the hashtag for Black Lives Matter was blank on Instagram because users were posting black squares, rapper Lil Nas X responded with: "this is not helping us. bro who the (expletive) thought of this?? ppl need to see what's going on."
 Several music releases and events were postponed as a result of Black Out Tuesday. Interscope Geffen A&M Records said it would not release music this week and pushed back releases from MGK, 6lack, Jessie Ware, Smokepurp and others. Chloe x Halle said its sophomore album will come out June 12 instead of Friday, while the group Glass Animals postponed the Tuesday release of its new single "Heat Waves." Instead of being released Wednesday, singer Ashnikko will drop her song "Cry" and its video on June 17.
 A benefit for the Apollo Theater will take place Thursday instead of Tuesday, and South by Southwest postponed an event planned with Rachael Ray.
 "At SXSW we stand with the black community and will continue to amplify the voices and ideas that will lead us to a more equitable society," the company said.

Laura Crocco Shaw October 9, 1921 - May 29,2020 Laura Crocco Shaw was born in Stockton, California on October 9, 1921. She was the youngest daughter of Angelo Crocco and Rose Bernini Crocco. Raised on the family farm in Knightsen, she attended Knightsen Elementary school and Liberty Union High School where she participated in academic clubs and high school sports. Graduating in 1939, Laura attended Stockton Business College where she graduated with a degree in Secretarial Administration. Laura moved to Martinez, California where she soon fell in with a group of amazing young women. She met her best friend, Harriet Jackson Pistochini, and the two of them remained exactly that until Harriet's death in 2018. They raised their children together and we remain family to this day. Laura began her banking career as an Executive Secretary at the Bank of America in Martinez in 1941. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the men were sent to war and the women stepped up. She moved into the Administrative area of banking where she remained until she retired at the age of 70 as an Executive Vice President for Lafayette Federal Savings. During this time, Laura met and married John Shaw, a returning Army Veteran of WW2. They raise two children, Leslie and John, in Pleasant Hill, California. Retirement did not suit her. She went to work part- time first for Bank of the West and then for CitiBank, spending the next 8 years fending off their offers to move her into management. She finally retired from banking in at the age of 78. In 1998 Laura sold the family home in Pleasant Hill and moved to Modesto, where her late father's family had put down roots 100 years earlier. Laura moved to Modesto specifically to help her son John with child care for he had blessed her with two handsome grandsons, Ryan and Stephen, and a beautiful granddaughter, Jillian Rose. Her daughter Leslie came with her and together they created a home in Modesto that was centered around God, Family and Football. She embraced her new life and enjoyed every single minute with her tribe. Sundays were spent first praying the Holy Mass at St. Joseph's Parish and then watching her beloved San Francisco Forty-Niners play the game she had loved since she listened to it on the radio at 'The Ranch'. Faithful since 1946, she coached from the couch regularly firing staff and benching players. Her favorite players of all time were Joe Montana and Dwight Clark, though she thinks that George Kittle and Kwon Alexander aren't half bad. Laura is survived by her daughter, Leslie Shaw Klinger, OP of Modesto and her son John S. Shaw (Crissie) of Oakdale. She is also survived by her grandchildren Ryan, Stephen and Jillian Rose, her nephews George Arata Sr. (Marla) of Modesto and Dewey Mansfield (Lorna) of Eugene, Oregon, her 'other sons' Greg Peter Pistochini (Brian) of Healdsburg, Ca and Mark Pistochini (Deirdre) of Virginia. Laura is also survived by the mother of her grandchildren whom she dearly loved, Pamela Miller Shaw. Laura has numerous nephews and nieces in Oregon, Colorado, Wyoming, Maryland, Boston and Texas. She particularly looked forward to her visits with her Niece Natalie Rose (Gordon) in the summer and had hoped to cheer Natalie on as she attempts to swim the English Channel next year. Mama loved all her family members. She will now be of great support to them from her powerful position before the throne of the Most High, Jesus Christ. She was preceded in death by her husband John, her parents, her siblings Irene, Della, Jeanne and Jerry and son-in-law Fred and daughter-in-law Lisa. Laura never got the chance to personally thank Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith for the peace of mind those two men gave her as a result of their collaboration. However, there is no doubt that when she arrived in heaven she sought them out in order to do so. In lieu of flowers, Laura would like people to consider supporting the Religious Education Department at St Joseph's Catholic Church in Modesto, California or the Stockton Animal Shelter where she met her buddy, Shaw's Rob Roy MacDuff. Services will be private as a result of the current pandemic. Please keep her in prayer, as she will you. www.cvobituaries.com

We can support migrants who are among the hardest hit, and we can also learn best practices from Asian nations that have curbed community spread and democratized testing.
 Before this “Great Pause,” the trend lines of America’s waning supremacy and Asia’s ascendancy fascinated scholars and pundits. In the wake of COVID-19’s staggering toll, we can set aside that debate because superpowers failed to rise to the occasion.
 The enormity of global challenges ahead — climate change, deepening inequality and infectious diseases — require nations to cooperate and build resiliency. The imperative to heal will call for a rethinking of national security and its related spending and strategies — swords will have to be beaten into ventilators.
 A post-pandemic world worth fighting for will demand an economic orientation that prioritizes collective wellness and inclusion. It must require each of us to become caretakers for each other and our planet. The sheer magnitude of rebuilding this world may be bigger than America and Asia, but Asia-America synergy is more essential than ever.

On Monday, 715 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division arrived in the capital area in case the situation in Washington escalated. They are now stationed at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland and Fort Belvoir in Virginia. Two more 82nd Airborne battalions, totaling 1,300 soldiers, are on standby at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, according to the documents reviewed by the AP. The plan is named Operation Themis.
 The soldiers on standby in the Washington area are armed and have riot gear and bayonets. After the AP first reported the issuing of bayonets Tuesday, orders came down that soldiers would not need the knife-like weapons that can be affixed to rifles, according to two soldiers from the 82nd who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear they would be punished for commenting publicly. The idea that bayonets could be used in confronting civilians provoked an outcry on social media and among some members of Congress.
 Already administration officials were privately acknowledging that the Monday’s events didn’t serve the administration well. Some Republican lawmakers, who are typically in lockstep with the president or at least refrain from publicly criticizing him, said he had gone too far in appearing to use force to clear the way for his visit to the church.
 “There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others’ property, and no right to throw rocks at police,” said Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse. “But there is a fundamental — a constitutional — right to protest, and I’m against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop.”
 Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said of Trump posing for photos holding up a Bible, “I just wish he opened it once in a while.”
 Trump’s Cabinet also played a role in what appeared to be an orchestrated event.
 It was Attorney General William Barr who gave the order for law enforcement to clear out the protest before Trump’s walk to the church and ahead of Washington’s 7 p.m. curfew. A person familiar with the matter said the decision was made earlier Monday, but had not been executed by the time Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to survey the scene Monday evening. He verbally gave the order at that time.

Bill McGillis, his USD counterpart, sounded more emphatic, noting the Toreros’ schedule is essentially completed and could be released shortly.
 “I wish it had worked out this year but it did not,” McGillis said. “We’d love to play San Diego State every year. This year, it did not work out for them as they were putting their schedule together. We ended up in a good place with our own schedule. We look forward to resuming the series at the right time.”
 It could be a while. While USD has more maneuverability in November and December with the West Coast Conference playing a 16-game league schedule, the Mountain West is heading in the opposite direction — expanding from 18 to 20 games starting in 2022-23 pending approval by its presidents next month. That would leave between nine and 11 nonconference games, including an annual trip to a three-game holiday tournament, and likely wipe out the first week of December — when SDSU and USD games are historically played — for league games.
 There’s also the elevation of UC San Diego to Division I this year.

 The resolution was added to the agenda at the start of the meeting.
 Though no discussion was held before the vote, Councilman Fred Shanks pointed out during end-of-the-meeting communications from councilmen and other city officials that a lot of effort went into attracting Caesars to Danville.
 "It's very important to understand how much work was done behind the scenes," Shanks said.
 Caesars was the lead contender from among four finalists — seven had initially responded to the city's request for proposals issued in December — hoping to bring a casino resort to Danville. City officials and a representative from the company announced during an event at the Schoolfield site May 18 that Danville leaders were in negotiations with Caesars for a possible project there.
 A casino development at Schoolfield — the property that currently includes the former Dan River Inc. finishing building — would bring more traffic to that part of the city and attract additional businesses, officials have said.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh admitted on Tuesday that a “sizeable number” of Chinese troops have moved into eastern Ladakh, PTI reported. He said India was taking all steps necessary to deal with the situation. This is the first admission by the Centre that Chinese troops have encroached upon Indian territory.
 Singh said a meeting between senior Indian and Chinese military leaders has been scheduled for June 6. He added that there is “disagreement” between India and China about the territory in Ladakh, and the Chinese have occupied what they feel is theirs.
 “There has been a disagreement over it,” he said. “A sizeable number of Chinese people have come there. India has done what it needs to do.”
 The Opposition had last month lashed out at the Narendra Modi-led government, demanding that it come clean on the standoff with China on the Ladakh and North Sikkim borders. “The government’s silence about the border situation with China is fueling massive speculation and uncertainty at a time of crisis,” Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said on May 29. “GOI [Government of India] must come clean and tell India exactly what’s happening.”
 The Congress leader’s remarks came two days after the party had called the stand-off between the two nations a matter of “serious national concern”. On May 26, Gandhi had made a similar demand and said the government should make it clear as to what was happening on the border so that people can understand and form their own opinions.
 Over the last three weeks, Chinese troops have clashed with the Indian Army at several points along the Line of Actual Control. India and China do not share a defined and demarcated border. Instead, there is the Line of Actual Control, which stretches thousands of kilometres from Ladakh all the way to Arunachal Pradesh.
 Singh said on Tuesday that the 74-day standoff in Doklam between the two countries was resolved through talks. “We have found solutions to similar situations in the past as well,” he said. “Talks at the military and diplomatic levels were on to resolve the current issue. India does not hurt pride of any country and at the same time, it does not tolerate any attempt to hurt its own pride.”

As for rivers or creeks, those with the fire department say that the water current might be stronger than it looks, so it's best to play it safe when near a moving body of water.
 "Even walking the riverbank, you've got rocks on the side that are slippery and people fall in when they don’t mean to, and even when they’re wading through the river, there are rocks that are slippery and they end up slipping, and falling in the current can take them down," Dillon said.

 All-terrain vehicles and bicycles are popular ways of getting around and having some fun as the weather gets warmer. But just like any other mode of transportation, there are things that people need to keep in mind as they use them.

 "The number one thing that people should do is wear a helmet; they need to protect our most valuable asset, which is our brains, and so I would encourage everyone, young and old, to make sure that they’re wearing a helmet when they're out and riding," said Josh Unterbrink, co-director of Activate Allen County.

The doctors told him it was a torn anterior cruciate ligament, but Edwards said he refused to believe it at first. He told the doctors and his parents that a knee brace would suffice and he was already trying to make plans to return to the football field the following week.
 Eventually, the TBHS senior was forced to accept the crushing news. The Bolts would be without their starting running back for the rest of the season. But that was only part of the heartbreak for Edwards.
 He had burst onto the scene as one of Wyoming Class 4A’s top hurdlers as a junior, which sparked a dream of winning state titles and running track and field in college. He was the state runner-up in the hurdles during the previous indoor season and was third last spring after giving up the lead late in the race.
 But a torn ACL typically comes with a six- to nine-month recovery period. This past indoor track season was considered impossible by Edwards’ physical therapists and outdoor was only a distant possibility.
 “I wanted to run track in college and I didn’t know if I was going to be able to get any schools to look at me now that I was hurt,” Edwards said. “It was just kind of nerve-wracking and at the same time really sad knowing it was all over with.”
 Throwing in the towel was never an option for Edwards. Even without a spring track and field season because of the COVID-19 pandemic, he has committed to run track for Chadron State College in Chadron, Nebraska, just over eight months from that night on the field against Sheridan.
 Long journey back
 The weeks following the injury were uncertain and frustrating, Edwards said. The first four games of the football season were the best of his career up to that point, then he found himself propped up by crutches, watching the team’s final eight games from the sideline.
 As a senior captain, he knew it was his responsibility to be there cheering on his teammates, but it still “was tough to watch,” he said.
 After surgery, some of the mental struggles started to set in. Before he started the long physical therapy process, he looked himself in the mirror and decided to dedicate himself to work like he always had.
 “One day it just kind of clicked. I thought, ‘You can either sit here and mope or you can do something about it,’” Edwards said. “I just went in there every day and worked my tail off.
 “It was just kind of an attitude that I wasn’t going to give up.”
 Remembering what he was working toward made all the difference. Edwards said his mindset changed to “there’s a point now” and he told his therapists he had to be ready to run when outdoor track arrived.
 His routine was six days of PT every week. Edwards told himself if he wasn’t giving 100%, it was going to hurt him in the long run.

“He fails to recognize the institutional racism that many students of color have to face,” said Marlon Dubuisson, a 2017 graduate with a degree in business marketing. “He almost talked more about his disagreement with how they’re protesting than why they’re protesting.”
 According to university spokesman Jim Hanchett, Trible received the letter and would respond to it Wednesday.
 Dubuisson, who works as outreach director for Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Fairfax), put up a letter Monday on his Facebook page and Twitter co-signed by six other alumni calling the message “tone deaf."
 In the following day, thousands of people responded asking that their name be added. When the letter was sent Tuesday afternoon to Trible and the Board of Visitors, it had 1,767 signatures.
 “It’s not just black students who are saying this,” Dubuisson said. “It’s not just alumni saying this. It is staff, it is white students, it is current students, and even incoming students are reaching out to me.”
 The former Republican congressman and senator has been president of the university since 1996. His son, Paul Trible III, co-founded Ledbury in 2009 with Paul Watson, a fellow graduate of Oxford Business School in the U.K. According to the company’s website, the two had planned to pursue careers in finance before the 2008 recession, after which they started making shirts.
 Ledbury posted a photo to Instagram on Sunday of its showroom on West Broad Street in Richmond. Much of the glass on the storefront had been knocked out.
