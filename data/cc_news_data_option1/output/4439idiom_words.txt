  The body of a Seneca man was found in Six Mile Sunday morning.


  The Pickens County Sheriff's Office received a report from a passing motorist about a suspicious person that appeared to be injured on the shoulder of Ponderosa Drive near Ponderosa Park around 8:35 a.m. Sunday, according to a press release from the Sheriff's Office.


  When deputies arrived on the scene, they found a man dead just feet from the road, according to the release.


  Pickens County Coroner Kandy Kelley later identified the man as Dustin Lee Smith, 31, of Laing Court in Seneca.


  Deputies determined the death appeared suspicious, and an investigation by the Sheriff's Office is continuing.


  Anyone who was in that area Saturday night into Sunday morning and noticed anything unusual or suspicious is asked to call the Crime Stoppers at 1-888-CRIME-SC.


  Kelley said Smith's manner of death was a homicide.


  An autopsy will be performed at Greenville Memorial Hospital.

It was Saturday, May 30, just five days after Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin squeezed the final breath out of George Floyd, digging his knee into the back of Floyd's neck for more than 9 minutes as he cried out in anguish for help. In the midst of a global pandemic that already had claimed a disproportionate number of Black lives, people across the country flooded the streets to protest the national epidemic of police violence against Black communities. It wasn't just Minneapolis and large coastal cities like Los Angeles and New York that rose up in anger, but also smaller, Whiter towns, some of them deep inside Trump country. Like the struggling Rust Belt town of Erie, Pennsylvania, a former industrial hub that's lost nearly two-thirds of its manufacturing jobs and a quarter of its population over the last half- century. In 2016, Donald Trump won Erie County by 2 points.
