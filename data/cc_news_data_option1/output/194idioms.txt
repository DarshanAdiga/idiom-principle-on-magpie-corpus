Nights don't get much more meaningful than the one Truman High School senior Kaimen Lennox experienced Tuesday night.
 He was presented with a ceremonial game ball - to commemorate his recent 1,000th career point - and he followed that by scoring the final four points in a dramatic 62-60 Suburban Large Seven Conference win over Liberty.
 "This was a total team win," an appreciative Truman coach Rod Briggs said, "but in the end, we wanted the ball in Kaimen's hands and he came through for us."
 Lennox's teammate, Jeilel White, who created the commemorative ball that was signed by all his Truman teammates, took it a step further, adding, "Kaimen is stone cold. With the game on the line - like it was tonight - I don't want anyone touching the ball but Kaimen.
 "He's the best guard I've ever played with. Nothing bothers him. Did you see him hit those last two free throws? We knew they were in before he even shot them."
 Ironically, Lennox got out of his pregame routine when Briggs presented him the basketball commemorating his 1,000th career point, which he scored Jan. 8 in a 59-46 win over St. Joseph Central.
 "I have this pregame routine I go through and I got out of it a little bit when they presented me the ball," said Lennox, who scored nine of his game- high 21 points in the nail-biting fourth quarter comeback. "It took me a while to get into a rhythm in the game."
 But once he did, he showed the standing room only student section why he is a member of the 1,000-point club.
 With Truman leading 58-56 with 23 seconds left, Lennox took a deft pass from Cam Robins and drove to the basket to hit a layup, making it 60-56.
 He was then fouled and hit both free throws to give the Patriots (9-3, 3-1 Large Seven) an insurmountable lead as the Blue Jays made it close at the end on two free throws and a Javion Byers 3-pointer at the buzzer.
 "I know how far our program has come and that makes a win like this even more meaningful," Briggs said. "We needed to do a better job of getting the ball into Kaimen's hands at the end, but Cam and Jeilel each came up with big free throws that helped us win this game."
 Following the win, Lennox posed for photos with friends, teammates and family members and reflected on his big night.
 "I got to share a win with my teammates and the presentation with my mom and dad and family," Lennox said. "This is one of those nights you never forget."
 Macio Moananu added 14 points for the Patriots, Phillips finished with nine and Sam Billimon had eight.
 Grant Stubbs led the Blue Jays with 14 points.

The 6-foot-6, 310-pound lineman’s departure leaves a gaping hole on the left side of the Trojans’ offensive line. With graduate transfer right tackle Drew Richmond out of eligibility, USC will now have to replace both of its starting offensive tackles next season. If Alijah Vera-Tucker makes a surprise decision to follow Jackson into the draft, the offense could be in dire straits up front.
 Jalen McKenzie, who started last season at right guard, and Liam Jimmons, who impressed in his transition from the defensive to offensive line last season, could be options to replace Jackson at left tackle. USC signed six offensive linemen during the early-signing period in hopes of mitigating its losses at left and right tackle.
 For Jackson, the decision to declare appeared to be a clear one. Draft prognosticators have suggested he is a probable first- or second-round pick. Many agree that Jackson is still a raw prospect, but one with the prototype size and athleticism that NFL scouts covet.

But the question of where the cash had come from left authorities baffled. The police revealed this week that two people who wished to be known only as good Samaritans had been dotting the money around town in an effort to “give something back” to the community.
 At least 26,000 pounds had been found since 2014 near the main street of Blackhall Colliery, a former mining village of less than 5,000 residents on the North Sea coast.
 The Durham Constabulary, the police force responsible for the surrounding county, first went public with the mystery in November in a last-ditch effort to find the source of the money. Inquiries to residents, village organizations, the post office and local bank had yielded nothing, nor had tests for fingerprints.
 “These bundles are always left in plain sight such as on pavements and discovered by random members of the public who have handed them in,” John Forster, detective constable of the Durham Constabulary said in a statement released in November, after the fourth bundle that year was handed to the police. He appealed to the public to come forward with any relevant information.
 The news of the cash drops spread quickly, drawing international attention and heated speculation about who, or what, might be behind them. The village residents were also praised for their honesty, as they consistently turned the cash over to the police. When no one came to claim it, the finders received the money themselves.
 At least one element of the mystery came to an end on Monday, when the Durham Constabulary said that two people had come forward as the village’s philanthropists.
 They both asked to remain anonymous, and police referred to them as only “the good Samaritans.” Forster said in a phone interview on Tuesday that the pair — who, he said, knew each other but appear to be unrelated — did not choose Blackhall Colliery “at random.”
 “It’s something personal for them,” he said.
 The police said in a statement released this week that “both generous individuals had recently received unexpected windfalls and told police they wanted to give something back.”
 “One of the Good Samaritans told detectives that they felt an ‘emotional connection’ to the village after being helped by one of the residents, so she wanted to repay the kindness she received,” police said.
 Police said that the pair left the bundles of 20-pound notes in places where people in need, including the elderly or vulnerable, would be likely to find them.
 But police said they didn’t leave everything to chance, and often waited until they saw someone pick up the money.
 Forster said on Tuesday that the only detail he had withheld from the public was the exact way the bundles were wrapped. That detail was “one of the bits of information that we used to verify the authenticity of these people,” he added.
 Forster said that if more cash were to appear on the sidewalks in Blackhall Colliery, residents should still hand it in to police. They would most likely get it back — all the previous cash bundles were returned to the people who found them, according to police — but now they could feel good about using the money.

When an additional $300 million in sports betting revenue is added to the equation, the casinos and two racetracks that offer sports betting won $3.46 billion last year, a figure that does not include money from horse racing bets.
 It marked the first year since 2012 that Atlantic City's casinos had won more than $3 billion from gamblers.
 That was right before a brutal stretch from 2014 to 2016 that saw five of the then-12 casinos shut down, and more than 11,000 jobs lost.
 The reopening in 2018 of the former Trump Taj Mahal as Hard Rock and the former Revel as the Ocean Casino Resort has brought added revenue and jobs to the market.
 But those same two new casinos also are diluting the profitability of the seven casinos that were in business before they reopened. For the first three quarters of 2019, the nine casinos reported a cumulative gross operating profit of $484 million, down 4.5% from the same period in 2018.
 “The revenue increase is a positive,” said David Schwartz, a gambling historian with the University of Nevada Las Vegas. “Right now the industry should be in ‘grow-the-market’ mode rather than seeking to consolidate profits, so a decrease in profits isn't necessarily the worst news we could get. Overall, what Atlantic City needs right now is to improve its image and marketing and become a destination in a crowded Northeast casino market.”
 Rummy Pandit, a gambling analyst with Stockton University, said Atlantic City has successfully diversified its gambling offerings, particularly through sports betting and internet gambling. Those two products, developed since November 2013, now account for more than 18% of Atlantic City's winnings, he said.
 The news was not all positive. Five of the nine casinos won less money in 2019 than they did in 2018. Tropicana was down 8.2% to $349.5 million; Harrah's was down 6.1% to $312.6 million; Bally's was down 5.4% to $181.5 million; Caesars was down 3.7% to $270.9 million; and Resorts was down 3.2% to $178.4 million.
 The Golden Nugget was up 15.4% to $378.4 million. It finished the year as the No. 2 casino in Atlantic City in terms of revenue. The perennial leader, Borgata, was up 3.5% to $797.8 million.
 There was no year-to-year comparison for the newest casinos, which had not been open for a full year in 2018. For 2019, Hard Rock won $350 million, and Ocean won $238 million.
 New Jersey had a banner year at sports betting, with nearly $4.6 billion wagered on pro and college games.
 The state won a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case in 2018, clearing the way for all 50 states to offer legal sports betting should they so choose. Since the first bets were taken in New Jersey in June 2018, more than $5.8 billion has been wagered on sports, putting the state right behind Nevada in the race to lead the burgeoning market.
 The Meadowlands Racetrack in East Rutherford, just outside New York City, was the runaway leader in sports betting revenue with just under $150 million. It is partnered with the FanDuel sportsbook. The other racetrack to offer sports betting, Monmouth Park in Oceanport, won nearly $26 million in sports bets. Resorts Digital, which is affiliated with the DraftKings online sports book, won nearly $80 million on sports.
 Internet gambling also continued to be a bright spot in 2019, with $482 million won online from gamblers, an increase of more than 61% over 2018. In the month of December, nearly $558 million was wagered on sports in New Jersey, the second-best month ever, trailing only November’s total of nearly $563 million.

Bought my dad a Christmas gift and surprised him. He's had a hard life. This one felt good. My dad, Rocky Johnson is a minimalist. Always has been. Never asks me for much and over the years his needs are always the barest. Crazy story, my dad's dad died when he was 13yrs old. That Christmas, my dad's mom had her new boyfriend over for Christmas dinner. Her boyfriend got drunk and pissed on the turkey. My dad went outside, got a shovel, drew a line in the snow and said if you cross that line I'll kill you. The drunk crossed it and my dad laid him out cold as a block of ice. Cops were called. They told my dad's mom that when her boyfriend regains consciousness, he's gonna kill your son so one of them has got to go. In front of the entire family, my dad's mom looked at him and said get out. He was 13yrs old and now homeless. That f*cked up true story happened in Amherst, Nova Scotia, Canada in 1954. He needed the bare minimum then, just like does now. Over the years, I've moved him into a big home, got him trucks to drive - which he'll literally drive into the ground until I get him something else. Hell, I'll get him anything he wants, but the SOB just won't ask;). Every Christmas, I always think about that story and my dad having every odd stacked against him at 13, but he fought thru it and still made something of himself. Makes me appreciate his struggle and hard work. Also, makes me appreciate the fun times he would beat my ass in the gym so bad when I was 13 and say "If you're gonna throw up, go outside.. and if you're gonna cry, then go home to your mother". I hated it then, but I embrace it now. Made a man outta me. Without pissing on my turkey. 😂👍🏾. Just a small way of saying thank you dad and Merry Christmas! #DwantaClaus🎅🏾

“This bill is not going to solve our challenges but it is a good first step...” said Rep. Al Gentry, D-Louisville. “Sports betting is already here, we just want to regulate it, we just want to retain the revenues that are leaving.”
 The push to pass a sports betting bill has become a legislative priority for lawmakers thirsty for new sources of revenue to help pay for the demands of a tight budget. Several Republicans, including bill sponsor Adam Koenig of Erlanger, have been joined by Democrats in backing the bill. Gov. Andy Beshear called on the legislature to pass a sports betting bill in his State of the Commonwealth Address Tuesday.
 The bill would raise an estimated $22.5 million in tax revenue for the state.
 Similar bills have met a dead-end in the legislature, including one in 2019. Koenig said the biggest complaint against the previous version of his bill was that it did not allow people to bet on Kentucky’s college sports teams.
 “If you’ve got five wagers you want to make over the weekend and one of them is on an instate college team and you’ve got to do four legally and one illegally, you might just make all five illegally,” Koenig said.
 In order to bet on sports, people would either have to bet in-person at the horse racing tracks or at Kentucky Speedway, or go to the race tracks to download an app that would allow them to bet at home. The state would tax profits at 10.25 percent for in-person betting and 14.25 percent for online betting. The Kentucky Racing Commission would oversee betting.
 The amended bill also would end the requirement to download an app at the racetracks by January 1, 2022, which Koenig said should help create competition in a sports betting industry that will be anchored by Kentucky’s already established gambling institutions.
 “People, if they’re so inclined, will be able able to download every app from every track across the state,” Koenig said. “So that should provide plenty of competition.”
 While the bill sailed through committee, it still has some opposition. In the front row at the hearing, people wore stickers on their jackets saying “Expanded gambling is no dice.”
 Martin Cothran, with the conservative Family Foundation of Kentucky, briefly expressed moral concerns over the bill before making the case that sports betting is expanded gambling and therefore requires a constitutional amendment.
 “There is no criteria by which we can say that expanded gambling requires a constitutional amendment and sports wagering does not,” Cothran said. “There is no net with holes big enough to let sports wagering in that are small enough to keep expanded gambling and other forms out and that is because it is a form of expanded gambling.”
 Cothran said that there are only three forms of wagering allowed under the constitution: pari-mutual horse betting, charitable gaming and the lottery. Cothran said that means the bill would have to be passed as a constitutional amendment, which would require more votes to approve in the legislature and would require Kentuckians to vote on it.
 He was met with opposition from Rep. Chad McCoy, R-Bardstown, who pointed out that Cothran wasn’t citing legal arguments that dealt with sports wagering.
 Koenig said during constitutional debates in 1890, delegates at the constitutional convention said “all species of gambling and all games of chance, such as untz, craps, bucket shops, grain gambling, betting on baseball, draw poker and lord knows how many other species” would not be barred by the constitution.

 If Disney is planning to continue to play it safe and build off an already- built empire, then it's doing a great job.

It might be thought that the comparatively secular 20th century would have put paid to the religiously charged jeremiad. Yet we find it present in the Early Modernists. Adorned with Feininger’s Gothic cathedral woodcut, and harking back to medieval guilds and church-builders, the _Bauhaus Manifesto_ (1919), penned by Walter Gropius, is far from a dry Functionalist text. Instead, it extols the importance of merging art and craft in a biblical language of salvation, ‘Let us strive for, conceive and create the new building of the future that will unite every discipline, architecture and sculpture and painting, and which will one day rise heavenwards from the million hands of craftsmen as a clear symbol of a new belief to come’.

Flexaust and National OnDemand are bringing 80 new jobs to Burlington this year and using existing buildings for their new sites.
   
 Flexaust is opening a manufacturing and distribution site at 1902 Tucker St., while National OnDemand is opening its headquarters at 245 W. Davis St. Flexaust makes flexible lightweight ducts and hoses. National OnDemand provides cabling and fiber services.
   
 The companies represent a capital investment of $5.3 million. Both received Building Reuse Grants from the N.C. Department of Commerce.
   
 "We were really excited about the growth opportunities," National OnDemand CEO Douglas Boteler said Tuesday, Jan. 14, at the annual Alamance County Economic Development Foundation meeting. "The grant really helped us in making that final decision, but we've been really excited with everything so far."
   
 Alamance Chamber President Mac Williams thanked investors, including Duke Energy, Elon University and LabCorp, over lunch at the Alamance Country Club as 2019's success stories were celebrated.
   
 "In 2019, we're proud to recognize these two companies for their investment in Alamance County," Williams said.
   
 Alamance Chamber awarded both companies 2019 Company Awards. Williams also gave Mebane's N.C. Industrial Center the 2019 Economic Impact award. NCIC was made possible by the Ray family, Samet Corp. and Mebane, with all parties receiving the award.
   
 Chandler Concrete also announced expansion to a new site last year in Mebane's N.C. Commerce Park.
   
 Looking back, ahead
   
 Apprenticeships are on the rise, and the chamber has invested in this growing trend as part of the Eastern Triad Workforce Initiative, which provides apprenticeships and on-the-job training.
   
 "The apprenticeship movement is really taking off in and around the state," Williams said.
   
 The Chamber has focused also on expanding economic development and nurturing small businesses by creating an appropriate ecosystem for them. This includes easier access to resources and information they need to succeed in Alamance County.
   
 The Chamber also has been trying to promote the area and attract more people by emphasizing what the county already has to offer.
   
 "Some places are paying people money to come here. We're not quite there yet," Williams said.
   
 State outlook
   
 North Carolina's economic outlook is positive in the next years, according to Troy Woodard, chair of the county Economic Development Foundation. The biggest challenge for the state is workforce development, Woodard said.
   
 "We have the land. We have the resources. And we definitely have the labor, and we have a great relationship with Alamance Community College to support workforce development." Woodard said. "I think we're pretty well posed for future growth."
   
 The keynote speaker at the lunch was David Spratley, senior assistant secretary of finance at the N.C. Department of Commerce. Spratley also reviewed 2019 and addressed challenges that he sees the state facing in the future. The biggest challenge he sees is the declining number of projects.
   
 "We continue to see a slowdown on decisions and the number of projects that are foreign projects, in light of trade tensions," Spratley said.
   
 Typically, the department works on 280 to 300 projects on any given day. That number is down to 200.
   
 "Things are slowing down," he said.
   
 Full employment, trade tensions and the election year are the main reasons, according to Spratley.
   
 "That fact alone causes companies to pause their planning and execution of investment until the outcomes of the election are known," he said.
   
 To compete in this climate, Spratley recommends being prepared.
   
 "This is the one key piece that a lot of communities do, and a lot of communities don't do well." he said.
   
 The main reason that communities in North Carolina lose projects is the lack of viable real estate options, he said. The key to staying competitive is being able to respond to project demands quickly, he said.
   
 "You don't have time to sell yourself," Spratley said. "You've got to be able to respond to something quickly, and then be able to deliver quickly."

We hadn't had the new microwave that long when, all of a sudden, it decided it just didn't want to microwave anymore.      "You had one job," I said to the microwave, chastising it after it failed to reheat some leftovers. "Is that really so hard?"      Naturally, I had no idea what went into making a microwave microwave. I assumed it probably had something to do with the sun, since it used microwaves, and maybe also radio waves or ultraviolet rays, and therefore there was surely a solar panel installed somewhere, that made it work, as well as a transistor radio and sunscreen. Since I had no experience with microwaves or radio waves or UV waves (except that one time when I was seven and I got a really bad sunburn), I thought this was all well out of my limited range of appliance repair knowledge and decided to call in a professional.      I looked online for a repairman in my area and chose Mike's Microwave repair because it had a number of good reviews and also, Mike and Microwave both begin with an M and I like alliteration. I had to wait two weeks for Mike to show up because apparently, there was a sudden epidemic of microwave deaths at the same time that mine pooped out. It was like some kind of microwave flu that must have been transmitted over the airwaves, or maybe the radio waves, I couldn't be certain.      By the time Mike finally arrived I was beside myself. I was a child of the microwave generation and never realized that food could also be reheated in an actual oven, so for two weeks I ate cold leftovers and brooded about how difficult life was without a microwave.      "I think it might be the fuse," said Mike when he finally arrived and did triage on my microwave. "It should be an easy fix, but there's a chance I might have to do open oven surgery. I need you to sign a release."      "A release?" I said. "For what?"      "Acknowledging that the appliance was not functioning when I arrived and nothing I did caused it to further malfunction."      "Fine," I said and signed the form. "But before you do anything, you should try pointing the satellite dish in a different direction to see if that solves the problem, because not only is the microwave broken, but also, our TV isn't getting very good reception."      He looked at me like I was one burner short of stovetop. "They have nothing to do with each other."      "What?" I said.      "Your microwave and your TV," he said. "Completely unrelated."      "Got it," I said. "But could you check the TV when you're done with the microwave, anyway?"      "I only do kitchen appliances," he said.      "But the TV is in the kitchen," I replied.

I put in a new fuse."      "I'm not so sure, Mike." I said assuredly. "I was on CNN and when I switched to HGTV, the microwave started to work again."

2019 first saw the widespread use of the phrase “OK Boomer” as a viral copy- and-paste response to a TikTok video in which an unidentified older man states that "...millennials and Generation Z have the Peter Pan syndrome: They don't ever want to grow up; they think that the utopian ideals that they have in their youth are somehow going to translate into adulthood."
 The movement gained further traction in the following weeks. Internet memes on sites that have largely millennial user bases, such as Reddit and Twitter, began popularizing the phrase as a catch-all reaction to the ostensibly dated values and beliefs of the infamously regarded baby boomer generation.
 Baby boomers comprise the demographic born between 1946 and 1964, aptly named for the sudden “boom” of pregnancies that occurred in the wake of World War II. Today, estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau place the current number of baby boomers at around 73 million, or roughly 22% of the country’s total population.

When the government listens to most of our phone conversations, all it learns is how frustrated we are at the cable company or how much bread our spouse asked us to pick up at the grocery store. But for the few people who discuss deep, dark secrets over the phone, there's now an Edward Snowden-designed iPhone case that can detect eavesdropping signals sent to the phone's internal antennas.
 It's called an "introspection engine," and it can sniff out the government- surveillance signals Snowden is famous for revealing.
 "If you have a phone in your pocket that's turned on, a long-lived record of your movements has been created," Snowden explained during a speech at MIT today, presented remotely. "As a result of how the network functions, your devices are constantly shouting into the air, via radio signals, a unique identity that validates you to the phone company. This is not only saved by the phone company, but can be observed as it travels, by independent, even more dangerous third parties."
 Developed in collaboration with fellow security expert Andrew Huang, Snowden's introspection device operates on a simple principle: if someone puts their phone in airplane mode, there should be no signals going in or out. If there are, the device alerts the user.
 The introspection device, currently just a prototype and not available for sale, is user-inspectable and relies on open-source software, according to Huang's description. It performs its signal monitoring independently of the phone's processor, to avoid false positive readings, and is undetectable by the operating system. In addition to cellular signals, it can also detect unwanted Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections.
 The pair conducted their research on a shoestring budget, but Huang said they could seek the necessary funding to develop and maintain a supply chain if the prototype is successful in field trials.
 Snowden sees the invention as primarily useful for journalists, who he said are most at risk of snooping using these signals when they are reporting on atrocities committed by governments during conflict zones, for instance.
 "Typically in such circumstances, a journalist wouldn't file reports until after they had left the conflict area, to avoid reprisals," Snowden said, referring to Syrian president Bashar Al Assad's surveillance of foreign reporters. "But what happens when you can't wait? When there are things a government is sort of arguing aren't happening, but are happening?"

All that technology can be — and obviously has been — used for cheating. The Houston Astros were hit with stiff punishment on Monday after an MLB investigation found the team used electronics to steal signs during the franchise’s run to the 2017 World Series title and again in the 2018 season. Manager AJ Hinch and general manager Jeff Luhnow were suspended for a season and then fired by Astros owner Jim Crane.
 Boston manager Alex Cora was fired on Tuesday for his involvement with the Astros’ scheme and a separate ongoing investigation that involves the Red Sox.
 Considering those developments, it might be wise to save players and coaches from themselves.
 A partial model is already in place: The NCAA's Southeastern Conference has used electronic communication between coaches and catchers during league games for the past two seasons, which allows the coach to talk strategy with the catcher through an earpiece. It's much like the NFL, where an offensive coach tells plays to a quarterback.
 No hand signals needed.
 “I don't know why everyone isn't doing it — it's fantastic,” LSU coach Paul Mainieri said. “It allows the coach to speak directly to the catcher and speeds up the game."
 In the SEC's system, the catcher still has to relay signs to the pitcher the old-fashioned way with hand signals, but Mainieri said there's no reason why pitchers couldn't eventually be included in the conversation. It's more common for coaches to call pitches in college, while catchers usually handle those responsibilities in the big leagues.
 MLB expects to show players some prototypes of pitcher-catcher communication devices at spring training camps this year, but there are no plans to put any of them in place.
 It would be unrealistic for a big league catcher to talk with the pitcher with a batter standing right next to him. Ole Miss coach Mike Bianco said there could be ways to work around that problem, suggesting that a clicker or some other device could be employed.
 Former MLB catcher Buck Martinez, who played 17 seasons, said the technology is available and today's generation of players would adapt to earpieces quickly if that's the route the sport wanted to take.
 “I think most of these younger generation kids have earpieces in their ears most of the time anyway,” Martinez said laughing, referencing the ubiquitous AirPods. “It's just normal. It would just be listening to baseball instead of music.”
 Under MLB's current setup, the sport has tried to draw a distinct line about what's allowed and what's not when it comes to sign stealing. It's a legal and time-honored part of baseball as long as it is done with the naked eye. Using technology is prohibited.
 There's a wide variety of opinion about how much technological cheating is actually happening and how effective it can be. Arizona Diamondbacks general manager Mike Hazen said in November that he didn't think it was a widespread problem.
 “I think MLB has done a really good job of cleaning up all of that stuff. It’s been a topic for a few years," Hazen said, shortly after the news broke that the Astros were being investigated by MLB. "There’s a lot of restrictions in place, there’s a lot of guidance in the clubhouse, oversight, in a good way."

Muzaffarabad [PoK], Jan 16 (ANI): A 12-year-old girl was found alive by rescue officials on Wednesday after being buried under snow for 18 hours in an avalanche in Pakistan-administered Kashmir (PoK) that engulfed her family house.   Samina Bibi recalled screaming and shouting for help as she lay trapped in a room under the snow, according to Al Jazeera.   "I thought I would die there," she said from a hospital bed in Muzaffarabad, where dozens of injured, including her, were receiving treatment after being airlifted out of the avalanche area.   A combination of heavy snowfall and bitterly cold temperatures since Sunday left at least 76 people dead in the region. The worst affected area was Neelum Valley, where the 21 bodies were retrieved, said Ahmad Raza Qadri, a minister for disaster management.   Meanwhile, Samina's mother, Shahnaz Bibi, who lost a son and another daughter, the rescue was nothing short of a miracle. After being pulled out of the snow earlier, Shahnaz said she and her brother, Irshad Ahmad, had given up hope of finding Samina alive.   Samina said she could not sleep while she waited to be rescued. Her leg was fractured and blood was oozing from her mouth.   "We didn't hear a rumble," Shahnaz said, recalling the moments before the avalanche buried the three-floor house where she and her family were sheltering with others from the village. At least 18 of them died.   Samina and her family were huddled around a fire when the avalanche hit. "It happened in the blink of an eye," Shahnaz said.   Pakistan's National Disaster Management Authority said the total number of deaths in snow-hit areas across the country over the past couple of days was now 100.   More heavy snowfall is expected in the region from Friday.   In neighbouring Afghanistan, the situation was returning to normal on Wednesday, following days-long heavy snowfall, rains and flash floods that killed 39 people and damaged about 300 homes since Sunday.

 “If you want to move up levels in the game, and I still have levels to go, a) you want to get to uncomfortable situations, and b) you want to have success in them,” he said. “And I think embracing that and not being scared of those moments is big, especially for younger guys who haven’t had that experience.
 “So being uncomfortable is a good thing; it means you have an opportunity in front of you with a chance to win. That’s what we play for.”

The former Duke star has missed the Pelicans’ first 41 games this season while rehabilitating from arthroscopic surgery to repair the lateral meniscus in his right knee. The timeline set for his return calls for him to miss three more games, starting with Thursday night’s home game against the Utah Jazz.
 New Orleans also hosts the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday and visit the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday.
 Griffin also indicated that Williamson's minutes will be closely monitored and likely limited for the time being.
 “From a sustaining health standpoint, we're certainly going to treat him differently,” Griffin said.
 The Pelicans have gone 15-26 without Williamson but have won nine of their last 13 to pull within four games of the final Western Conference playoff spot with half the season left.
 The 6-foot-6, 285-pound Williamson is relatively heavy for an NBA player, never mind one who moves well and often soars above the rim for the kind of dunks that have made him an internet sensation since high school in Spartanburg, S.C. The purpose of his mid-October surgery was to repair cartilage that serves as natural padding in the knee joint. So the team has taken a cautious approach to his rehabilitation in hopes of minimizing the possibility of a setback.
 Williamson returned to practice Jan. 2 and more recently has been seen dunking during Pelicans pregame warmup sessions.
 Williamson played in four preseason games before his injury, averaging 23.3 points and 6.5 rebounds. He had surgery in mid-October.
 He averaged 22.6 points per game at Duke during the 2018-19 season and also was voted to the ACC’s All-Defensive Team after averaging 8.9 rebounds, 2.12 steals and 1.8 blocked shots per game.

When freshman phenom Jada Williams joined the Blue Springs Wildcats this season, it seemed like it was going to give an already solid team a boost.
 However, that boost didn't manifest itself early in the season when Blue Springs lost three of its first four games.
 Recently, however, the Wildcats have put things together. They pushed their winning streak to seven games behind a team-best 15 points from Williams in a 42-30 rout of host William Chrisman Tuesday night.
 "We have a lot of talent on our team, but at the end of the day, we're playing well as a team," Williams said. "I am really excited. Everyone is running the floor and playing good defense."
 It wasn't a flashy performance. It was a defensive-heavy game in which Blue Springs held the Bears (3-4) to to 25 percent shooting from the floor and helped force 13 turnovers. That's been the key to the Wildcats' recent success, Spigarelli said, as his team had held its last seven opponents to just 37.3 points per game.
 "They are putting things together on both ends of the floor," Wildcats coach Mark Spigarelli said. "They are definitely doing that on defense, and they are getting better on offense."
 Williams has been part of that improved defense. She's improved herself since the start of the season as she added two steals and helped limit Chrisman's guards to just 1-of-18 shooting.
 "She made a real quick jump," Spigarelli said of Williams. "Her first two or three games, I didn't think she was putting enough pressure on the ball. Now she's putting all kinds of pressure on the ball."
 And that was key against the Bears since they have had to rely more on their perimeter players to score after last year's leading scorer, sophomore center Jacque David, tore her ACL last month. Blue Springs held junior Gia Moore, who scored 26 points in Chrisman's last game against Oak Park, to 0-for-11 shooting.
 "We've done some things to try and showcase our perimeter play," Chrisman coach Scott Schaefer said. "We still have capable people inside, so we may need to go there more. We will form a new identity a little bit. It takes a bunch of people to be able to do it."
 It was a struggle on offense in the early going for both teams as they were tied 10-10 after the first period before Blue Springs (8-3) went into halftime up 20-16. The third quarter is when the Wildcats started to take control. They allowed just one basket, a layup from Chrisman senior forward Annie Nauer. Meanwhile Blue Springs scored all eight of its third-quarter points in the paint as it took a 28-18 lead into the final period.
 Chrisman came as close as seven points (30-23) after Moore lobbed a pass to Jennifer David, who finished inside and totaled 11 points on 4 of 6 shooting. Then senior guard Jayla Sample helped seal it for the Wildcats, scoring six of her 12 points in the fourth, keying an 8-0 run that gave her team its biggest lead at 38-23.
 "I wouldn't have had any good looks late if it wasn't for my teammates," Sample said. "They were getting me open and passing me the ball."
 Despite the loss, Schaefer was able to take away some positives, including the play of freshman forward Mele Taula. She scored a team-high 15 points and grabbed five boards.
 "She's had moments," Schaefer said. "(The Wildcats) put so much pressure on our perimeter and for us to still get the ball inside and for her to still do something with it is pretty impressive."

WASHINGTON — The managers chosen to prosecute the impeachment case against President Donald Trump will make their case to all 100 senators. But to get the trial they want, they need just four Republicans.
 The House Democrats presenting the case at trial face the unique challenge of persuading a handful of senators to cross the aisle and join Democrats in demanding that the trial include documents and witnesses most Republicans would like to avoid.
 In a polarized era, even that modest goal could prove difficult. But it is Democrats’ only hope to avoid the abrupt acquittal Trump is seeking. How that phase plays out could shape the depth of the stain of impeachment on Trump’s legacy, but also the fortunes of many of the senators who will be on the ballot in November along with the president.

Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], Jan 15 (ANI): India wicket-keeper batsman Rishabh Pant will miss the second ODI against Australia in Rajkot as he will undergo rehabilitation protocol at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) after getting hit by a bouncer on Tuesday.   The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) said that the player is "stable" and his "scan reports are clear."   "He is stable and all his scan reports are clear. He has been discharged from the hospital and will head to the NCA, Bengaluru, to undergo his rehabilitation protocol. He is ruled out of the 2nd ODI. His availability for the final ODI will be based on how he responds during the rehabilitation protocol," said BCCI in a statement.   Pant was hit on his helmet by Australia pacer Pat Cummins while batting in the first ODI at Wankhede Stadium here. Pant got a concussion and took no further part in the game. He was then taken to the hospital for overnight monitoring under a specialist.   KL Rahul kept wickets for India in the absence of Pant. In 44th over, Pant got hit on the helmet when he was trying to pull the bouncer.   In the first ODI, Australian openers David Warner and Aaron Finch's centuries paved the way for the side to register an easy victory over India. Australia now lead the three-match series with a 1-0.   The two teams will next lock horns in the second ODI at Rajkot on January 17. (ANI)
