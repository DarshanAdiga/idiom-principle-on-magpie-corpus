Anna kicks off the segment with her solo for the song “For the First Time in Forever.”

As with so many other consumer areas, sex products are becoming environmentally aware. Because the only thing you want to screw is your partner - not the planet. Check out condom brands like Jonny that eschew petrochemicals for natural materials like latex and come in biodegradable bags so you can pop used condoms in the bin instead of flushing them down the drain where spermicides can have a detrimental effect on marine life. While you're down there, invest in some Good Clean Love lubricant. It's the first carbon- neutral product of its kind and relies on aloe vera, xanthin gum and agar to get the job done

Ridiculed by the Sydney press as too old, too slow and two years too late, Langer made them eat their words, setting up three tries with sleight of hand, grubber kicks and inside passes. Then, 14 minutes into the second half, he slid towards the line, was rolled on his back and reached out for a try which sent the 49,441 fans at ANZ Stadium into a frenzy. He called it the greatest night in his life. Many of those there, and even more watching at home, would say the same thing.

SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — The construction industry is booming in New Mexico and economic development officials in the southeast corner of the state are expecting even more from the industry in 2020. The Associated General Contractors of America reports the state was ranked No. 2 in the nation in October and November for construction job growth. Both months marked more than 11% year-over-year gains. The only other state with better numbers was Nevada at over 13%. New Mexico moved up to 52,300 construction workers, adding 5,300 jobs since November 2018. That's still short of the all-time high of 59,600 in June 2006, according to contractors association. A dominant share of New Mexico's increased construction is in Eddy and Lea counties, which are located in the middle of an oil boom that has taken hold across Permian Basin. The shortage of qualified construction workers across the country — and in Southeast New Mexico — is the only thing holding the Carlsbad and Hobbs areas from even more construction, the Santa Fe New Mexican reported. “If we could build 2,000 apartments overnight, we could fill them immediately,” said Missi Currier, CEO of the Economic Development Corp. of Lea County. “In residential, we are far behind where we need to be.” Carlsbad had four hotels under construction and another half-dozen in the works. Hobbs plans to break ground on a 32-bed Covenant Health hospital and a career technical education high school in 2020. Even with all the residential, school and hospital construction happening, a large share of work is related to the building of new infrastructure and drilling pads for the oil industry.

We couldn't even get tickets for a riverboat ride--they were sold out. Entire college bands floated down the river playing their school's fight songs, followed by boatloads of football players.
