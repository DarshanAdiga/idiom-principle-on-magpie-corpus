The nation's first coronavirus vaccine green light comes under a new interim order system that allows for accelerated approval very similar to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's emergency use authorizations.
 "The approval of the vaccine is supported by evidence that it is safe, effective and of good quality," Health Canada said in a statement. The vaccine has initially been authorised for use in people 16 years of age or older.
 Canadian officials have said that under their procurement deal with Pfizer, doses would not be shipped to Canada until the vaccine won Health Canada approval.
 Canada will start receiving its first doses of Pfizer's vaccine before the end of December, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday.
 The UK, on Dec. 2, was first to approve the Pfizer vaccine, which in a large clinical trial was 95% effective at preventing illness.
 Pfizer is responsible for shipping its vaccine, which requires ultra-cold storage, to warehouses across Canada.
 Canada has a firm order for 20 million doses of the vaccine, enough to inoculate 10 million people, with options to buy up to 56 million more.
 For the most part, provincial and territorial health systems will administer the shot, for free, across the country. They will have final say over how to use scarce early supplies in their jurisdictions.
 According to preliminary guidance published by the federal government in early November, vulnerable people and those who look after them are high priority, including long-term care residents and some healthcare workers.
 Canada has ordered more shots per capita than any other country.

Olivia's white privilege was discussed during _Red Table Talk_ , when Adrienne Banfield-Norris explained (via _Harper's Bazaar_ ), "I think for me, it's like, there is so much violent dehumanization that the Black community has to go through on a daily basis. Right? There is so much devastation particularly this year, 2020, with the pandemic and everything being brought to the table, just how there's so much inequality and inequity that when you come to the table with something like this, it's like, 'Child, please!'"
 She continued by pointing out that because of Olivia Jade's white privilege, she will likely be just fine after this scandal (which isn't everyone's reality due to systemic racism in the criminal justice system):
 "I'm exhausted with everything that we have to deal with as a community, and I just don't have the energy to put into the fact you lost your endorsements or you're not in school right now," Adrienne said.

 # On way out, Kennedy talks of 'messy and complicated' nation
 Matt Murphy
 BOSTON — After eight years in Congress, U.S. Rep. Joseph Kennedy III said goodbye on Wednesday in five minutes, thanking family and constituents and speaking of his hopes for the country and the House that he is leaving.
 Kennedy, 40, gave up his seat to run for the U.S. Senate, where his grandfather and his uncles had served before him. But his high-profile primary challenge to U.S. Sen. Edward Markey came up short, leaving the Newton Democrat's future uncertain.
 "To my constituents back home, I am so grateful for the trust that you put in me. My proudest moments were when you allowed me to bring your voice to this chamber," Kennedy said Wednesday morning from the floor of the House, where he delivered his farewell address.
 Kennedy represents the 4th Congressional District, which spanned the western suburbs of Boston to the South Coast. He joined Congress in 2013, succeeding Barney Frank at the age of 32 and going on to win reelection three more times.
 His seat will be filled in January by Jake Auchincloss, the Newton city councilor who prevailed in a crowded Democratic primary and went on to defeat his Republican opponent in the general election. Kennedy departure is the only change to the state's 11-person delegation to Washington.
 Kennedy leaves Congress just two years after being tapped by Speaker Nancy Pelosi to deliver the Democratic response to President Donald Trump's first State of the Union address in 2018. He was considered a rising star in the party, and some even thought he might run for president in 2020.
 Kennedy did not speak about his own future, however. He spoke instead about his desire to see Congress and government be more inclusive in who it serves.
 "I leave this body proud and hopeful, because this is what I know. That we are a complicated and messy country. That we violated our founding promises before the ink was dry," Kennedy said.
 Kennedy said the "We the people" mentioned in the opening lines of the Declaration of Independence referred to rich, white, protestant men, and the ideals of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness were paid for with slavery. But he said with every passing generation the definition of "we" has been expanded.
 He challenged his soon-to-be-former colleagues to reject the "great lie of these times that the American pie is finite, that for my family to survive, yours must suffer."
 "My hope is that in the months and years ahead this body can help change that. That we will err on the side of expansion, of inclusion and acceptance, of equity and grace. Because history makes clear that the only true error is when we do the exact opposite," Kennedy said.
 While Congress is preparing to break for the holidays and his time left in office is short, Kennedy continues to file legislation. He partnered with U.S. Rep. Richard Neal of Springfield on Wednesday to introduce a bill that would strengthen safety standards at Soldiers' Homes around the country after an outbreak of COVID-19 at the Holyoke Soldiers' Home in western Massachusetts led to the death of 76 veterans and sparked multiple investigations.
 The Kennedy-Neal bill would, among other things, require the administrator or deputy superintendent of any soldiers' home to have a medical license similar to what is required of skilled nursing facility administrators, and require all veterans homes to employ an infection preventionist.
 In a sit-down television interview with WPRI 12 in Rhode Island that aired Tuesday, Kennedy said he had no regrets about his decision to run against Markey.
 "I don't regret anything about that race," Kennedy said. "I don't regret my decision to enter it. I don't regret the campaign that we ran. I obviously wish the outcome were different."
 He did not rule running for office again, and acknowledged that he has been in contact with President-elect Joe Biden's transition team.
 But in the meantime, Kennedy said he owes his wife Lauren some at-home time.
 "Tell Ellie and James that dad has breakfast, bath and school dropoff duty for the next 15 years or so," Kennedy said.

With USD having taken such a beating in recent weeks, and with short positions looking as stretched as ever, perhaps it is about time markets saw some USD respite.
