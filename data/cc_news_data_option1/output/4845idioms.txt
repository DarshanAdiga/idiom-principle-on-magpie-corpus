 # What if, on Thanksgiving, we were grateful for our freedom?
 Andrew Napolitano
 Special to the USA TODAY Network
  _"Government requires make-believe. Make believe that the king is divine, make believe that he can do no wrong or make believe that the voice of the people is the voice of God. Make believe that the people have a voice or make believe that the representatives of the people are the people. Make believe that governors are the servants of the people. Make believe that all men are equal or make believe that they are not."_
 — Edmund S. Morgan (1916-2013)
 What if the government's true goal is to perpetuate its own power? What if the real levers of governmental power are pulled by agents and diplomats and by bureaucrats and central bankers behind the scenes? What if they stay in power no matter who is elected president or which political party controls either house of Congress?
 What if the frequent public displays of adversity between Republicans and Democrats are just a facade? What if both major political parties agree on the transcendental issues of our day?
 What if the leadership of both political parties believes that our rights are not natural to our humanity but instead are gifts from the government? What if those leaders believe the government that gives gifts to the people can take those gifts away?
 What if the leadership of both parties gives only lip service to Thomas Jefferson's assertions in the Declaration of Independence that all persons "are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness" and that the sole purpose of government is not to redistribute wealth or provide goods or services such as health care, but to protect these rights?
 What if the leadership of both parties quietly dismisses those ideas as Jefferson's outdated musings? What if Jefferson's words have been enacted into federal law that all in government have sworn to uphold?
 What if the leadership of both political parties believes that the constitutional requirement of due process somehow permits mothers to hire doctors to kill babies in their wombs, out of fear or convenience? What if the leadership of both political parties believes that the president may lawfully kill any foreigner out of fear, because due process is an inconvenience?
 What if recent presidents from both parties have used high-tech drones to kill innocent people in foreign lands with which America was not at war and claimed that they did so legally, relying not on a declaration of war from Congress but on the erroneous arguments of a former attorney general who falsely opined that American presidents can kill with impunity?
 What if the Constitution requires a congressional declaration of war or due process whenever the government wants anyone's life, liberty or property, whether convenient or not and whether the person is American or not? What if due process means a fair jury trial, not a secret killing?
 What if most members of Congress from both political parties believe in perpetual war and perpetual debt? What if the political class believes that war is the health of the state? What if the leadership of that class wants war so as to induce the loyalty of its base, open the pocketbooks of the taxpayers and gain the compliance of the voters? What if the political class uses war to enrich its benefactors? What if the government has been paying for war by increasing its debt?
 What if the $27 trillion federal government debt has been caused by borrowing to pay for wars and false prosperity? What if the federal government collects about $3.4 trillion annually but spends about $7.6 trillion? What if the feds borrow money to pay $350 billion in interest annually?
 What if it is insane to borrow money to pay interest on borrowed money? What if American taxpayers are still paying interest on debts incurred by Woodrow Wilson, FDR and every post-World War II president?
 What if the banks have borrowed the money that they lend? What if they can't pay it back? What if the stock market is soaring on money borrowed at artificially low interest rates?
 What if the government demands transparency from us but declines to be transparent to us? What if government leaders assert the make-believe that they work for us but recognize silently that we work for the government? What if the federal government has access to all of our communications, bank accounts, health and legal records, and utility and credit card bills? What if the government knows more about us than we know about it?
 What if the federal government stays in power by bribing the states with cash, the rich with bailouts, the middle class with tax cuts and the poor with welfare?
 What if the government thinks the Constitution is make-believe and doesn't apply in bad times? What if it thinks it can cure disease by quarantining the healthy? What if it mocks the Bill of Rights?
 What if the government the Founding Fathers gave us needed our permission to do nearly everything? What if today we need the government's permission to do nearly anything?
 What if, on Thanksgiving Day, our gratitude is not to the government that assaults our freedoms and steals our wealth but to God, who gave us our freedoms and our ability to earn wealth?
 What if, on Thanksgiving Day, our gratitude is for life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness and the exercise of free will and human reason? What if these are integral to our humanity despite the government's assault on them?
 What if, on Thanksgiving Day, we are most grateful that we are free creatures made in God's image and likeness? What if we can use our freedoms to reject the government, make-believe or not?
 Happy Thanksgiving.

French authorities on Tuesday opened an investigation and ordered suspensions of police after they were filmed beating up a black music producer in central Paris in images that sparked new anger over the conduct of the security forces.
 The images published by the online news site Loopsider showed the music producer, identified only as Michel, being repeatedly beaten as he tried to enter a music studio in the 17th district of Paris.
 The incident comes after a string of high-profile probes into police violence against black and Arab citizens and as concern grows over new legislation that would restrict the right of the press to publish images of the faces of police.
 The man was himself initially arrested for violence and failure to obey the police. But prosecutors threw out the probe and instead opened an investigation against the police officers themselves for committing violence while in a position of authority.
 "I am asking the chief of (Paris) police to suspend on an interim basis the police officers concerned," Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin wrote on Twitter.
 The man's lawyer, Hafida El Ali, told AFP that his client had been detained for 48 hours on the basis of "lies by the police who had outrageously aggressed him".
 Paris prosecutor Remy Heitz told AFP that he had asked France's National Police General Inspectorate (IGPN) to shed light on what happened as quickly as possible.
 "It is a very important case in my opinion and I have been following it personally," he said.
 \- 'Exceptionally serious' -
 Loopsider, which has exposed several episodes of police brutality in recent months, said that the images "had to be seen to understand the full extent of the problem".
 Loopsider said Michel had initially been stopped for not wearing a mask and subjected to racial abuse by the police.
 "People who should have been protecting me attacked me. I did nothing to deserve this. I just want these three people to be punished according to the law," Michel told reporters on Thursday as he arrived at the IGPN with his lawyer to file a complaint.
 Paris' Socialist mayor Anne Hidalgo said she was "profoundly shocked" "by an intolerable act... that is exceptionally serious."
 A close ally of President Emmanuel Macron, parliament speaker Richard Ferrand, also expressed alarm, writing on Twitter that illegitimate use of force by the police "eroded the indispensable link of confidence between citizens and those who protect us, and must be punished without weakness."
 There has already been virulent criticism of the police this week after they used tear gas late Monday to remove migrants from a camp set up in central Paris.
 Prosecutors have opened probes into the use of violence against both a journalist and a migrant in that incident.
 The beating of the producer now piles new pressure on Paris police chief Didier Lallement who has faced stern questions from critics and media over the dispersal of the migrants.
 \- 'Would still be in prison' -
 The lower house of parliament Tuesday evening gave initial approval to a security bill which would restrict the publication of photos or videos of police officers' faces, although it still faces further legislative hurdles.
 Media unions say it could give police a green light to prevent journalists from doing their work and potentially documenting abuses.
 "If we did not have the videos (of the beating of Michel), my client would be in prison," lawyer El Ali said.
 Macron swept to power in 2017 as a centrist who rallied support from across the political spectrum. But critics and even some supporters accuse him of tilting to the right as he seeks re-election in 2022.

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — An annual holiday tradition of touring elaborate holiday displays at homes in and around Richmond will continue this year, but there won't be quite as many lights. The Tacky Lights Tour is still set to begin this weekend, although some longtime participants will skip it because of the need to limit crowds and maintain social distancing during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The over-the-top holiday displays typically attract long lines of cars, buses and limos filled with people who get out and walk around so they can see the lights up close. Al and Esther Thompson on Wendhurst Drive in Glen Allen — one of the most recognizable houses on the tour — have decided to cancel their annual Grand Illumination on Thanksgiving night, an event which usually attracts hundreds of people. Instead, the Thompsons will light up their display on Friday. They've also posted signs saying that no more than 25 people will be allowed to stand in front of the house to comply with the state's restrictions on gatherings. Thompson said he's also sent letters to limousine and bus companies that host Tacky Light tours, notifying them of the crowd limitation and asking them not to unload their guests. “I’m very serious about this. I want people to be safe and I’m trying to do the best I can (to keep people safe),” he told the Times- Dispatch. The Thompsons' home, which features over 170,000 lights, won $50,000 on ABC’s “The Great Christmas Light Fight” in 2016. The Live Grinch at 1411 Pennsylvania Avenue won’t be making any live appearance this year, but his house will be lit and fully decorated. “It was a really difficult decision to make,” said Brett Aliotti, who dresses up as the Grinch every year and poses for photos with fans. “But...

LONDON (AP) - Scottish lawmakers have unanimously passed legislation that will make period products freely available to anyone who needs them - a move that leader Nicole Sturgeon says makes Scotland the first country in the world to do so.Lawmakers in the Scottish Parliament unanimously approved a bill late Tuesday that will require local authorities to provide free access to items such as tampons and sanitary pads.Monica Lennon, a lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party, had campaigned against “period poverty” — when someone who needs sanitary products can’t afford them — since 2016. She described the legislation as “practical and progressive,” especially during the coronavirus pandemic.“Periods don’t stop for pandemics and the work to improve access to essential tampons, pads and reusables has never been more important,” she said. “On the issue of period dignity, I am beyond proud that Scotland is leading the way and we have moved at a fast pace in a short space of time.”Her bill was passed in a 121-0 vote after winning the support of the Scottish government and the other opposition parties in the legislature in Edinburgh.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that she was proud to vote for the “groundbreaking” legislation and described it as “an important policy for women and girls.”Under the bill, the Scottish government must set up measures to allow anyone who needs period products to get them free of charge. Schools and universities must make the products available for free in their bathrooms.The Scottish government already funds free period products in schools and universities, but the bill makes it a legal requirement.Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell from the Scottish National Party hailed the passing of the legislation as a “significant moment for gender equality.”And Rose Caldwell, chief executive of the girls’ rights charity Plan International U.K., said Scotland could soon become the first country to eliminate period poverty once and for all.A 2017 survey by the charity estimated that 10% of girls aged 14 to 21 in the U.K. have been unable to afford period products, and 15% of girls have struggled to afford them.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

MERIDIAN, Idaho (AP) — Police in southwestern Idaho say two officers responding to a report of a drunk driver on Wednesday opened fire after the driver attempted to evade arrest and struck an officer with her vehicle. Meridian police say 43-year-old Michele Green then fled the area but was forced to a stop after running over spike strips and an officer rammed her vehicle. Police say they then discovered that Green had been shot in the arm. Police say Green was taken to an area hospital for treatment and then booked into the Ada County Jail. She is facing charges of felony battery on a police officer, felony eluding a police officer, misdemeanor driving under the influence and misdemeanor resisting and obstructing. She's being held without bail. It's not clear if Green has an attorney. Police say the officer struck by Green’s vehicle was also taken to a hospital where the officer was treated and release.

Burkina Faso's President Roch Marc Christian Kabore has won a second term after gaining an outright majority in the first round of elections, the country's electoral board announced Thursday.
 "Mr Kabore... with 57.87 percent of the vote, is provisionally elected president of (Burkina) Faso in the first round," said Newton Ahmed Barry, head of the Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI).
 Eddie Komboigo, the candidate of a once-ruling party, came second in Sunday's vote with 15.48 percent of the ballot, followed by Zephirin Diabre, considered by pundits to be the best-placed opposition hopeful, with 12.46 percent.
 Kabore, 63, has been under fire for his response to a five-year-old jihadist insurgency that has rolled in from Mali.
 But he was the favourite and by winning an overall majority in the first round he avoids a runoff vote in which he would have had to stand against a single candidate backed by a united opposition.
 The elections on Sunday were for Burkina's legislature as well as its presidency, where executive power in the former French colony is concentrated.
 The paramount court, the Constitutional Council, has a week in which to confirm the outcome.
 One of the poorest countries in the world, Burkina Faso is struggling with a jihadist campaign that has claimed at least 1,200 lives since 2015 and forced around a million people to flee their homes.
 Opposition parties say the vote was marked by fraud and flawed procedures, threatening to reject "results stained by irregularities."
 Their complaints include polling stations that either did not open or opened late, insecure handling of ballot boxes and arbitrary changes to voting areas.
 Because of the unrest, the election was not held across at least one-fifth of the territory, denying up to 350,000 people the right to vote, according to CENI's figures.
 Pro-Kabore parties on Tuesday argued that all candidates were equally affected by the problems and that in any case these were not on a scale to have any major impact on the result.
