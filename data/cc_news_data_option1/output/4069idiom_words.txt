“If we want antibodies that will persist for a few years and protect us, it’s not clear that’s going to happen,” he said.

The economy has been slow to recover as COVID-19 continues to spread rapidly in India, home to the second-highest number of virus cases in the world.

“We need to study the T-cells,” said Swapneil Parikh, who worked with Shastri on reinfected hospital workers. “Is the virus doing something to the immune system that is setting you up for more severe infections?”

It would also buy bonds issued by state governments as a special case. Usually it contains this tool only to federal debt.


--DocBreak--
If and when the infection is beaten, the T and B-cells stand down, but the body stores some for years as immune memory that can be recommissioned if the virus tries again.

That poses another problem, University of St Andrews social psychology professor Stephen Reicher said.

To confirm a reinfection, scientists must examine the genetic code of the virus from each round of illness and prove that they are distinct, which means having access to both sets of swabs and the wherewithal to do whole genome sequencing. Even in hospitals where the capacity exists, such tests are rarely done. Reinfected patients simply go unnoticed or unreported.

Pillai failed to find any, suggesting that the patients were unable to generate highly effective, long-lasting antibodies that would fight the virus for years.

People who have recovered from COVID-19, and many who falsely believe they had it, might believe that they are protected in a second wave.


--DocBreak--
The finding, and similar cases, has refocused attention on a handful of questions that scientists are struggling to answer: What does protective immunity look like? How long does it last? Do some patients fail to mount the right response? Does the virus damage the immune system? Are reinfected people infectious to others?

Imperial College London immunology professor Danny Altmann guesses that those who recover from COVID-19 have perhaps 90 percent protection for a “fair while.” But how long is that?


--DocBreak--
In a report on reinfected healthcare workers in India, Jayanthi Shastri and her team at Kasturba Hospital for Infectious Disease in Mumbai describe a 25-year-old nurse who suffered more with a reinfection two months after her first battle with COVID-19.

He believes that the same problem might also arise in people with milder COVID-19 infections.

RBI had previously allowed banks to hold more government bonds without marking to market, which the central bank is to extend until March 31, 2022, with conditions, it said.

If the virus spreads further through the autumn and winter, Iwasaki expects to see more reinfections, with some patients infectious enough to pass the virus on.

“Her immunity wasn’t enough to protect her from the second, more severe infection, despite the presence of neutralizing antibodies,” Shastri said.


--DocBreak--
The immune system’s battle against COVID-19 is unleashed in several waves. The first line of defense, the innate immune system, is imprecise but fast. Invading pathogens prompt cells to churn out signaling proteins called cytokines, which call in an army of white blood cells that engulf and disrupt the virus.


--DocBreak--
“It’s really hard to find a pattern right now,” said Yale University immunobiology professor Akiko Iwasaki, who has been closely following cases of reinfection. “Essentially, every case is different.”


--DocBreak--
The virus can certainly disrupt the immune system. In August, Shiv Pillai, an immunologist at Massachusetts General Hospital’s Ragon Institute, examined tissue taken from dead COVID-19 patients.


--DocBreak--
Another possibility is so-called antibody-dependent enhancement — a glitch in the immune system where antibodies help an invading virus rather than hinder it. This is seen in dengue fever, where a second infection can be far more dangerous than the first.


--DocBreak--
“I don’t see why the vaccines won’t work. They may not be fantastic, but I believe that’s what’s going to protect us,” he said.


--DocBreak--
Given the complexity of the immune response, it is no surprise that scientists are struggling to unravel why reinfections occur. Blood tests on patients reveal that virus-disabling antibodies can wane after a few months, particularly in those with mild or no symptoms, but even with healthy levels of antibodies, reinfection not only happens, but can cause more serious disease.


--DocBreak--
He looked for structures called “germinal centers” in the spleen and lymph nodes. These are where B-cells go to develop antibodies before they are stored in the immune system’s memory.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development forecasts the economy to shrink 10.2 percent this year, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc predicts a 14.8 percent contraction.

Next to gear up is the adaptive immune system, a more specialized attacking force. This unleashes T-cells, which destroy infected cells, and prompts B-cells to make antibodies that stick to viruses and stop them from spreading further.

The governor said that the central bank stands ready to take further measures on liquidity, and announced a range of steps, such as easing a corporate cash crunch through 1 trillion rupees (US$13.7 billion) of targeted long-term funds with tenors of as much as 3 years to banks for investing only in corporate bonds.


--DocBreak--
Yet another possibility is that the virus harms T-cells, in some patients at least.

Sovereign bonds have advanced, as yield on 10-year bonds fell 7 basis points to 5.95 percent.

“We suggest that GDP growth may break out of contraction and turn positive by” the fiscal fourth-quarter, Das said.

The good news is that a vaccine should not cause the same problem as the virus.

“I think it is important, all ways round, to dispel the myth of invulnerability,” Reicher said.


--DocBreak--
As only about 25 reinfections have been confirmed worldwide in a pandemic that has infected more than 30 million people, reinfection seems uncommon, but scientists point out that confirming reinfection is no easy task and many cases are missed.


--DocBreak--
The RBI sees inflation easing close to 4 percent in the fiscal fourth-quarter ending March — the midpoint of its 2 to 6 percent target band. It sees GDP contracting 9.5 percent in fiscal 2021, but a faster rebound is feasible.

“There is probably a lot more than we are seeing,” Iwasaki said.

“I would bet my house on you being safe for possibly a year, but not much longer,” he said. “The problem is that whenever an immunologist says anything about COVID immunity to a journalist, it is right for about two weeks and then it’s completely wrong.”
