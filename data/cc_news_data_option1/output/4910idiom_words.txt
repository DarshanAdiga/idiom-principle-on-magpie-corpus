All of the quarterbacks were told to self-isolate to comply with the league's COVID-19 protocol.¬†            The quarterbacks had gathered for film study Tuesday, but did not wear masks or socially distance, which the NFL discovered after looking at surveillance footage. The Broncos said Saturday that Lock, Rypien and Bortles "have consistently tested negative for COVID-19" and weren't experiencing symptoms.            "I feel like maybe (the game)¬†could have been moved, but at the same time, maybe the league was making an example of us as far as maybe not doing the things we needed to do in that particular room, that quarterback room,'' Jackson said. "Obviously, the guys didn't follow their protocols, and for (the NFL)¬†to see that, I guess they felt like they had to make an example, so at the end of (the)¬†day, it is what it is.            Hinton, 23, only had one completed pass attempt, finishing¬†1-for-9 with 13 yards and two interceptions. The Broncos had only 112 yards of offense.
