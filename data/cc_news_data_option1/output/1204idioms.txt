Trump clearly "cares more about the Dow than saving lives," and now he's "being goaded on in this sadistic plan to put profits over lives by CEOs, economic advisers, and fringe characters on the right who are actually suggesting that it might be worth letting some people die in order to save the economy," he said. "Glenn Beck accused Democrats of wanting to pull the plug on Grammy, and now 10 years later he's saying the stock market's down, Grammy's gotta go."

  The campaign highlights a different local business every day. That business generally offers a special deal for the day, Klein said.


  To start the Rally Wahoo campaign quickly, they assigned Nygren’s downtown Wahoo flower shop, Found and Flora, the first spot on the calendar.


  Nygren said she got a lot of response from the email message sent out by the Chamber to alert the community of the new campaign.


  “Even before we were truly open the phone started ringing,” she said.


  Nygren thought she had enough flowers in her inventory to handle the specials, which included $20 “Friday Flower,” but she was wrong. She ended up having more flowers delivered to fill orders.


  Before the Rally Wahoo campaign started, Nygren had been using creative means to draw in customers. She had her 8-year-old daughter, Evie, demonstrate how to make an arrangement on social media. After that, customers asked for kits to do what Evie had done.


  Nygren made eight kits and sold six in 30 minutes, she said.

Both groups are pushing for a massive "wage-subsidy program." More specifically, the CFIB is asking government to "implement a 75 to 90 per cent wage subsidy program" and the Business Council notes that "the proposed 10 per cent wage subsidy for small businesses was a step in the right direction … But more needs to be done." Business council president Goldy Hyder said businesses are saying, "I want to do everything I can to keep my employees. The best model is, pay me to pay them."
 While we certainly agree that the federal government's temporary wage subsidy is unlikely to help prevent layoffs, what isn't needed is another massive government wage subsidy program -- particularly a program that could be rife with potential fraud and abuse and take significant time to organize and administer so as to actually get money into the hands of Canadian workers.
 A better way forward is to boost Employment Insurance (EI) benefit rates while allowing employers to temporarily lay off workers without the need to provide severance.
 It's important to understand temporary layoffs do not signal an end to the relationship between employers and workers, particularly in this environment. Rather, this is a temporary situation where the relationship is ongoing and there's an understanding that the person's job and compensation will more than likely resume in the near future. If it doesn't within a pre-defined time, then indeed the layoff would be permanent and normal severance would apply.
 Although temporary layoffs are permitted by various provinces' employment standards legislation, common law has developed to limit or, worse, in effect ban temporary layoffs. Fortunately, some jurisdictions have already recognized this problem and are taking steps to provide employers more flexibility. New Brunswick, for example, recently suspended the requirement for employers to give notice or pay severance if layoffs are due to COVID-19. Other provinces and the federal government should follow suit.
 Workers temporarily laid off would be eligible for Employment Insurance, which the federal government has already adjusted. Indeed, recent expansions to the EI program have increased both benefits and eligibility for workers, helping to ensure those who face either job loss or a reduction in hours receive proper income support.
 Governments could also temporarily increase the EI benefit rate and/or level of income covered. For example, Ottawa could immediately raise the percentage of income replaced from the current 55 per cent to 70 per cent and the maximum income covered to $81,300 (one-and-a-half times the current maximum of $54,200).
 This would be markedly better than creating a new program that requires a new system of eligibility requirements, a new distribution system, and a new system of monitoring to ensure money actually flows to employees and fraud is prevented.
 In addition, Ottawa could loosen regulations regarding additional income earned or received while laid-off workers receive EI benefits. This could allow limited temporary work for laid-off employees and potential additional top-up payments by any employers in a position to do so. Current EI regulations limit or prohibit these types of additional payments.
 Again, the immediate goal is to stabilize income for both workers and employers in the most effective manner possible so as to steady the economy while the government and health professionals get control of the spread and treatment of COVID-19.
 After the economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19 subsides, the EI program must, of course, revert back to normal levels. Crucially, many emergency measures introduced now must be undone eventually, to avoid impeding economic recovery. We need them now. They would do damage later.
 To increase income-support measures most effectively, best piggyback on existing programs and make it easier for Canadians to access and receive the support they need rather than create entirely new government programs.

What a dilemma. Some outliers made the cut for fans, but one must realllly think carefully about which club members would be assets. Obviously, Jax should make the cut (with one hoping that no vital decisions should be made), and then you'll need someone to crow, "Jackie Boy!" all the time, which means that Chibs is in as well. As for the third option, one must choose wisely. I mean, Bobby makes some mean banana bread, if you're into that sort of thing. Tig would make a great party companion, but that's not so good for the social distancing aspect. Juice would get overly emotional and hog all the tissues, so nah, not him. Happy's good with weapons, so don't count him out. And Clay? Who am I kidding, no one in their right mind would choose to hang out with Clay.

The ultra-Orthodox population of Jerusalem comprises some 39% of the city's approximately 983,000 residents. As the virus crosses all demographic boundaries, it has erupted in haredi neighborhoods throughout the capital, sending hundreds of ultra-Orthodox residents into isolation at home or in hospitals. While some behaviors by haredim during the pandemic have raised criticism and even expressions of hate, it is clearly a difficult time for the ultra-Orthodox community.


  "Let's put aside for a moment the medical aspect, and consider the economic impact on that sector," said Moshe Yossef Lefkovitch, a member of the tiny Alexander Hassidic sect.


  "The quasi-majority of the 13,000 residents of Mea She'arim - to which we have to add about 5,000 or 6,000 foreigners who come from the USA or England to study here - all these people live thanks to donations from the large hassidic population abroad. Well, this is finished. The coronavirus has hit them there, too. As a result, this year, not a penny will come from there."


  According to Lefkovitch, about $1 billion in donations comes from abroad into the local haredi community every year for Passover.


  "It covers everything - shoes, clothing, food, hats, hassidic outfits - absolutely everything. And right now, two weeks before Passover, nothing is coming in. This is a catastrophe, perhaps no less dangerous than the virus itself, since many of these people have no other income."


  Asked why so many actions by haredim and decisions made by their spiritual leaders in recent weeks did not respect Health Ministry rules, Lefkovitch said this was another tragic aspect of the crisis.


  "In universities and high schools there is an extensive use of the Internet and all these devices to learn from home, but in the yeshivot of the haredi sector, hassidic and Lithuanian alike, this is out of the question. The rabbis are so afraid of the Internet all the time, so now, in a time of crisis, they are even more against it. So at first, they refused to change anything, and then ruled to study in small groups in separate, smaller classes. But even that is not working."


  "They live in very small apartments," Lefkovitch said. "Now, all of a sudden, seven, eight or even nine children come back home and they are literally living on top of each other. That, obviously, is not exactly protecting against propagation of the virus. These are terrible times for this community."


  Asked if the crisis could be a test for believers, Lefkovitch said it is exactly the opposite. Lefkovitch explained that in times of crisis and threat, the rabbis call for repentance, fasting and adding more prayers as a means to alleviate danger. He said that news about so many yeshiva students in Israel and America, along with some revered rabbis, becoming ill is adding to the anxiety and fear.


  Ironically, after meeting for the first time with official high-ranking members of the government, the Eida Haredit - an organization representing several hassidic streams that reject Zionist ideology and do not recognize the State of Israel - were among the first haredim to take strict measures to protect their communities from the virus by closing their yeshivot.

February saw a 5% increase in domestic abuse reports in contrast to the same time the previous year just as the novel coronavirus began to spread wildly throughout the globe, according to N12.


  The police, according to Minister of Public Security Gilad Erdan, will begin especially rigorous supervision of violations in the realm of domestic abuse due to increased risk.


  According to several organizations which reported the rise in abuse, the increased social distancing along with the excuse of economic tensions have created a hotbed for domestic violence.


  The police will therefore be carrying out regular check-ups at the homes of families in which women were feeling threatened or at risk.


   _Maariv_ , the sister publication of _The Jerusalem Post,_ reported that despite several branches of welfare services being listed as critical, which allows them to operate in the time of coronavirus, 60% of social workers in the field of domestic abuse are not currently working.


  "These social workers perform critical and unique services that respond to populations which, without regular treatment, may very will be harmed or harm others," the Social Workers Union warned this past week.


  "Stopping funding of programs at local authorities these days as a result of the lack of [funding] is scandalous and irresponsible," said Social Workers Union Chair Inbal Hermoni in a letter presented to Shaul Meridod, head of the Budgeting Department at the Treasury.


  "These days, I am sure it goes without saying why the different welfare programs must continue functioning, albeit in a different format, while adjusting medically," she explained. "It seems as though the Finance Ministry is taking advantage of the coronavirus crisis to cut welfare budgets which are passed onto local authorities, thereby effectively hampering their ability to care for at-risk residents at all levels."


  She stated that, among others, these at-risk communities includes women affected by domestic abuse.


  Joint List MK Aida Touma-Suleiman addressed Welfare Minister Ofir Akunis this past week to ask for urgent support for women's shelters in light of the current crisis, according to Globes.


  In Touma-Suleiman's letter, she wrote that "The instructions of the Health Ministry and of the Prime Minister's Office to stay home... is making relief organizations and women's shelters face challenges they have not yet known."


  Throughout 2019, women's organizations throughout the country reported a steep rise in reports of domestic abuse. Throughout that same year, 13 women were murdered in acts of domestic violence.

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

Oh yeah. Things are different. Really different. For everyone.
 We’re living in a Stephen King novel. A world where one of the most heroic things we can do is disappear.
 School yards, ball fields, watering holes, shopping centers, office buildings — eerily quiet. Traffic whisks through legendary bottlenecks such as the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel.
 Before Monday’s decision to shutter tons of businesses, traffic at the HRBT already was down 200,000 vehicles for the month compared to the same period last year, according to the Virginia Department of Transportation.
 At the Monitor-Merrimac, it was down 340,000.
 The nosedive expected this week? Unparalleled.
 But just like cheap gas — under 2 bucks in our region now — those wide-open lanes aren’t much good if there’s nowhere to go.
