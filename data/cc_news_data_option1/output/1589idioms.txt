The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRSs requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting year. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of the amount, events or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. The Directors consider the following to be the key estimates applicable to the financial statements, which have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year or in the long term:
