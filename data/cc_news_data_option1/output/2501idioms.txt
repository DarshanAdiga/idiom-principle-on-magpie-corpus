The debate about minaret calls in Denmark has rumbled on for several months, ever since a mosque in Gellerupparken, near Aarhus, played the call from a local football field instead of from the mosque, as the latter was shut due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 It was the first time a public call to prayer had been heard in the Scandanavian country, and lawmakers have been debating its legality.
 The resolution put forward by the four parties this week does not specifically mention Islam or any religion, referring instead to a ban on prayer calls using speakers in a public place.
 Rasmus Stok _lund, a spokesman for the ruling Social Democratic Party, says the government "essentially agrees"_ that prayer calls shouldn't be allowed in Denmark, and Integration Minister Mattias Tesfaye is investigating the legality of having them banned.
 However, the proposed ban would potentially violate the constitution if it is aimed specifically at Islam, and there are fears that it could affect Christian churches too, if the law is too broad.
  _" If we make legislation now, we also run the risk of it hitting the church bells of the Danish Church, and that we are on edge with constitutional rights on religious freedom and various conventions,"_ Stoklund said.
 Calls to prayer violate regulations in many countries, but the laws are being relaxed in some places. Denmark's neighbor Sweden first allowed them to be played in public in 2013.
 The issue has also been debated in the UK, in recent months, as mosques there were permitted to call worshipers to personal prayer through loudspeakers for the first time, so as to encourage them to stay - and pray - at home amid the coronavirus pandemic. The development prompted calls from leading clerics for the practice to be allowed to continue in the future.

Questo comunicato ho deciso di postarlo proprio per raccontarvi dell’accaduto di ieri!….naturalmente la signora era informata…ma molto probabilmente ci voleva provare!…apparte questo…sono qui a dirvi di non credere a ciò che e’ stato scritto su testate anche perché ho i legali stanno provvedendo a rettificare la fake news che hanno scritto!…ma mi viene comunque da pensare ad una cosa…come hanno fatto le testate a scrivere ciò… bhe ve lo spiego subito… naturalmente qualcuno come al suo solito si diverte a dare notizie sbagliate ad infangare il lavoro degli altri e a puntate il dito ad una persona come me che lavora h24 specialmente per questo paese #anzio dove ho cercato di dare un immensa visibilità sia con il programma “il salone delle meraviglie” e sia con la frequentazione assidua di tantissimi personaggi che hanno e frequentano il mio salone….allora mi viene da chiedere…perché nessuno dice e scrive nulla ?! Bhe’ perché fa comodo scrivere solo ciò che fa comodo a loro! Io sono onesto e ne sono fiero di ciò che ho fatto e di ciò che ho costruito da SOLO dando anche visibilità al mio paese di nascita al quale io sono legato….ma putroppo questo paese non merita tutto il mio affetto! A malinquore mi viene da dire…questo è ‘ ANZIO !

 Thanks to a big fourth inning, the Dallas Center-Grimes baseball team picked up their seventh straight win in a 5-0 victory over conference foe Indianola.
 Efficiency could very well describe the Mustangs and their offensive production. DCG plated those five runs on just four hits in what was a pitching duel for the most part. Seniors Chase Stratton, Logan Smith, and Colby Wigham along with junior Jordan Sedivec all picked up hits in the contest. Wigham, Sedivec, Bryce Jermeier, and Cody Hall were responsible for four of the five runs that crossed the plate for DCG.
 The visiting Indians actually kicked off the overall scoring, staking an early 1-0 lead in the top half of the second inning. The DCG offense truly was funneled into one single inning which turned out to be the fourth inning of action. Two walks and a Chase Stratton single set the stage for Sedivec to strike for his only RBI of the game, doing so on a single to center field. Hall followed that up with a hard-hit ball that forced an Indianola error for the first and only needed lead of the game for the Mustangs.
 Bryce Jermeier joined the scoring parade but he did so with patience as with the bases already full of Mustangs, the senior watched four straight pitches go by for balls which earned him a free pass to first and brought home one more run. Boley reaching on an error and a Wigham RBI ground-out produced the final two runs of the inning and ultimately the game as the defense held strong for the 5-1 victory.
 On the mound, just two pitchers were needed to capture the win for the Mustangs. For a third straight outing, Logan Smith dazzled on the mound, allowing just three hits and the first earned run against him this season. It marked the second straight outing of eight or more strikeouts for Smith as he dished out exactly eight strikeouts against the Indians Wednesday night. All that came with issuing just one walk.
 The win has now provided DCG their best seven-game start to a season since the 2012 campaign when they started the season 8-0. The Mustangs will have the chance to earn their best start in over ten years as they take on Pella Christian Thursday, June 25 in a doubleheader battle in Dallas Center. Since 2014, DCG holds the match-up advantage winning 11 of the last 16 contests against the Eagles. Game one from Dallas Center is set to get the doubleheader started with first pitch at 5:30 p.m.

Bankwest Stadium's surface will come under the spotlight after Sydney Roosters lost two players to serious knee injuries in their 26-12 win over St George Illawarra.
 Luke Keary again showed why he is the form five-eighth in the game with a stellar second half to guide the Roosters home, after they were reduced to 15 men after 22 minutes.
 But the story of the night was the injuries.
 Victor Radley and Sam Verrills went down untouched in the opening 22 minutes, with the ground looking patchy following its recent heavy workload.
 The Roosters fear both have suffered season-ending torn anterior cruciate ligaments.
 Radley went down after charging out of the line in defence in the eighth minute.
 Verrills followed him 14 minutes later, going down as he took a simple run mid-field and falling before the defensive line.
 While there was no formal complaint, and no suggestion at this point the surface contributed to the injuries, a Roosters trainer is believed to have told the NRL's ground manager boots had been getting stuck in the surface.
 "The stadium turf has been holding up well under a heavy playing schedule," a Bankwest Stadium spokesman said.
 "Signs of wear and tear are a result of the winter rye grass not getting sufficient time to grow between events, but extensive pre-game testing has indicated the surface is stable and safe.
 "Any injuries to players are a concern.
 "The stadium team will work with the NRL and clubs to ensure the best possible surface for each and every game."
 With NRL venues limited during the coronavirus, there will have been 11 matches in 22 days at Bankwest by the end of this weekend.
 There are three more scheduled for next weekend, with clubs preferring the venue given it can host 7,500 fans from next month - around three times more than suburban grounds.
 The NRL moved a game from Campbelltown to Kogarah this weekend in a bid to play on a fresh surface.
 Already without James Tedesco (concussion) and Josh Morris (calf) the Roosters were stretched to the limit in terms of player availability.
 Down 12-10 early in the second half, it appeared they could be set for their first loss since the competition's resumption.
 But it was then Keary stepped up.
 The former South Sydney playmaker had the Roosters back on top when he grubbered for Brett Morris to score in the 52nd minute, before doing it all himself in the 66th to give his team control.
 Keary then put the icing on the cake with a pinpoint perfect kick for Morris to have complete a hat-trick in the dying minutes after the winger also got the Roosters' first.
 Joseph Manu, deputising for Tedesco at fullback, also had one of the plays of the season early in the game.
 He chased through on his own bomb to leap high and take the ball from Matt Dufty, before flicking it back for Jared Waerea-Hargreaves to score.
 Dufty was the Dragons best, providing a bullet two-man cut-out ball for Mikaele Ravalawa for the Saints' first try.
 He then helped them level the scores before the break, when he found a flying Zac Lomax who ran a nice inside line to go over and make it 10-10.
