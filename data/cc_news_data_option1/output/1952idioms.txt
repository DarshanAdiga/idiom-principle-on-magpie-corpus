Fox Renewal Watch: Will Prodigal Son season 2 happen at Fox?

Continuous Planning is the modern framework for financial planning and decision-making in business. It's both a vision and a culture. It's the recognition that business is continuous and therefore planning and decision- making should be too. Business advantage comes from being nimble, agile, and smart with your capital. Business leaders need to be able to respond to changing conditions at a moment's notice in order to capitalize on new opportunities, protect against threats, and remain competitive and positioned for success.

There may not be any immediate reason for hurry or panic here -- given the fact that _Prodigal Son_ is not being planned for the fall, Fox can take their time over the next several weeks. The earliest that we could theoretically expect it back on the air is in early 2021, though some more information will likely come out about that in due time. (Fox in general is delaying much of their schedule to ensure that it is safe for productions to go back to work.)

So that scene at the boardwalk?
 There was a baby fox, you see — a whole family of foxes, in fact, newly taking up residence beneath the boardwalk.
 For a few weeks starting in April, it seemed as if all anyone was talking about, other than the virus, were the foxes — mom, dad and four kits. Or was it five? No one was really sure.
 There were reports of people picking up the kits and hand-feeding them. Paparazzi assembled at dusk and dawn, hunting for shots of the kits in the honey light beloved by both photographers and, it turns out, foxes. They made the national news.
 At first, they were a welcome distraction. But they quickly became a full-on attraction.
 “I watched a lady trying to take a selfie with the fox in the background,” said Erwin Buck, a retired advertising executive-turned-local-photographer who lives nearby. “People have been locked up for the last six to seven weeks and this is the first excitement they’ve seen. They go overboard.”
 The poets and philosophizers of Toronto think there is more behind the city’s captivation with the fox family.
 They are wild and free, when the rest of us feel trapped. They are new, beautiful life, while we are transfixed with death. And they offer hope that maybe we can make it through these hard times.
 Foxes, after all, are highly adaptable, able to flourish in almost any environment. In literature, they are the classic tricksters, emerging unscathed from every deadly snare.
 “They are full of courage, full of wit, full of resource and unremitting effort to survive,” said Al Moritz, Toronto’s poet laureate.
 Still, for all their survival skills, these foxes had made their den under the busy boardwalk in the city’s Beach neighborhood, just 5 miles from downtown. I live five blocks away. While I went there regularly before lockdown, now it is my one precious, daily escape.
 So I worried.

The Clarets finished 13th in the Championship that season, with Blake netting nine goals, before the club embarked on one of the most memorable campaigns the following year.


  A wonderful FA Cup run meant they came within a whisker of Wembley, downed by Spurs in extra time of an enthralling semi-final, before Coyle steered the Clarets to promotion through the play-offs.


  The cup tie with Spurs saw Burnley overturn a 4-1 White Hart Lane reversal with a 3-0 Turf Moor success to force extra time, only to concede twice and fall just short.


  But the defeat fueled the promotion desire.


  Speak to any Burnley player from that 2009 side and they will tell you the confidence was coursing through the squad ahead of Wembley clash with Sheffield United.


  The Clarets had beaten the Blades twice in the regular season and seen off Reading in the semi-finals.


  That confidence had come from Coyle and served Burnley well in the opening half of their Premier League campaign/


  "He was the best bluffer," said Blake of Coyle's ability to instill belief in players.


  "Even though you were playing against players who were miles better than you he made you feel that you were better than them.

Meanwhile, _The Resident_ has an enormous international following and while it may not be the network's top-rated drama, it performs reasonably well and has a lot of DVR viewing/streaming to boot. Also, there is plenty of subject matter for the show to take on when it comes back. In general, though, don't expect either _The Resident_ or _Last Man Standing_ back until early 2021, as they are not a part of Fox's fall schedule -- it's one that is looking at the global health crisis and recognizing that, more than likely, these two shows are not going to be able to return to work with their typical production schedule plan in mind.

SAVANNAH, Ga. -- A video released Monday shows police in Georgia attempting to search Ahmaud Arbery's parked car in 2017 and when he declines to let them and begins to walk back to the vehicle, an officer tries to use a stun gun on him.


   


  The video, first obtained by The Guardian, shows Arbery repeatedly declining when a Glynn County police officer asks to search his Toyota. A backup officer arrives, and tells Arbery "don't reach the car" and "keep your hands out your pockets." This second officer then attempts to use a Taser, but the device just clicks loudly, without apparent effect. Arbery is told to get down on the ground, and he goes to his knees.


   


  When Arbery questions why the officers are bothering him, he's told that the area is known for drugs, a suggestion that agitates Arbery, who said he is not on drugs and to check his "s---!" The first officer then pats him down looking for weapons, saying this was just a check, not a search.


   


  Absent probable cause or a court-issued warrant, police generally aren't allowed to search a parked car without permission.


   


  In a police report, also obtained by The Guardian, officers said Arbery, who was parked when confronted, was free to go but could not take his vehicle because his license was suspended. The report said that after he left the scene they noticed Arbery's passenger side window was cracked open and that they smelled what they believed to be marijuana and noticed a bag with a leafy substance inside.


   


  Calls and emails to the Glynn County Police Department and Abery's family attorney Benjamin Crump have not been returned.


   


  Arbery was killed Feb. 23 after a pursuit by a white father and son who armed themselves and gave chase after seeing the 25-year-old black man running in their subdivision. More than two months passed before a video of the killing emerged, sparking an outcry. Gregory McMichael, 64, and Travis McMichael, 34, were then jailed on charges of felony murder and aggravated assault.


   


  A judge from outside the coastal Georgia community where Arbery was fatally shot has been appointed to preside over trial proceedings of the two men charged with Arbery's murder, including one defendant with close ties to law enforcement.


   


  Court documents filed in Glynn County show that Superior Court Judge Timothy R. Walmsley was appointed to the case after all five judges in the legal circuit where Arbery was killed recused themselves. Walmsley is based in Savannah, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) north of where the slaying occurred just outside the port city of Brunswick.


   


  Gregory McMichael, a retired investigator for the local district attorney, told police he thought Arbery was a burglar. He said Arbery attacked his son before he was shot.


   


  Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, has said she believes her son was merely out jogging.


   


  The delay in criminal charges and a cellphone video of the shooting leaked shortly before the May 7 arrests fueled national outrage over Arbery's death.


   


  Last week, defense attorneys for the McMichaels cautioned against rushing to judgment. They said they soon plan to seek a preliminary hearing from a magistrate judge in Glynn County at which new details might be revealed. They also plan to ask that the McMichaels be released from jail on bond pending trial. That decision will now fall to Walmsley.


   


  No court hearings had been scheduled as of Monday afternoon.


   


  Gregory McMichael worked as an investigator for the local district attorney for more than two decades before he retired last year. Attorneys for Arbery's family and others have blamed the delay in arrests in part on the elder McMichael's ties to local law enforcement. The McMichaels weren't charged until after the Georgia Bureau of Investigation was brought into the case in early May.


   


  Meanwhile, three district attorneys have passed on prosecuting the case, which now resides with the district attorney of Cobb County in metro Atlanta.

PROVIDENCE -- If you didn't know better, you'd think it was a pretty good day of business for Plant City.
 A steady stream of customers came by the takeout booth at the vegan food hall near the Providence River to place orders early Monday afternoon. Cars pulled up on South Water Street for curbside delivery. And seven of 19 tables on a patio or under a nearby tent were occupied by people sitting down to sip iced coffee or nosh on a tofu chicken sandwich.
 But business, though steady, was good only in the broader context of the coronavirus outbreak, and considering that this was just the first day that Rhode Island's restaurants were allowed to reopen for outdoor dining.
 On a normal weekday before the pandemic, as many as 1,000 people would cycle through the establishment's four restaurants. On a Saturday or Sunday, twice as many could come by. The number on Monday, even including the 20 reservations that had been made for dinner, was clearly going to be well short of those standards.
 Still, owner Kim Anderson was appreciative of all the customer support and excited to take another small step back to normal.
 "I don't care that I make a lot of money, but I can't lose a lot either," said Anderson, who was in the parking lot greeting customers. "You have to live to fight another day."
 When Rosanna Ortiz heard on Friday that Plant City would be starting up outdoor dining service, she immediately made a reservation.
 "It almost made us emotional to be here," said Ortiz, of Providence, a Plant City regular who had lunch with her friend Caroline Silva.
 "It's just good to be out," said Silva, a New York City resident who's been living with her family in Seekonk during the COVID-19 crisis.
 Not all restaurants were as busy as Plant City on Monday. The Newport Creamery in Garden City in Cranston set up a special outdoor seating area in a parking lot, but despite the many people who stopped by to pick up orders, nobody had made reservations to stay and eat outside.
 "We had a lot of interest over the weekend, so I'm sure we'll have reservations," said district manager Katelynn Dodson. "I know a lot of consumers are looking forward to it."
 At Avvio Ristorante, an Italian restaurant on the other side of the shopping plaza, business was also slow. There were three reservations for lunch and dinner on Monday, said general manager Raul Esteves.
 In order to comply with state guidelines specifying eight feet between tables, the restaurant had to reduce the 15 tables that would normally be on the outdoor patio to seven. Staff were also stepping up the amount of cleaning they had to do. Before any diners arrived, they were seen disinfecting door handles and any other surfaces people would touch.
 The restaurant would usually have five servers for the patio. On Monday, three were at work. Esteves said they'll see how business goes before deciding if more staff can come back. He was happy to start table service again.
 "I'm ecstatic to get back into it," he said.
 At Plant City, Anderson said a lot of preparations had to be made to get ready for dine-in customers again. At the top of the list was bringing back another 30 staff members, all with masks provided by the business. The total number of people at work at Plant City is now more than 80, which is short of the 200-person workforce from last summer.
 One headache was the tent Anderson ordered -- a necessity to ensure that she could keep serving food even if the weather turns. The tent didn't arrive as scheduled on Friday, so she drove to a UPS warehouse in Warwick the next day and stood outside with a sign asking for help. After a couple of truck drivers saw her, a manager found the tent and she was able to take it herself.
 On each table under the tent was a note reminding customers to wear their masks when they're not eating or drinking or when an employee approaches them. "Thank you for protecting our staff and other guests," it says.
 "We're being cautious and prudent, and we're following the best safety and health protocols that have been given us -- and then some," Anderson said. "We want to do the right thing."
 Danny Vallejo, of Central Falls, said he chose Plant City as the first place to eat at again because he saw that the business was following strict standards during take-out service. He also was careful in not coming for dinner, or on a weekend when more people could be out.
 "I came to a trusted place and I came at a time that wasn't too busy," he said. "I was a little nervous about it, but they did what they had to do, and I would come back."
 Ortiz was also happy with all the precautions that the business took. After finishing her lunch -- she had the truffle burger -- she was already thinking of coming back again.
 "I'll definitely be here one more time this week," she said.

The Portland Gale of 1898 is remembered as the deadliest weather event in New England maritime history. The Thanksgiving weekend storm claimed over 450 lives along the coast, including 192 aboard the doomed steamer S.S. Portland.


  Forty other vessels were destroyed or damaged, including the 344-ton schooner Albert L. Butler near the Peaked Hill Lifesaving Station in Provincetown on the morning of November 27, 1898. Two of the crew and a passenger were lost.


  "The sailors perished as a result of their own rashness and lack of self possession, when they might have certainly have been saved," according to the U.S. Lifesaving Service report of 1899.


  "The passenger, from Jamaica, fell from the rigging while the schooner was plunging shoreward, and was beyond any help either from the vessel or the land. The sailors perished as a result of their own rashness and lack of self possession, when they might have certainly have been saved. The passenger, from Jamaica, fell from the rigging while the schooner was plunging shoreward, and was beyond any help either from the vessel or the land."


  The Butler, with a crew of seven, was heading from Jamaica to Boston with a full cargo of logwood. Already having encountered rough seas, the storm intensified as the vessel was 40 miles off Highland Light in Truro. After more progress to the north, the ship was driven by northeast gales toward shore. Captain Frank Leland figured that his ship "made a dead drift of about 15 miles."


  By 7 a.m. the next morning, the ship was approaching Peaked Hill Bars, considered to be one of the deadliest stretches along the Atlantic coast. Leland described the sea as "frightful, the biggest I ever saw, and the gale swept us at its mercy."


  The vessel drifted for three hours until about 10 a.m., when "the shore breakers were under her forefoot, and she swung broadside high onto the beach."


  While on patrol, Peaked Hill surfman B.F. Henderson and High Head surfman Benjamin Kelley spotted the Butler when she struck the sandbar, and quickly relayed the information to the Peaked Hill Station. Shortly after 11 a.m., the apparatus was ready at the wreck scene. Keeper Cook fired two shots from the Lyle gun from a high bank, and a sailor on board the Butler began to fasten the whip line. However, he failed to do so efficiently, and the man ended up being dragged through the breakers to shore.


  Shortly after, the mizzen mast gave way and crashed, fouling the rigging and whip line. Two men panicked, and, despite warning from the surfmen, tried to go in as the man before them did. As the keeper said, "A big sea, I should say 20 feet high, rolled in and buried the vessel, men and everything. I had hold of the whip line, and could feel when the sailors lost their grasp. They were washed off, and that was the last we knew of them."


  Leland washed ashore on a piece of wreckage. He and two other men were pulled up while trying to climb the bank.


  "If they (the lost men) had worked the lifesaving lines properly, they would doubtless have been saved," said Leland. "They were all used up and badly scared, hardly in a condition to do things in an orderly and sensible way."


  By day's end on November 27, debris, lifejackets and bodies from the S.S. Portland began washing ashore in the same location. The wreck remained on the beach for several weeks, with the masts and fittings stripped by Cape wreckers.

NEW YORK - Walmart became one of the few lifelines to millions of people as the coronavirus spread, leading to surging profit and sales during the fiscal first quarter.


  Online sales in the U.S. jumped 74% for the quarter ended April 30, which captured the brunt of the pandemic. Same-store sales rose 10% at U.S. Walmart stores on strong sales of food, health and wellness goods.


  At a time when a huge swath of stores that sell non-essential merchandise temporarily shut down, the nation's largest retailer had the natural advantage of carrying the very items that consumers needed during the pandemic.


  But unlike its online rivals like Amazon, Walmart enjoys an extensive network of nearly 5,000 physical stores and a variety of delivery and pick-up options that it ramped up to meet crushing demand for essential items from paper towels to canned food. Walmart's reputation for low prices also helped as the unemployment rate has spiraled to the high level since the Great Depression.


  “Having a wide range of fulfilment options, including delivery to home, collection from store — and by using stores for fulfilment— allowed Walmart to ramp up capacity in a way that many other players struggled to do,” said Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData Retail. “We also believe that by using stores effectively, Walmart mitigated some of the higher costs associated with the online channel.”


  Walmart shoppers did not limit their purchases to just essential items, using their federal stimulus checks to buy clothing, TVs and video games, which helped boost sales in April. Walmart also said it's seeing gains in new customers from across all income brackets.


  At the same time, company had trouble keeping its shelves stocked and its inventory fell 6.1%. Costs soared as well, to the tune of $900 million — all of it related to the pandemic. Cash bonuses were issued to all hourly workers and Walmart upped pay by $2 per hour at its warehouses. It rolled out an emergency leave policy and spent money on shields at checkout lines. Still, it reported a higher operating profit.


  Walmart pulled its guidance for the year, citing the chaos of the pandemic. It also pulled the plug on Jet.com, an online startup that it bought for more than $3 billion in 2016 as it sought to ramp up online operations to compete with Amazon.


  Before the pandemic, there was already a broadening gap between big box stores and mall-based chains that had struggled to follow customers online. The crisis has accelerated that trend, pushing clothing chains further into peril.


  J. Crew, J.C. Penney, Neiman Marcus and Stage Stores have all sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection this month. Pier 1 Imports, Inc., which filed for Chapter 11 in February, said Tuesday that it’s winding down its business after stores are able to reopen and it can conduct liquidation sales.


  Home Depot and Kohl's on Tuesday also joined Walmart to report the full impact of COVID-19 on financial operations, and revealed the vast disparity between those allowed to keep their doors open during the outbreak, and those that were not.

Master-Bilt’s manufacturing facility in New Albany is closing permanently, the company announced Tuesday.


  “Refrigerated Solutions Group today announced that after a full review of its business opportunities, market conditions and other options, it reached the difficult but necessary decision to begin the process of permanently closing its manufacturing facility located in New Albany, Mississippi,” a statement from the company says.


  The statement added, “Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused sudden, dramatic, and unexpected conditions outside of the company’s control. The unprecedented and major economic downturn and the governmental-forced closures of many of RSG’s customers have contributed to these unforeseeable business conditions.”


  Product manufacturing will be consolidated to RSG's Hudson, Wisc. facility by Oct. 31. The RSG warehouse facility in Guntown will remain an ongoing warehouse and distribution operation.


  “RSG is committed to maintaining the Master-Bilt brand and will continue to support our customers, sales representatives, service agents and channel partners,” said CEO Kevin Fink.


  Fink continued, “We wish to extend our appreciation to our employees, customers and channel partners for their support over the years of the Master- Bilt brand and throughout this manufacturing change.”


  In business for over 80 years, Master-Bilt manufactures a complete line of refrigerated coolers and freezers for commercial foodservice applications.


  Master-Bilt’s markets of specialty include restaurants, institutional settings, small footprint retail and convenience stores.


  Master-Bilt was recently sold by Standex Refrigerated Solutions Group of Salem, N.H. to Ten Oaks Group of Charlotte, N.C.

NEW YORK - The-Dream has won Grammys for his songwriting skills, but the performer doesn’t plan to break down the formula for his latest hit, the Megan Thee Stallion “Savage” remix co-starring Beyoncé.


  The viral song, which has reached the No. 2 spot on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart, has nine songwriters listed on the track, including The-Dream, Jay-Z, Beyoncé and Megan Thee Stallion.


  “It’s not about revealing the magic of how things happen and how they come about. And it’s not for me to say the breakdown of how a thing is done,” the four-time Grammy winner said in an interview with The Associated Press. “I mean, everybody knows what I do so I’m definitely not in the part of my career where I have to say, ‘Yeah, I did so and so and then I did this part.’”


  The-Dream has steadily penned hits for nearly 15 years for megastar artists like Beyoncé, Rihanna, Mariah Carey and Justin Bieber, while also vocally assisting hip-hop heavyweights such as Jay-Z and Kanye West.


  The 42-year-old, who has also written hit songs for himself, said he felt a strong connection to Megan Thee Stallion on a personal level since they both lost their mothers.


  “It’s just one of those things where you gravitate toward artists that we feel like ... (you) have something to say.

Forming a pod like this requires a lot of trust. You do want to make sure that your pod rules are clear and that everyone is committed to following them to the letter. You should also probably confirm that you are in general agreement with the other adults when it comes to parenting styles, since you’re essentially becoming daytime co-parents. It might not be a bad idea to stipulate some kind of “out” clause if the arrangement isn’t working well. (Remember that you’re likely going to be living near these people long after the pandemic ends.) But for your sake and the sake of your fellow pod members, I certainly hope it succeeds in making your lives a bit more manageable during these challenging times. Good luck!

Donald Charles Smith passed away peacefully on May 15, 2020, just short of his 92nd birthday. He is survived by his lovely wife, Evelyn, with whom he shared more than 70 years of life together. He was born in Detroit, and as a young boy his family moved to the Waterford/Clarkston area. He graduated from Clarkston High School, and attended Central Michigan University, where he majored in Accounting. Don met the love of his life during their college years. They were married at Waterford Our Lady of the Lakes Catholic Church. Don and Evie created a family of 7 children, 14 grandchildren, and 7 great- grandchildren “all because two people fell in love.” Don built and owned a successful business, World Credit in Pontiac, which he operated for over 30 years. When he wasn’t working, Don loved every outdoor sport imaginable, and made a point of sharing the adventures with his family and friends. He was a musician, playing Dixieland and jazz in the Oakland County area.

"The vision for Romania's development in the coming years will be based on innovation competitiveness and massive investments in transport, energy, but also in healthcare infrastructure. It is a vision which starts from healthy economic principles, which will support, in a sustainable manner, the prosperity of Romanians. What we need to do now - and here I call for the support of all credible political forces and the business milieu - is to provide confidence to employees and entrepreneurs. Unfortunately, we have a bill left by previous governments which greatly limits our space for intervention. That is why, we are focusing our efforts on being prepared to access all available forms of support, including the new financial instruments which the European Commission is currently working on. In conclusion, the priorities in the next period are to maintain the health of our citizens and the economic recovery," President Iohannis told a media briefing held at the Cotroceni Presidential Palace.      He underscored that there are no economic sectors which had not affected to a greater or lesser extent by the coronavirus pandemic.      The head of state talked about opportunities and remarked the boost in the digitisation of administration.      "Institutions quickly adapted, from the ones in the labour area or the financial sector, to granting medical services online. It is a huge step forward, which it is mandatory to strengthen," Iohannis said.      He emphasised that it is not a restart of economy from scratch, because Romania's economy hasn't been completely stopped these months.      "There were important sectors which operated at full capacity, as it is the construction sector and the infrastructure one, which explains the economic growth in the first quarter," President Iohannis added.      The head of state carried out at the Cotroceni Presidential Palace, on Tuesday, two meetings with the Government members regarding the measures to manage the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Belmont Stakes will be run June 20 without fans and serve as the opening leg of horse racing's Triple Crown for the first time in the sport's history.


  The New York Racing Association on Tuesday unveiled the rescheduled date for the Belmont, which will also be contested at a shorter distance than usual. The 2020 Belmont will be 1 1/8 miles instead of the 1 1/2-mile “test of the champion” that has been the race's trademark for almost a century.


  This is the first time the Belmont will lead off the Triple Crown ahead of the Kentucky Derby and Preakness. The Kentucky Derby was moved from May 2 to Sept. 5 and the Preakness from May 16 to Oct. 3 amid the coronavirus pandemic.


  The Belmont was originally scheduled for June 6. But racing in New York halted in late March after a backstretch worker tested positive for COVID-19, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo didn't give the green light to resume until Saturday.


  Live racing is gradually ramping up operations across North America because tracks feel they can operate safely and still make money without fans on site because of online betting and TV revenue. More than $90 million was wagered off track last year on Belmont day, and NYRA gets a cut of that money along with revenue from NBC.


  Horse racing officials have grappled with the complexities of a shifted Triple Crown season that doesn't require the same of 3-year-olds in contention as it has in years past. The Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont are usually run during a six-week span in the spring.

With New York theaters dark until at least September, now may be a good time to watch, or re-watch, these 20th-century dramas about the backstage world of Broadway, starting with the gold standard and continuing through some of its lesser, but still interesting, silver-screen successors.


  "All About Eve"


  This 1950 drama starring Bette Davis as Margo Channing, a popular but aging Broadway star, and Anne Baxter as Eve Harrington, a young fan who wangles her way into her idol's life, is quite simply one of the best movies of all time.


  Nominated for a record 14 Academy Awards, "All About Eve" won six, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay for Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and Best Supporting Actor for George Sanders.


  It is also the only film in Oscar history to receive four female acting nods - Davis and Baxter for Best Actress, and Celeste Holm and Thelma Ritter for Best Supporting Actress - though all were shut out.


  Not a single word or gesture is wasted in this Mankiewicz masterwork.


  To watch Davis, in an Edith Head black silk crepe de chine cocktail dress, stop cold as she ascends the stairs of her spacious New York apartment to turn and deliver the film's most famous line is to experience excellence in writing, direction, acting, and costume and set design coming together for a truly indelible moment.


  "Fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy night," Margo tells her guests, signaling that the mood at the party she's hosting is about to darken.


  As the film's star, Davis lands her fair share of memorable lines in the screenplay, based on the 1946 short story "The Wisdom of Eve," by Mary Orr.


  There are plenty of other lines to go around, though, and a first-rate company to deliver them, including Baxter as the cunning and ruthlessly ambitious Eve, Gary Merrill as Bill Sampson, Margo's beau and frequent director, Hugh Marlowe as stalwart playwright Lloyd Richards, Holm as his well-bred wife, Karen, Ritter as Margo's sardonic maid Birdie, Sanders as corrosive columnist Addison DeWitt, and Gregory Ratoff as peptic producer Max Fabian.


  And, in a small role, a 24-year-old Marilyn Monroe plays Miss Caswell, a comely young actress mentored by DeWitt, who describes her as "a graduate of the Copacabana School of Dramatic Art."


  The characters are linked not only by Broadway but by success - how each defines it, what they'll do to achieve it, how they view it in others, and what they're willing to do to sustain it.


  So while "All About Eve" is set in the theater, its story is one for the ages - making this perfectly realized film worth seeing again and again.


  "Torch Song"


  Joan Crawford was on the short list to play Margo in "All About Eve," before a scheduling conflict took her out of the running.


  When it came time for Crawford to topline her own Broadway-set feature, however, she had to settle for this mediocre 1953 melodrama distinguished only by the fact that it marked her return to MGM after a 10-year absence.


  To welcome back the star it once called Hollywood royalty, the studio outfitted the movie queen in an array of eye-catching outfits and provided a series of mid-century modern sets on which to showcase the mid-career Crawford.


  Even an Academy Award winner like Crawford needs at least a somewhat decent script to make a picture work, though.


  Sadly, that's missing in this tale of Jenny Stewart, a hard-bitten Broadway star, and Tye Graham, her blind accompanist - a wooden Michael Wilding - making "Torch Song" only enjoyable for what it really is, a highly stylized vehicle custom-made for Crawford.


  What other value is there in John Michael Hayes' screenplay, which has Tye telling Jenny, "You have the mouth of an angel, but the words that come out of it are sheer tramp"?


  And since Jenny is a leading lady of the musical theater, some of those words are sung - although not by Crawford, who is dubbed by India Adams.


  Prepare to brace yourself when Jenny, inexplicably in black-face, sings "Two- Faced Woman." If your jaw doesn't drop to the floor, you've probably nodded off.


  "Black Widow"


  While promoting this 1954 whodunit, director and screenwriter Nunnally Johnson said it would be "the 'All About Eve' of suspense pictures."


  If only that lofty boast had proven even somewhat true.


  Giving Johnson the benefit of the doubt, that may have been the goal when, after both Joan Crawford and Tallulah Bankhead turned down the lead role of Carlotta "Lottie" Marin, he instead cast Ginger Rogers, famed not only for starring opposite Fred Astaire in a string of hit RKO musicals in the 1930s and '40s but also for her Oscar-winning role in the 1940 drama "Kitty Foyle."


  Rogers, as a snobby, acid-tongued Broadway actress married to the more subdued Brian Mullen, played by Reginald Gardiner, leads a terrific cast that includes Van Heflin as a renowned Broadway producer, a role declined by both Gregory Peck and William Holden.


  In supporting roles, there are Gene Tierney as Lottie's friend, Peggy Ann Garner as a 20-year-old aspiring writer, and gangster-movie legend George Raft as a police detective.


  Nothing against Heflin or Rogers, but since both were third choices, it was probably clear from the outset that "Black Widow" wasn't top-shelf.


  Johnson's uneven screenplay, based on Patrick Quentin's 1952 novel of the same name, and uninspired direction leave the strong cast visibly laboring to enliven this leaden murder mystery.


  "Valley of the Dolls"


  Jacqueline Susann's first novel, the 1966 bestseller "Valley of the Dolls," was a trashy page turner before it became this wild ride of a 1967 film adaptation.


  For the uninitiated, the titular "Dolls" are the barbiturates and other pills consumed, sometimes voraciously, by the movie's living dolls, Patty Duke as rising star Neely O'Hara, Barbara Parkins as Radcliffe graduate-turned- secretary-turned-model Anne Welles, and Sharon Tate as the ravishing, if not so talented, chorus girl Jennifer North.


  The action moves back and forth between New York and Hollywood, but the drama is at its peak whenever Neely lock horns with Broadway legend Helen Lawson, played by Susan Hayward.


  The suggestion that sharing a stage with Neely might benefit Helen causes Hayward, in full dudgeon, to sneer, "The only hit that comes out of a Helen Lawson show is Helen Lawson, and that's me, baby, remember?"


  When an argument between Neely and Helen devolves into a wig-pulling catfight, the movie reaches it high-camp apex.


  One of the film's highlights is its theme song, written by Andre and Dory Previn and performed to perfection by Dionne Warwick. The overall score is notable, too, for earning legendary composer John Williams his first Academy Award nomination.


  Is "Valley of the Dolls" a great movie? Of course not, but it's great fun nonetheless, and who couldn't use some of that right now?


  "The Fan"


  Lauren Bacall probably seemed like a natural to play the role of Sally Ross, a famous film and stage actress about to open in a new Broadway musical, in this 1981 big-screen vehicle.


  After all, Bacall - a Tony winner as Margo Channing in "Applause," the 1970 stage adaptation of "All About Eve" - was starring in another musical, "Woman of the Year," on Broadway that year.


  However, "The Fan," based on the Bob Randall novel of the same name, is neither a musical nor a traditional drama nor a comedy. It is a slasher film that, even at this stage of her film career, was beneath Bacall.


  That said, her 50-something Sally is the obsession of handsome 20-something Douglas Breen, played by Michel Biehn, a record salesman who moves in mere minutes from sending Sally mash notes to stalking her violently.


  Along the way, casualties - of both the script and the slasher - include Sally's secretary, her maid, and her show's choreographer.


  That last takedown comes too late to halt the musical's opening night, unfortunately, so we get Bacall in a few inexplicably awful musical numbers that might leave you headed up the aisle to the exit if you weren't on your couch.

The pandemic has prompted many to rethink how they spend their days.
   
 Now, one Bucks County group is hoping it will influence how communities and people spend and conserve their energy.
   
 "Ready for 100 Bucks" is mobilizing local communities to kick their dependence on fossil fuels and transition to clean renewable energy. The grassroots movement, which is gaining momentum in Bucks County, encourages the use of better home insulation, hybrid or electric cars, bicycles and public transportation where possible.
   
 The group kicked off in November 2019 as a local offshoot of the Sierra Club's national "Ready for 100" campaign. RF100 communities commit to transition to 100% clean, renewable energy for their electricity needs by 2035, and for all energy needs by 2050.
   
 "It's not an easy sell during a pandemic," said Jim Baldassarre of Doylestown Township's Environmental Advisory Council and leader of RF100 Bucks. "But the clock is ticking. The best science tells us that we have to act now if we want to have any chance of avoiding the worse effects of climate change. We won't solve this problem quickly, and can't afford a time-out."
   
 While the campaign set very clear goals, there isn't one recipe for every community. The plan begins with local governments passing resolutions to commit to the principles of Ready for 100, which include getting an energy audit to see where energy can be conserved. Doylestown Township is already on board, passing an RF100 resolution in March.
   
 "As we start to open up, decisions will be made. Projects will be approved. Vehicles will be purchased," said Jim Wylie, chair of the Sierra Club's Pennsylvania Chapter. "Let's be mindful of the energy commitments these decisions will be locking us into."
   
 He said about 30 municipalities in southeastern Pennsylvania have already signed on to Ready for 100, and he expects more to join in the coming months.
   
 "Let's not rush back to business as usual," Wylie said. "Let's consider how we can support the local job market with local energy jobs. Let's think about our commuting habits. Let's be safe, considerate and mindful of our future."
   
 In Montgomery County, Ambler, Radnor, Norristown, Haverford Township and Phoenixville are among those that have signed on. The Bucks County group has participants from Buckingham, Doylestown Township, Lower Makefield, Solebury, Southampton, Warminster and Wrightstown.
   
 Tanya Casas, who serves on Doylestown Township's EAC, said the group's goal is to get all municipalities in Bucks County on board.
   
 "I say 'ultimately,' but really, it's a matter of the sooner, the better. We can't wait for the pandemic to subside," she said.
   
 Baldassarre said clean energy solutions are becoming more affordable for governments, businesses and consumers. He said PECO offers incentives for LED lighting discounts for business and residential consumers.
   
 "Individuals can also choose to buy all renewable electricity right now," he said. "And of course, a home solar system is a viable option for some people ... It's very important to realize that transition to renewable energy is now also cost saving. Solar and wind electric are now cheaper than coal and will soon be cheaper even than natural gas."

So the next morning, Hultzen drove 2 miles from his apartment to Blair’s house. As he walked into the backyard, Hultzen thought to himself, “Damn, this is all you need.” He saw the wooden mound covered with turf that Blair had commissioned a carpenter to build; the mat backstop propped up against a giant trampoline belonging to Blair’s 6-year-old son; a radar gun; a projection board; and a Rapsodo machine, which provides tracking data on pitches. No frills, just the basics for a pro.


  “The whole ‘Field of Dreams’ concept,” Blair said of his setup, laughing. “Once I had a mound and a radar gun, it didn’t matter that my pad was attached to a trampoline — it was somewhere you could throw and talk to someone who’s in the same process as you.”

The committees for ward-level monitoring of the large number of people who will be returning home from overseas and from other States were formed in most wards by Tuesday. In addition to this, five area-level committees have also been formed in each of the wards.


  The civic body formed these committees as per instructions issued by the State government to all local bodies. As the Corporation had earlier formed groups of volunteers in each ward even before the lockdown to keep track of those in home quarantine, forming the committees was an easier task. The volunteers had, during those initial days, ensured that those in home quarantine did not get outside their houses. In a few such cases, warnings were issued.


  But, the new ward-level committees are a more formal arrangement. The members include representatives of residents’ associations, Janamaithri police, village officers, Kudumbashree members, volunteers, anganwadi teachers/workers, health workers from the National Health Mission, SC/ST promoters, ASHA workers, government employees, and representatives of political parties.


  “The main ward-level committees and the area committees have been formed in most wards. Their first meetings will be held on Wednesday, in which each of them will take stock of the situation in the wards, take the number and locations of people in home quarantine, and also identify persons in the neighbouring areas, who can keep track of their movements. But, now with people being more aware than in the initial days, we do not expect a lot of them to try and move outside their houses,” said a Corporation official.


  Aiding them in the monitoring activities will be the mobile application ‘COME’, with one or two officials in each area committee being given login access to it, to feed the local-level data. Information about those breaking quarantine will be immediately handed over to police officials, and the offender will be shifted to an institutional facility.

  Allentown expected to spend nearly $550,000 on temporary wages this year and about $700,000 overall on the aquatics program, including some winter activities. Swimming pool fees generated $281,000 in revenue last year, and the city expected to bring in $310,000 this year.


  Bethlehem operates five pools: Clearview, Stark, Westside and Yosko, as well as Memorial Pool, the city’s flagship community park which had been undergoing a $5.2 million reconstruction and was set to reopen this summer.


  The 63-year-old pool on Illicks Mill Road has been closed since 2018.


  “As frustrated and disappointed as we all are, we do need to follow Governor Wolf’s guidelines. Currently Lehigh County and Northampton County are still in the red phase. Even in the yellow phase, restrictions do not make it feasible to get the pools opened up,” Donchez said.


  Bethlehem hires a seasonal staff of 77 to man its pools. If they are closed for the summer, it saves the city $128,000.


  In addition to the pools being closed, the city’s Music in the Parks series and Movies in the Parks will be cancelled for the summer. Sand Island courts will remain closed. The skateplaza, dog park, basketball courts, pavilion rentals, Charles Brown Ice House and Illick’s Mill will remain closed until further notice.

“Outside of Aidan there’s going to be very little varsity experience on the floor and a very young group. But, certainly a group that’s got a lot of depth and composure,” said Calcaterra. “At times it’s going to show a lack of experience, but you keep fighting through that.”
 Those with questions about what RSN may look like with Calcaterra directing players rather than the broadcast come game nights can rest assured that there’s a plan in place to make sure everyone wins.
 Rogers Coats, who handles the play by play announcing for the Ramblers football team, will take over more directing duties for the Boyne City basketball Friday nigh broadcasts and Calcaterra will still have a hand in preparation.
 “There were a couple big pieces to the puzzle that had to fall in line for me to be able to do this,” said Calcaterra. “RSN going away isn’t really an option. So we had to figure out a way to keep that going if I took over. That was a huge component to make sure that we have a system in place that it continues and continues at the level that it’s been.”
 Calcaterra also knows that the Rambler Sports Network’s success goes hand-in- hand with putting out a good product people want to watch. So, in a way, he’s just taken on more directing duties.
 “If the show isn’t up to par, all the rest of the stuff crumbles around it,” he said. “There’s an obligation to the community, obligation to myself, to the broadcast side of it and obligation to the families in the program coming up. It’s a huge show in Boyne City and we want to keep that going.”
 For hoops and highlights alike, Calcaterra is likely just the man to keep the good times going in Boyne City.

More than 4.7 million people worldwide have tested positive for the virus and over 318,000 deaths have been recorded, including about 90,000 in the U.S. and over 160,000 in Europe, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

“With regards to gaining drugs warrants and forcing entry, every case is different and in this instance it was necessary to execute a drugs warrant at the address as officers had received intelligence to suggest that the premises was being used for activity involving class A drugs.


  “In order to obtain a warrant of this nature officers are required to submit an application to the magistrates’ court.


  “The magistrate will only grant the warrant if they believe that the police have reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence has been committed, and that the premises needs to be searched as it may contain evidence that will be of benefit or important to a trial.

The New York State Board of Elections effectively canceled the presidential primary last month when the two Democratic commissioners on the panel voted to strip off the ballot every candidate who wasn't actively campaigning for president. That left former Vice President Joe Biden as the only contender on the ballot. The move would have effectively given all 274 delegates at stake in the state's Democratic presidential primary to Biden, since he would be the only candidate remaining on the ballot. The action came a day after Sanders had urged the board to let his name remain on the ballot.

The simplest answer that we can give you right now is that this show comes from a different studio than either of those already- renewed series.

One consequence of COVID-19 was to increase the price of marijuana where it is illegal. France reported that the street price of marijuana doubled in the first few weeks of lockdown. In Spain, the prices tripled, _El Pais_ reported. Belgium, the United Kingdom and other first-world nations report a similar phenomenon; even when the price of most drugs decreased because of coronavirus, the price of cannabis went against the grain and raised. The UNODC attributes this to the increase in demand for cannabis.

BARI - Questa mattina i consiglieri di Fratelli d'Italia Erio Congedo, Giannicola De Leonardis, Luigi Manca, Renato Perrini, Francesco Ventola e Ignazio Zullo hanno inviato via pec una lettera al presidente Mario Loizzo per il rispetto delle loro prerogative di rappresentanti eletti dal popolo, e dell'istituzione nel suo complesso, per ottenere delle risposte ai numerosi interrogativi sollevati da almeno due mesi, senza ottenere alcun riscontro. "Nonostante si tratti di una vicenda dall'enorme portata per la comunità, e sulla quale va garantita la massima trasparenza e il dovuto rigore - dichiarano i consiglieri FdI -, l'acquisto di mascherine e Dispositivi di Protezione Individuali dalla Cina, dopo lo show ad uso e consumo dei media all'arrivo in aeroporto, è stato blindato nel più fitto mistero, e a nulla sono valse le numerose sollecitazioni in merito a troppi aspetti che vanno invece chiariti, per rispetto degli operatori sanitari, dei cittadini, dei malati e dei morti di Covid-19 nella nostra regione, e dei contribuenti pugliesi.

Republican defense hawks would almost certainly cry foul if Democrats attempted to cut the defense budget. Trump and congressional leaders locked in a $741 billion topline for fiscal 2021 as part of two-year deal on spending. GOP lawmakers have argued that level still doesn't adequately address the needs of the military as it pivots from the Middle East toward competition with China and Russia.
