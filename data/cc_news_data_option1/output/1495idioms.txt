New U.S. unemployment figures loomed Thursday. With many factories shut down, American industrial output shriveled in March, registering its biggest decline since the nation demobilized in 1946 at the end of World War II. Retail sales fell by an unprecedented 8.7%, with April expected to be far worse.
 In France, Amazon suspended operations after a court ruled it wasn’t doing enough to protect its workers in the country. The online retailer, which has six warehouses in France, said it would evaluate the court decision.
 In Britain, a government survey found that a quarter of companies has suspended business. Cargo traffic at Europe's massive port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands sank 9.3% in the first quarter from the same period a year ago and its CEO warned of worse to come.
 The World Health Organization's European chief said optimism that the spread of the virus was declining in Italy, Spain and France was tempered by the knowledge that it was rising or sustained at a high level in Britain, Russia and Turkey.
 “The storm clouds of this pandemic still hang heavily over the European region,” Dr. Hans Kluge said.
 The International Monetary Fund says fallout from what it calls the “Great Lockdown” will be the most devastating since the Great Depression in the 1930s.
 That has made leaders all the more anxious to send people back to work and school and to rebuild economies devastated by the pandemic that has infected more than 2 million people and claimed more than 137,000 lives, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

You may recall personal computer sales struggled to muster measurable growth last year even with the looming end of support for Windows 7. Kitagawa expressed concern with Gartner's 2019 PC market analysis that -- without any major PC performance innovations -- older computers now running Windows 10 have several more years of useful life ahead. Any new computer purchases coming out of the coronavirus slowdown may be the proverbial "last hurrah" for what was a relatively feeble PC sales/upgrade cycle.                                                                                                                                                                                          *[ON]: Ontario

Barca will be eyeing seventh consecutive victory in all competitions when they face their city rivals this weekend.
 And that is the only thing on Luis Enrique's mind despite having a mouth- watering UEFA Champions League game against PSG to come three days later.
 The Catalan giants and the French champions are already assured of a place in the last 16, but top spot will be up for grabs at Camp Nou.
 But coach Luis Enrique will not rest players ahead of that encounter when his side face Espanyol.
 "There is nothing we can do about PSG at the moment, our focus is on tomorrow and putting the strongest XI out," he said. "That is the only game that will influence my selection.
 "It is not the kick-off time I would have liked, the more days to prepare for the game the better, but television pays the bills."
 Luis Enrique expects a tough clash with their neighbours in La Liga, despite Barca already holding a 17-point advantage ahead of the match.
 "They are always nice games, games with a lot of intensity," he added. "It is an important and special game, the emotion is different in derby games but our objective is the same as every game.
 "I've seen them play lots of different ways this season, experimenting with systems, with lots of options,
 "It will be a good game, I think they will play defensively and on the counter attack, that is what they do best."

Stephane Moulin's side, who finished ninth in the league last season, went agonisingly close to making the final last year but were narrowly beaten 3-2 by losing finalists Rennes.
 They head to fifth tier outfit Dinan Lehon hoping to produce a similar performance to the display that saw them wallop Argentre Du-Plessis 10-0 in the previous round.
 Ajaccio travel to face fellow Corsican side Borgo hoping to avoid the same fate of their city rivals Gazelec Ajaccio, who were dumped out in the last round.
 Olivier Pantalon's side went through in round seven with an uninspiring 1-0 win over Olympique Ales last month after going down to 10 men early on and they will fancy their chances of progressing again.
 Ajaccio face a Borgo team who ply their trade in the fifth tier and will be eyeing a shock win at a Stade Paul-Antoniotti stadium which has a capacity of only 1,300.
 Like Ajaccio, Sochaux also suffered relegation from Ligue 1 at the end of last season and they face three-time Coupe de France winners RC Strasbourg.
 There are many teams already in the competition who have graced Ligue 1 in the not-too-distance past, including four-time winners Auxerre, who visit Sarreguemines.

That's easier for some than for others. The coronavirus has put politics on the back burner for many. Rallies and fundraisers - where potential vice presidential candidates might essentially audition for the position - are barely happening. Meanwhile, governors in the running might seem to have an advantage as their official day job becomes a public test of their ability to handle a crisis in the spotlight.

Saudi Arabia is leading a military coalition supporting the Yemeni government against the Iran-backed Huthi rebels and has also been involved in the fight against Al-Qaeda.
 Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which is active in Yemen, is considered by the United States as the radical group's most dangerous branch.
 Observers also point at burbling resentment among arch-conservatives in the kingdom over the government's multi-billion dollar entertainment push as it seeks to diversify its economy away from oil.
 De facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has pursued sweeping social reforms to modernise the kingdom, lifting decades-long bans on cinemas and women drivers while allowing gender-mixed concerts and sporting extravaganzas.
 Saudi Arabia executed at least 187 people on death row in 2019, according to a tally based on official data, the highest since 1995 when 195 people were executed.
 Twelve people have been executed so far this year, according to official data.

The global solar furnace market is envisaged to leverage the opportunity created with the growing need to use solar energy as a cost-effective alternative to fossil fuel, owing to its increasing prices. The international market is also anticipated to take advantage of the security concerns associated with the usage of energy. The solar furnace or concentrator technology is an effective means of using solar energy. It finds usage in small scale applications such as cooking without the consumption of firewood as well as large scale applications such as generating electricity by heating a gas. Solar furnace is a more advanced version compared to a traditional furnace. It consists of a primary solar collection system and static parabolic concentrator.                                                                                                                                                                  *[ON]: Ontario

Servants dutifully attended to the sick in wealthy households, often succumbing to the illness themselves.

That said, the lack of NFC and Motorola's infamous history with software updates could be reason to think twice before picking it up.

Nearly 700 sailors assigned to the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle's naval group have tested positive for the coronavirus, the armed forces ministry said on Wednesday.
 The ministry said 1,767 mariners, nearly all from the Charles de Gaulle itself, had been tested and results showed at least 668 to be infected with the new coronavirus. Results are still not in from a third of the tests.
 "Thirty one personnel are today in hospital," it said in a statement. "More tests are being carried out."
 The carrier, which had most recently been taking part in exercises with northern European navies in the Baltic Sea, arrived home in Toulon two weeks earlier than expected after about 40 crew members showed signs of COVID-19 symptoms.
 Sick crew members had been placed under strict medical observation on board the nuclear-powered carrier and a team equipped to carry out the first tests airlifted to the vessel.
 Crew from the Charles de Gaulle and the frigate Chevalier Paul were now in confinement within their naval base, while the pilots of the carrier's warplanes and helicopters were also in quarantine.
 The navy chief had ordered an investigation, the ministry said.
 The Charles de Gaulle set sail for the eastern Mediterranean on January 21 to support French military operations against Islamist militants in Iraq and Syria, before deploying to the Atlantic and then the Baltic.

The worldwide death toll from the novel coronavirus pandemic rose to 137,500 on Thursday, according to a tally compiled by AFP at 1100 GMT from official sources. More than 2,083,820 declared cases have been registered in 193 countries and territories since the epidemic first emerged in China in December.
 Of these cases, at least 450,500 are now considered recovered. The tallies, using data collected by AFP from national authorities and information from the World Health Organization (WHO), probably reflect only a fraction of the actual number of infections. Many countries are testing only the most serious cases.
 In the United States, now the epicentre of the pandemic, the death toll stood at 30,985 with 639,664 infections. At least 50,107 patients have recovered. Italy is the next most-affected country with 21,645 deaths from 165,155 infections.
 It is followed by Spain with 19,130 fatalities from 182,816 confirmed infections, France with 17,167 deaths and 147,863 infections and Britain with 12,868 deaths from 98,476 cases. China \-- excluding Hong Kong and Macau \-- has to date declared 3,342 deaths and 82,341 cases with 77,892 recoveries.
 Europe has listed 1,047,303 cases and 90,181 deaths to date, the US and Canada together have 667,870 cases with 32,039 deaths, Asia 151,423 cases with 5,369 deaths, the Middle East 112,377 cases with 5.253 deaths, Latin America and the Caribbean 79,862 cases with 3,669 deaths, Africa 17,293 cases with 910 deaths and Oceania 7,694 cases with 79 deaths..

With passenger flights being suspended till May 3, full service carrier Vistara is considering diversifying its revenue stream by utilising aircraft to haul cargo, a senior company official said. Accordingly, the airline which has 42 aircraft is considering various opportunities and it might soon commence cargo flights after securing business at viable levels. Currently, commercial domestic and international flights are banned since March 25, 2020, barring cargo operations. The provision mandated under the national lockdown has dealt a heavy blow to the already struggling aviation industry. Furthermore, the lockdown which has been deemed necessary to curb the spread of COVID-19, has dealt a heavy blow to commerce, leading to a temporary closure of shopping malls, dine-in restaurants, shutting down of factories and deserted marketplaces. We are looking into various opportunities and cargo flights are definitely something we are considering subject to securing business at viable levels, Vistaras Chief Commercial Officer Vinod Kannan told IANS.  We are keen to support all businesses that bring essentials to people in these tough times. Were exploring all viable possibilities at the moment. In terms of fixed cost savings during the extended lockdown period, the airline has instituted a compulsory no-pay leave for a section of its employees. These leaves without pay range from one to three days, depending on employment grades.  As per the plan, senior-most employees will have to take three days of compulsory no-pay leave. The extension of lockdown and suspension of our services till May 3 further impacts our cash flow significantly. As part of a number of steps we are taking to conserve cash and save costs, we had to make the difficult decision of further reducing our staff costs with the objective of preserving jobs, a Vistara spokesperson was quoted as saying in an earlier statement. For the period between April 15 and April 30, about 30 per cent of Vistaras workforce will take compulsory no-pay leave of one to three days, depending on their employment grades (three days for senior-most employees). This decision does not impact the remainder 70 per cent of Vistara staff.  Besides, the airline is working on finalising specific procedures that would be deployed as and when the operations start. Broadly, some important, stringent preventive measures includes temporary fleet-wide removal of all reading material from seatback pockets, Kannan said. Any passenger showing symptoms of fever or respiratory illness will undergo a precautionary check-up with the Airport Medical Support Team. The Tata Group- Singapore Airlines JV airline had commenced commercial operations in 2015 and has since flown more than 20 million passengers. (Rohit Vaid can be contacted at rohit.v@ians.in)

There are a lot of things going on here. First of all, why was this a $1,000 question? If something this easy is worth $1,000, I can't even imagine the answer to the $200 clue. Plus, in 1957, the Brooklyn Dodgers moved to Los Angeles -- you know, where USC is located. This is basic L.A. knowledge! And the fact that Ying's flub happened on April 15, also known as the official "Jackie Robinson Day," is really the icing on the cake.

The state is planning to roll out fast track testing for all health care workers in the coming days, she said.
 Raimondo Wednesday also announced that the state has contracted with the Wyndham Hotel in Warwick, which will reserve just over 200 beds for those people who are homeless or housing insecure and need to quarantine.
 “We’ve served about 50 people already at that location,” she said.
 The governor also announced a new dash board data tracker that will be shown at her daily press briefings and updated daily with case information and data, including new cases, number of fatalities and total daily tests.
 “From day one I have said that I want to be transparent and fact-based,” Raimondo said. “I want to give you, the people of Rhode Island, the facts that you need and deserve to live your lives safely and so this is just another step in our effort to make the information more accessible and more granular for every body to see.”
 Raimondo also thanked Rhode Islanders for their patience so far during the crisis.
 “This is getting tough. Staying at home, not being in school and work is getting really old for all of us,” she said. “I’m asking you to hang in there with me just a little bit longer. It’s still a critical time in these next couple of weeks. Know that I am right there with you and that this is getting harder, not easier. But we can do it. If we hang tough together we’ll all be safer and better for it.”

The visitors halted a run of four straight Premier League defeats with a goalless draw at the KC Stadium, but it could have been much better had Dorrans put away his 10th-minute penalty after Victor Anichebe was hauled down by Jake Livermore.                                                                                                          Instead, Allan McGregor saved his fellow Scot's poor spot-kick and neither side created any real chances of note after that.                                                                                                          Irvine was pleased to have stopped a losing run, but left cursing that vital moment.                                                                                                          "It is does stop the run of the results and that's good, that's a real positive without a doubt," Irvine told the BBC.                                                                                                          "But we could have won the game. Obviously, the penalty is a key moment.                                                                                                          "Goals change games and had we scored then who knows what might have been.                                                                                                          "We didn't have enough of a threat in front of goal and like I say the penalty, had we scored it, might have changed things."                                                                                                          That being said, Irvine was impressed by the manner in which his struggling squad reacted to that set-back.                                                                                                          He believes it could have proved the catalyst for the hosts to go on and seize the initiative, but his side did not allow that to happen.                                                                                                          "We started the game very well. I was worried we might not be able to deal with the penalty miss mentally because it gave Hull a boost, it gave the crowd a boost as well, but we coped with that and I was really pleased about it," he added.                                                                                                          "It was certainly a tense game, and why wouldn't it be with the current positions of both sides?                                                                                                          "It's a tough place to play, it’s tough when people are scrapping and trying to just get something to give them a boost.                                                                                                          "The effort of the players and the way they went about things, I couldn’t fault at all. I don't think anybody could ever question the effort they put in."                                                                                                                                                                  *[ON]: Ontario

Meanwhile, the middle class or poor, forced to stay at home, "caught the plague by the thousand right there in their own neighborhood, day after day" and swiftly passed away. Servants dutifully attended to the sick in wealthy households, often succumbing to the illness themselves. Many, unable to leave Florence and convinced of their imminent death, decided to simply drink and party away their final days in nihilistic reveries, while in rural areas, laborers died "like brute beasts rather than human beings; night and day, with never a doctor to attend them."                                                                                                                                                                                                      *[ON]: Ontario

West Ham are flying high in the Premier League, sitting fourth in the table after upstaging 10-man Swansea City 3-1 at Upton Park on Sunday.
 Towering English striker Carroll was on target twice as West Ham won their third consecutive league match to move within nine points of leaders Chelsea.
 While many believe West Ham will drop off the pace over the Christmas period, Carroll said he believes the London club can mount a sensational title challenge and go all the way.
 "I think there is no limit, we can go all the way to the top," the 25-year-old said.
 "We have a great squad and I can't say we are going to give up, now we are in the top four. We have got a great team and we can go all the way.
 "I think with the team we have got and the manager [Sam Allardyce], the way he is playing and coaching everyone, it is fantastic and I don't think we will be giving up at all."

Germany and Bayern Munich defender Niklas Suele admits having mixed feelings about the possible return of German league football next month amid the coronavirus pandemic. Next Thursday, the German Football League (DFL) plans to meet via video conference with the 36 clubs in the first two leagues to discuss whether matches can resume in early May.
 As public events in Germany are banned until August 31, football matches before that date could only be played in near-empty stadiums with fans locked out. If the German authorities give the green light, the Bundesliga could be the first top European league to resume since German league matches were halted on March 13.
 Most of the 18 top flight clubs in Germany returned to training last week, albeit with social distancing being observed even on the pitch. The DFL is determined to finish the season by June 30 to ensure its clubs do not lose out on crucial TV rights revenue, but Suele is sceptical.
 "There are many more important things than football at the moment," the 24-year-old told AFP subsidiary SID. "Of course I want to get fit and play again, but the important thing is that my family is well, that everyone is healthy.
 "As football professionals, we are blessed when we see how many companies have to close or how hard some families are hit. That's bad. "Whether we play sooner or later is irrelevant." However, Suele admits he would be "very happy if we could start again. Maybe it would also be a little distraction for many fans".
 Suele has returned to training after a serious knee injury last October, and acknowledges that his comeback will probably be in front of empty terraces. "Of course, during rehab I imagined how nice it would be to run out at the sold-out Allianz Arena (Bayern's home ground) again," he said.
 "Unfortunately, that's going to be a thing of the past, but I'd still be happy to be able to play with my team again." In Germany, games played behind locked doors are called "ghost games" and Suele insists they are a better option than no matches at all. "From my point of view, there's no player anyway who'd rather not play at all than have ghost games," he added.
 Just over 3,500 people have so far died due to the coronavirus in Germany. AFP SSC SSC.

We may see the rally coming to a halt if some vaccine is invented for coronavirus. Also, there is a possibility that the central banks start selling their gold reserves to fund their economic stimulus packages.

The CRC was a complicated reporting framework that bore no resemblance to other reporting standards and excluded certain business energy supplies. It also aimed to fulfil a dual role of both a carbon reporting and taxation framework, with a cost incurred based on calculated CO2 emissions. SECR, in contrast, is not a tax and requires reports to disclose methodologies used. It also represents business energy more fully by including transport and covers the Kyoto Protocol basket of six GHGs with CO2e rather than CO2 only.                                                                                                                                                                                                      *[ON]: Ontario

As the coronavirus pandemic has brought various sectors to a grinding halt, students preparing for various entrance examinations are switching to online coaching portals which have remained immune to the nationwide lockdown. While all exams scheduled in the months of April and May have been postponed indefinitely by the National Testing Agency, coaching institutes in cities across India are shut.
 Irrespective of the fees that many had paid to the centres before the lockdown came in force, students are struggling to keep up with their studies and have no choice but to shift to online classes so as to not waste crucial time. Pranav Thanki, a student from Porbandar in Gujarat, had, in January, shifted 200 km away to Surat to pursue medical coaching. However, the coaching centres closed down in March.
 "I don't think it is just me who is benefitting from online coaching… it has emerged as a saviour for many at the right time. During such trying times, online coaching for medical and engineering exams is the need of the hour," Thanki told PTI from Porbandar. Several other students from different parts of the country echoed the same sentiment.
 "My simple question is why do many of the conventional coaching centres do not have online teaching system. This lockdown hampered our education but online coaching option has come to our rescue," Sanchita Rai from Lucknow told PTI. Educational experts from both conventional and online coaching platforms said a paradigm shift from brick and mortar classrooms to virtual ones was in the offing much before the COVID-19 outbreak but the subsequent lockdown is expected to speed up the switchover. "While it seems like online (learning) is the only option for at least the next 3-4 months, a lot of these students would have to come to terms with the changed reality," Kapil Gupta, the founder and CEO of NEETprep, a leading pan India online coaching centre, told PTI.
 According to him once a student is enrolled in an online coaching centre such as NEETprep, he/she will never miss face-to-face classroom coaching. "A lot of new adopters, especially those who have to switch from classroom coaching to online coaching, would have to design their days to ensure self-discipline and consistency of studies," he said.
 "In this 21-day lockdown, this, ironically, might actually not be too difficult considering there is no outside activity like going out for a movie or with friends. And who knows, how many of these students who switch now will ever go back to classroom coaching," he added. Col Anil Dhall, a well-known cardiologist and currently serving as the Professor and head of the Department of Cardiology at Janakpuri Superspecialty Hospital and a close observer of medical education dynamics, said gradually all the conventional coaching centres will have to offer online coaching if they want to survive.
 "Situations like lockdown are boosters to a paradigm shift. Time saving, extensive content, and wider availability of faculty drives students towards online coaching. Instead of saying that conventional coaching will die, the situation will push them to transform into online coaching providers, where a lockdown kind of a thing won't impact the students," Dhall told PTI. Akhand Swaroop Pandit, CEO and co-founder of Catalyst Group, an online learning platform, believes like most industry segments needing physical infrastructure and presence, lockdown has had a negative effect on conventional offline coaching centres and this is where online course providers will gain.
 "Conventional coaching is suffering as they have to bear direct costs such as rentals with no means to earn revenue with admissions being closed. On the other hand, students are preferring online classes during lockdown which they can attend as per their convenience," he told PTI. "Subscription rates have seen a spike. This incident would definitely encourage the industry to strengthen the online coaching ecosystem for future, leading to greater penetration of our services," he added.
 Narendra Shyamsukha, founder and chairman of ICA Edu Skills, said most conventional coaching institutes have also come up with e-learning options and are engaging their students with online study materials, assignments and webinars. Meanwhile, the Maharashtra Class Owners Association (MCOA) that has nearly 1 lakh tutorials under its ambit, has urged the government to grant certain relaxations in taxes and other charges over the next few days as the lockdown has affected thee attendance and revenue of coaching classes in the state.

Amazon’s protocols also protect it from paying out the proceeds it collects from buyers to bad actors. For newly registered sellers, the company said it retains payments for a week after the expected delivery date to cover returns, refunds or other issues.
 Those protections safeguard Amazon, but they may be cold comfort for consumers who find products to be of poor quality or different from what was advertised. As with Franssen, some may ask the seller for a refund. But there still could be room for the merchant to profit. After a back-and-forth with the seller, Franssen was given a refund of $8.82 — less than a third of what she paid.

While briskly developing economies such as India, Indonesia, China, and Vietnam reflect lucrative potential to instrument a strong base for the growth of savory flavor ingredients market, it is more likely that leading manufacturers of specialty food ingredients would invest in business expansion & R&D across these regional territories. In addition, escalating favor for Asia’s authentic flavors across European and American countries points to the is compelling specialty flavor brands such as Nestle S.A. to focus on a host of Asian flavors as a part of regional and exotic flavor promotions. Similarly, seafood and sushi constitute the most popular preferences in Japanese savory flavor ingredients market, whereas China’s savory flavor ingredients market has been witnessing growing traction for meat-based flavors.

He was able to access the "Get My Payment" site, only to learn that his money had been deposited in an account that he didn't recognize. He checked the numbers on his current and older bank accounts, but they didn't match. His mother, meanwhile, received the "Payment status not available" message.
 "I need it for bills. I've got to pay for my house, insurance, food and my mom now because she doesn't have any money," Brooks said.

Electronic gear selectors are getting more and more popular, rapidly replacing traditional mechanical shifters. Naturally, some auto-makers' implementations of tech is this easy to use and well thought out, but other manufacturers have completely missed the mark.
 It seems like every new or redesigned vehicle these days features an electronic gear selector, where there's no mechanical linkage between the shifter and transmission. There are countless benefits to going this route, from increasing interior storage space to lighter weight to enabling some seriously innovative new features -- particularly certain advanced driver- assist systems.
 For the most part, shift-by-wire is a great idea, even if sometimes automakers' implementations can take time to get used to (or worse, remain super annoying). I'd argue that certain automakers haven't instituted this technology properly, however, and that this can cause more problems than it solves. Check out the accompanying video where I sound off on electronic shifters. Do you agree with my take on this topic, or am I just full of hot air?

Schweinsteiger - appointed Germany captain after the international retirement of club team-mate Philipp Lahm - made his first start since the victorious World Cup final on Wednesday as Bayern cruised past CSKA Moscow 3-0 in the UEFA Champions League.
 The midfielder is working towards full fitness and acknowledges he is still a bit off the pace.
 But more starts should do the trick for Schweinsteiger and a run-out against red-hot Bundesliga rivals Augsburg is just what the 30-year-old is after.
 "It was great [to return] in front of the home fans," Schweinsteiger said after the Champions League success.
 "When the team are playing well that obviously makes things easier for me.
 "It wasn't easy being out injured, so I'm just happy to be back in the fold.
 "I can tell I'm still lacking a few per cent but that will come with match practice.
 "We'll always play good football at the highest level because we have so much quality in our team, and I'm sure we'll improve on the few mistakes we're making currently too."
 Bayern can ill-afford errors against an Augsburg side that have defied the critics to surge to third in the table.
 And Markus Weinzierl's men famously ended Bayern's 53-game unbeaten run in the Bundesliga earlier this year, winning 1-0 thanks to Sascha Molders' first-half strike in April.
 Pep Guardiola has led Bayern to an outstanding start to the season in response, though, with 11 wins from 14 matches helping them build a seven- point lead at the top.
 They have scored 33 goals - five more than any other side in the Bundesliga - and conceded a mere three, making it a tough ask for Augsburg, who, in their fourth season in Germany's top tier, are in the highest position of their 107-year history.
 But the hosts will be buoyed by a four-match winning run, and they have triumphed in five of their six home games this season.
 Augsburg - who are yet to register a draw in 14 games this term - have defender Paul Verhaegh as their leading scorer with five.
 Without a prolific striker, midfielder Tobias Werner has chipped in with four goals and Augsburg's relatively even spread of contributors makes them tricky to stop.
 Guardiola has no new injury worries, with the likes of Lahm (ankle), David Alaba, Thiago Alcantara and Javi Martinez (all knee) all sidelined.
 And despite Bayern's loss to Augsburg last term, they do have a good record against their Bavarian neighbours - having won the other seven clashes between the two sides.

But how would you go about adding a secondary display to a portable device that's already bulky enough?                                                                                                                                                                                          *[ON]: Ontario

The Belgian champions went undefeated across their final three matches in Group D, coming from three goals down to draw 3-3 at Arsenal and defeating Galatasaray 2-0, before clinching a late 1-1 draw away to Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday.
 After Ciro Immobile gave Dortmund the lead just before the hour-mark with a sharply-taken goal, Aleksandar Mitrovic clinched a share of the points for the visitors in the 84th minute, heading Anthony Vanden Borre's cross home at the back post.
 Anderlecht sit third in the Belgian Pro League after 18 rounds, having slipped behind Club Brugge and Kortrijk over the past three weeks, but Hasi is confident his team can win silverware this season if they maintain their Champions League form in other competitions.
 "Tonight I expected my lads to make up [for poor league performances] and that's what they did," Hasi said, according to _uefa.com_.
 "It was important to make amends but now we have to confirm this good performance against less glamorous opposition.
 "If we continue like this, we can still go places this season."
 Anderlecht have lost on the road at mid-table clubs Mouscron-Peruwelz and Sporting Charleroi in their past three league fixtures, while they were held to a 2-2 draw at home by rivals Club Brugge.
 But with a Belgian Cup quarter-final first leg coming up next week, plus the UEFA Europa League, which Anderlecht qualified for after finishing third in Group D of the Champions League, Hasi is excited about what could happen in 2014-15.
 "This Champions League campaign has been extraordinarily positive, I want to congratulate my players on it," the Albanian said.
 "It has showcased our football, something we last had at Anderlecht in 2000-01. We must not forget that we have one of the youngest sides in the Champions League and at times we were able to play refreshing attacking football.
 "Now we wait to see who the draw pits us against in the UEFA Europa League but first we will focus on the Belgian Pro League."

Without fanfare but with great efficiency, beloved Nordic hot-springs destination Iceland and its government, led by Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir, have been providing Europe and the world with a textbook example of how to sail the shoals of the global pandemic with an array of less restrictive, but very much mandated, social distancing and a maximum of testing, including that of the asymptomatic population. Elementary schools and kindergartens are open in a limited way and have remained so throughout, a boon to working parents and to the larger economy. Shops small and large are open, as are the airports for travelers in transit and returning Icelanders alike. The 14-day quarantine for returning Icelanders and foreign nationals who live in-country is, as everywhere in Europe, in effect.

The mayor wrote a lengthy post on Facebook which says in part it "is absolutely heartbreaking, and deflating, to have State Representative Julie Alexander encouraging exactly the opposite of what we are told by public health professionals and healthcare leaders."      Mayor Derek Dobies reminded residents "we are not out of the woods yet," and pleaded for everyone to "honor those on the front lines by practicing social distancing. Do your part to stay home, stay safe, and save lives."

Postponing the Tokyo 2020 Olympics will provide a welcome boost to the coronavirus-hit Japanese economy next year, a senior International Olympic Committee (IOC) official claimed on Thursday. With tens of thousands dying around the world from the coronavirus, the IOC and Japan last month took the historic decision to delay the Olympics by one year, with an Opening Ceremony planned for July 23, 2021.
 The pandemic has devastated the global economy as economists predict a second Great Depression, with USD 9 trillion wiped out and tens of millions of jobs lost. Japan, the world's third-largest economy, is no exception, but IOC official John Coates told reporters holding the Games in 2021 could be a "very positive opportunity for an economic stimulus" that could "kickstart the economy again." "I think there will be a lot of countries and cities around the world wishing for a similar opportunity," he said.
 Economists at SMBC Nikko Securities have estimated postponing the Games would reduce Japan's GDP this year by some USD 6 billion -- to be recouped next year if the Olympics actually take place. Coates claimed Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe "may well have had in mind that your country may be in a recession then and this would be an opportunity for a great economic stimulus".
 In terms of the budget, organisers have already recognised there will be "massive" additional costs from the USD 12.6 billion the Games were supposed to cost -- shared between the Japanese government, Tokyo 2020 and the host city. Coates said they would use the postponement to look at ways of reducing those additional costs. Organisers would look at "what are the must-haves and what are the nice-to-haves," he pledged.
 Moving the world's biggest sporting event is an unprecedented challenge that touches on every aspect of the organisation -- from hotels to venues and volunteers. Organisers have stressed they are working towards a new Opening Ceremony on July 23, 2021 but Tokyo 2020 CEO Toshiro Muto has admitted uncertainty over the global impact of coronavirus.
 There is "no Plan B," Tokyo 2020 spokesman Masa Takaya told reporters at an online briefing on Tuesday. Coates said by choosing to move the Games by a whole year -- rather than hold them in the Spring -- they had given themselves "as much time as possible," stressing that athletes' health would be the guiding principle.

The Muslim community has made it a habit of indulging in victimhood politics, all the while as Islamic terrorists continue to pose the greatest threat to peace and stability. While the crimes of Islamic terrorists elicits the popular 'Not True Muslims', other religious communities are continuously portrayed in poor light and demonized and portrayed as oppressors. Even right after an Islamic terror attack, the immediate concern does not go out to the victims themselves but potential victims of 'Islamophobic hate crimes' that somehow never takes place. The victim card has been played so often and so thick and fast that it has lost its utility. So, if Muslims could stop playing it, it would be great.

The BCCI on Thursday suspended the 2020 Indian Premier League "till further notice", a decision that was conveyed to the franchises a couple of days back and was expected after the lockdown to combat the COVID-19 pandemic was extended. PTI reported on April 14 that the eight franchises along with other stakeholders had been intimated about the indefinite postponement of the event, which was originally planned from March 29. The Board on Thursday said that given the "evolving global health concerns" and lockdown measures implemented by the government, it had no choice but to further postpone the glitzy T20 league. "...the IPL Governing Council of the BCCI has decided that the IPL 2020 Season will be suspended till further notice," said BCCI secretary Jay Shah in a statement. The pandemic has claimed over 400 lives in India and infected more than 12,000 people. Globally, the death toll has crossed 1.3 lakh.
 The IPL, which was to run till May 24 as per the original schedule, was first postponed till April 15 after the government imposed restrictions on entry of foreigners due to the surge in COVID-19 cases. The travel bar meant that no international player could compete in the tournament if it went ahead on time. With the situation still not conducive for any sporting activity and the country in the middle of a lockdown till May 3, the BCCI refrained from giving any estimate on when the event might be held.
 "The health and safety of the nation and everyone involved in our great sport remains our top priority...the IPL 2020 season will only commence when it is safe and appropriate to do so," Shah further stated. Along with the IPL, all other cricketing action is also suspended right now due to the government directive which bars any large gathering.
 BCCI was non-committal on when cricket could resume in the country and Shah maintained that India's richest sporting body is monitoring the situation and will seek guidance from the central government as well as states before taking any decision. "BCCI will continue to monitor and review the situation regarding a potential start date in close partnership with all of its stakeholders and will continue to take guidance from the Government of India, state governments and other state regulatory bodies," Shah added.
 IPL franchises have had a mixed view on holding the event this year. While Kings XI Punjab co-owner Ness Wadia has stated that sport cannot be priority at the time of a pandemic, Rajasthan Royals had suggested having the tournament behind closed doors some time this year. Players -- past and present -- have, however, been united in saying that that the tournament should go ahead at some point given the livelihoods it sustains.
 The only window which the BCCI can target for hosting the tournament is September-November. For that to happen, India will have to skip the Asia Cup in Dubai or else, Cricket Australia and the International Cricket Council will have to agree to postpone the T20 World Cup.
 The World Cup is scheduled to be held in October-November..

A Munbai court here on Thursday granted bail to a television journalist arrested for allegedly `spreading misinformation' with his report that the government was thinking of starting Jan Sadharan train services for migrants, which allegedly led to a crowd gathering in Bandra. Rahul Kulkarni, journalist with a Marathi news channel, was arrested by Mumbai Police on Wednesday, a day after several migrant workers gathered near Bandra station here demanding that they be sent back to their home towns.
 Kulkarni was produced before a magistrate in Bandra on Thursday where the police sought his custody. The court, however, refused the police's plea and remanded Kulkarni in judicial custody, following which his advocate Subodh Desai immediately filed a bail application.
 After hearing brief arguments, the court granted him bail on a surety of Rs 15,000. Ten others arrested in the case were remanded in police custody till April 19.
 The police booked Kulkarni under Indian Penal Code Sections 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 505(b) (intent to cause fear or alarm among public whereby any person may be induced to commit an offence against the state or against public tranquility), and provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act. According to police, Kulkarni allegedly gave a "false" story, saying the Railways was going to start special trains to ferry migrant workers stranded in Maharashtra back to their native states.
 The police said hundreds of migrant workers gathered at the Bandra station on Tuesday after watching the news, and they were later dispersed. Meanwhile, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut hailed court's decision to grant bail to Kulkarni.
 He said the arrest of the journalist in connection with the gathering of migrants in Bandra was unfortunate. Talking to a news channel, Raut said the government and media were both important pillars of democracy.
 "Both sides should be alert that such an incident should not happen again. I am happy journalist Rahul Kulkarni got bail. The police should find out truth into the charges on which he was arrested," the Rajya Sabha member said. Raut, who is the executive editor of Shiv Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana', said he was speaking as a journalist andnot Sena leader.
 He said the "Railways was also responsible for the problem"..

 On April 3, President Trump announced that his administration would consider reimbursing hospitals for treating uninsured COVID-19 patients.
 In other words, President Trump is looking at experimenting with a single- payer system that covers uninsured Americans for all costs related to treatment for the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
 This move has freed many Americans from the anxiety of being unable to seek treatment, yet single-payer Medicare for All is often framed as \"limiting freedom of choice\" by preventing people from having options for their health coverage.
 The truth is that single-payer Medicare for All is real freedom -- it eliminates the insurance middlemen, allowing you to see any doctors you want and the government to make direct payments to them.
 Assuming he does not take advantage of loopholes, President Trump will now be giving Americans a small taste of what a single-payer healthcare system could be like, but only those afflicted with coronavirus who do not have insurance will see this benefit. The problem?
 For uninsured people who test negative for coronavirus, they have received bills of anywhere from $1,000 to $3,000. Fears of these bills have prevented many from getting tested. Even people with insurance who have required treatment have come out with bills in excess of $30,000.
 On top of all this, 10 million Americans have filed for unemployment in the past two weeks. Even before that, 27 million Americans were uninsured and millions more live with lackluster policies that can leave their families riddled with debt. More than 65% of personal bankruptcies in the United States were medically related prior to the coronavirus.
 We have a problem. The vast majority of other countries pay half of what we do per person, provide comprehensive care to all people, and yet medical debt does not exist.
 It is time to put the politics aside and look at what makes sense. We can and must do better.
 You just want good doctors, no debt, and to keep your family healthy at all times, not just during a pandemic. We should simply cut out the insurance middlemen and their bureaucracy, end out-of-network costs and allow everyone to visit the doctors they want to. All it takes is allowing the government to make direct payments to providers for all medical conditions, including those requiring dental, hearing, eye care, and in-home care.
 This is essentially what Medicare for All would do -- and research in the esteemed Lancet Medical Journal, as well as at least 22 other studies, have shown it would cost significantly less than our current system over a 10-year period. The savings could be used to guarantee 12-weeks paid sick leave to all Americans so everyone would have the economic security to wait out this lockdown, as well as any other illness, with peace of mind.
 It is time to think big and save millions of lives every year. We can cut medical expenditures per person and end medical debt. We can end copays, deductibles, premiums, and out of pocket expenses.
 Let's pass Medicare for All and declare healthcare a human right in the United States of America.

In terms of enterprise products, Vikas Arora, VP for cloud and cognitive, software and services, IBM India and South Asia, noted that when companies cannot ensure availability of the ideal setup on the employee end, they turn to software as a service (SaaS) solutions for communication. “Customers are looking for SaaS versions of existing services like communication, security and access control beyond firewalls more than ever because they can be up and running remotely without extensive deployment efforts," said Arora.

“Every woman who comes to us is in a crisis, but the crises are always different,” Kirby said.
 They have complex PTSD as if having returned from war, she said, but it was their life.
 “One of the things I’ve learned is that the problem of sex trafficking is so huge, complex or dark, that no single person and all organization can fight it on all fronts,” Refuge for Women Texas Gulf Coast Board Chairman Curtis Swisher said.
 Refuge for Women is a Christian faith-based organization, Swisher said, but anyone can feel free to seek help, regardless of their faith.
 “We’re just here to help out, the best that we can,” he said. “We’ll be there to help, from complete care, to guided independence.”
 The Gulf Coast chapter had managed to raise enough money to purchase a large home for its base in Brazoria County, Swisher said.
 “Feb. 7 of this year, we just bought the title of the house,” Swisher said. “We started out with $600 and then over eight months of fundraising, we received $400,000, allowing us to purchase the house debt-free.”
 Refuge for Women plans to open the house in several months, as soon as it is safe to accept new residents into the program.
 “Our goal is to open a house this year,” Kirby said. “We believe that the COVID-19 virus has put us behind at least three months.”
 The organization hopes to raise enough money to have the house fully ready once the pandemic has cleared.
 “We need about $150,000 in capital, we need a flood control system and we need to hire staff,” Swisher said.
 They have a few wonderful people in mind, he said.
 Meanwhile, as help needs to remain remote in the wake of the pandemic, Unbound Houston is offering an array of resources to help those still living in fear for their lives.

Blast furnaces are large reactors used for smelting iron ore into liquid steel at temperatures ranging from 900-1300˚ Celsius and so need to run continuously. Once a blast furnace is shut down, it is both expensive and time-consuming to restart it, taking 15-20 days to stabilise operations based on the design and size. Tata Steel, India’s largest private steelmaker by capacity, has shut down one of its blast furnaces at Dhenkanal, Odisha, while the furnace at its flagship plant in Jamshedpur is running at a third of its capacity. JSW Steel has also shut its blast furnace in Dolvi, Maharashtra. The company has curtailed production of crude steel at its mother plant in Vijayanagar, Karnataka. AM/NS India has also slowed its furnaces at its plant in Hazira, Gujarat. Mint couldn’t confirm if the curtailment has begun at public sector SAIL, although industry reports indicate reduced production across the board.                                                                                                                                  	                                                                      *[ON]: Ontario

The first top-flight meeting between the two sides got off to an eventful start when Ryan Koolwijk opened the scoring for Dordrecht in the third minute.
 Ernie Brandts' men held out for more than an hour thereafter, but Koolwijk then went from hero to villain when he was penalised for handball in the Dordrecht area, giving Oussama Tannane the opportunity to convert a 72nd- minute penalty.
 Heracles, who had won their previous three matches, edge further clear of the bottom three as a result, while Dordrecht can at least take heart from claiming only their sixth point of the campaign.
 Dordrecht had fortune on their side as they claimed a surprise lead. Koolwijk burst into the area before trying his luck with a cross-shot that beat Dennis Telgenkamp with the aid of a deflection.
 Iliass Bel Hassani spurned a chance to immediately pull Heracles level and there was another setback for the hosts before the interval when captain Mark- Jan Fledderus was forced off with an injury.
 However, the hosts eventually rescued a share of the spoils through Tassane, who converted from 12 yards after Bel Hassani had kicked the ball against the arm of Koolwijk.

On April 3, President Trump announced that his administration would consider reimbursing hospitals for treating uninsured COVID-19 patients.
   
 In other words, President Trump is looking at experimenting with a single- payer system that covers uninsured Americans for all costs related to treatment for the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
   
 This move has freed many Americans from the anxiety of being unable to seek treatment, yet single-payer Medicare for All is often framed as "limiting freedom of choice" by preventing people from having options for their health coverage.
   
 The truth is that single-payer Medicare for All is real freedom -- it eliminates the insurance middlemen, allowing you to see any doctors you want and the government to make direct payments to them.
   
 Assuming he does not take advantage of loopholes, President Trump will now be giving Americans a small taste of what a single-payer healthcare system could be like, but only those afflicted with coronavirus who do not have insurance will see this benefit. The problem?
   
 For uninsured people who test negative for coronavirus, they have received bills of anywhere from $1,000 to $3,000. Fears of these bills have prevented many from getting tested. Even people with insurance who have required treatment have come out with bills in excess of $30,000.
   
 On top of all this, 10 million Americans have filed for unemployment in the past two weeks. Even before that, 27 million Americans were uninsured and millions more live with lackluster policies that can leave their families riddled with debt. More than 65% of personal bankruptcies in the United States were medically related prior to the coronavirus.
   
 We have a problem. The vast majority of other countries pay half of what we do per person, provide comprehensive care to all people, and yet medical debt does not exist.
   
 It is time to put the politics aside and look at what makes sense. We can and must do better.
   
 You just want good doctors, no debt, and to keep your family healthy at all times, not just during a pandemic. We should simply cut out the insurance middlemen and their bureaucracy, end out-of-network costs and allow everyone to visit the doctors they want to. All it takes is allowing the government to make direct payments to providers for all medical conditions, including those requiring dental, hearing, eye care, and in-home care.
   
 This is essentially what Medicare for All would do -- and research in the esteemed Lancet Medical Journal, as well as at least 22 other studies, have shown it would cost significantly less than our current system over a 10-year period. The savings could be used to guarantee 12-weeks paid sick leave to all Americans so everyone would have the economic security to wait out this lockdown, as well as any other illness, with peace of mind.

After holding Chelsea to a goalless draw last weekend, Gus Poyet's side looked tired against City, but Buckley expects a response when they return to action at Anfield.
 The defeat extended Sunderland's winless run to four matches in the Premier League, and left them two points above the drop zone.
 Buckley says they must raise their game on Saturday, and is confident they can get a result against Brendan Rodgers' side.
 "It was a massive effort last Saturday and a good point but it does take it out of you, as you saw on Wednesday night against City," he told the club's official website.
 "Hopefully we can look ahead now and have a good performance against Liverpool.
 "We don't want to dwell on bad performances and bad results so we will try and get it out of our system as soon as possible.
 "We need to find a bit of the performance from Chelsea and take it to Anfield, but I'm sure we will do a lot better than we did against City.
 "We are confident. We will take a game plan there and hopefully this time we can execute it better."

It’s noticeable even in closer scenes, though, at least if you’re toggling ray tracing on and off. It’s probably less obvious if you stick to ray traced visuals alone. This scene from Imagination Island looks _much_ better with ray tracing on—witness the realistic reflections and shadows around the boat area, and how much more vibrant the lava appears. But also look at how much of the background detail disappears, again giving this scene a bit of an empty look.
 Most scenarios aren’t that bad, though as someone who plays _Minecraft_ regularly, I felt the reduced draw distance looking out over scenes in other worlds as well, particularly the more open areas in Of Temples & Totems.

The _Keeping Up With The Kardashians_ clan are no strangers to an internet troll, but Kourtney Kardashian was not here for the Instagram user who claimed she looked pregnant in her latest post.
 Kourtney, who is mother to Mason, 10, Penelope, 7, and Reign, 5, with ex- boyfriend Scott Disick, hit back at someone who questioned whether she was having another baby.
 "You are pregnant 🤰" the follower commented, on a photo of Kourtney in her underwear with a flowing open shirt over the top. _   _
 Originally, Kourtney replied insisting she wasn't, but that it would be a "blessing" if she were to fall pregnant. But the 40-year-old has since admitted that it is offensive when followers suggest she looks pregnant during an Instagram Live.

Marseille sit top of the table after 15 games in Ligue 1, with the France international playing a large part in their rise to the summit with 11 goals – making him the division's top scorer.
 Gignac is into his fifth season with the club and has suggested he may choose to leave for a new challenge at the end of the campaign.
 However, the 28-year-old admits head coach Bielsa, who is on a rolling one- year contract at the Stade Velodrome, could convince him to sign fresh terms.
 "As a child I wanted to become a professional and play for Marseille," he told _Gazzetta dello Sport_.
 "But now I think I'll be leaving the team at the end of the season, though I want to see what Bielsa is going to do. I am looking for new, high-profile challenges.
 "I live for football, I follow all the great leagues, even the Russian and Turkish ones.
 "I will consider every proposal with the attention and the requirement transmitted to me by Bielsa's teachings."

The stress in his eyes was gone; he was relaxed and couldn't stop smiling. This was a guy who wanted a way out of the daily grind for himself and his wife. They were shocked when they realized -- thanks to a written income plan based on the couple's goals -- that they could retire.

Kaithi is one of the rare films that pops up in Kollywood once in a while which would make us awestruck. Among the movies that were released for Deepawali this year, Kaithi should not be missed if you are a true movie buff. Written and directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj, Kaithi narrates the story of a prisoner. Dilli (Karthi) is a felon, who was in prison for his murder. Though the film had nothing about the murder, it is expected and believed my maximum of audience that the film will have a second installment, which will narrate the story of how he ended up in Jail. After getting out of the prison, Dilli’s only mission was to meet his 10-year-old daughter whom he has never seen. In some minor portions of the flashback, it was revealed that his wife was killed during a horrific incident. From the beginning to the end, the screenplay would keep one glued to their seats. The film is all about the billion dollar question that will be on the minds of audience. Will Dilli meet his daughter?

Going into the final weekend Gamba, Urawa Reds and Kashima Antlers could have all claimed the title, but Gamba's goalless draw with relegated Tokushima Vortis was enough to finish top as their rivals both lost.                                                                                                                                  Having won promotion to the top flight last season, Gamba made a stuttering start to the campaign with only four wins before the mid-season break, however they have risen to the top since it restarted in July with 15 wins along the way and also won the League Cup last month.                                                                                                                                  They were unable to find a way through against Tokushima, but in the end the point was enough to see them complete the second part of a potential treble, with the Emperor Cup final against Montedio Yamagata next weekend the final piece of the jigsaw.                                                                                                                                  Urawa looked to be on course for the championship when Yomoaki Makino gave them the lead after two minutes against Nagoya Grampus, but two goals in the final 18 minutes saw them lose 2-1 and miss out on the title.                                                                                                                                  Yusuke Muta levelled for Grampus, before Kensuke Nagai struck a winner in the 89th minute to add insult to injury for a Reds side that could have won the title two weeks ago but lost to Gamba at home.                                                                                                                                  Kashima were always fighting a battle against Sagan Tosu after Yoshiki Takahashi opened the scoring six minutes in and the hosts were unable to find a way back in as they slipped to a 1-0 defeat, meaning they just held onto third, and an AFC Champions League spot.                                                                                                                                  At the bottom Tokushima and Cerezo Osaka had already been relegated, but the final place was yet to be decided with Omiya Ardija and Shimizu S-Pulse battling it out to survive.                                                                                                                                  Omiya did their best to climb out of the bottom three with a 2-0 win over Cerezo, however Shimizu's 0-0 draw with Ventforet Kofu meant they preserved their top flight status by one point.                                                                                                                                  Elsewhere, Kawasaki Frontale beat 10-man Vissel Kobe 2-1 and Sanfrecce Hiroshima recorded a 2-0 victory over Vegalta Sendai thanks to a Yojiro Takahagi double.

Forlan has six months remaining on his contract with Cerezo but it appears unlikely he will stay in Japan following his scathing comments to El Observador TV on Thursday.
 The 35-year-old striker has barely played in the J-League since Yuji Okuma - Cerezo's third coach of the 2014 season - took over on September 8 and looks ready to leave after relegation was confirmed on Saturday.
 "Nobody from [Cerezo] has spoken with me about my contract since we were relegated," Forlan said, as translated by _Football Channel Asia_.
 "I want to go to a team that wants me."
 When the 35-year-old signed with Cerezo at the start of the 2014 campaign, the Osaka-based club became instant favourites for the J-League title but after scoring six goals in his first 11 games, Forlan and his team's fortunes started to fade.
 Cerezo picked up just 16 points in 13 games before the J-League's World Cup break and during that recess, the club sacked coach Ranko Popovic.
 In came Marco Pezzaiuoli but Cerezo claimed just four draws during the German's nine-match tenure before Cerezo's former youth coach Okuma was promoted to the top job.
 Under Okuma, Cerezo have won three J-League fixtures but were sent to the second division last week when they lost 4-1 to Kashima Antlers.
 "[Japanese players] don't understand the significance of relegation because fans don't pressure them," Forlan said.
 "There's no pressure for them to win or lose.
 "It was strange to know that we had been relegated and see [my team-mates] laughing during training the next day."
 Despite hardly playing since August, Forlan is likely to finish the season as Cerezo's top scorer as he has seven goals with one match remaining - two ahead of Kenyu Sugimoto and Cacau.
 "I was frustrated because Okuma didn't allow me to help in the last three months," Forlan said.
 "He always had an excuse to keep me from playing, saying that he wanted to defend more than attack.
 "He clearly didn't bench me for poor form, because then he'd have to bench the entire team."
 Forlan, who has been linked with a move to Penarol in the Uruguayan media, believes Japanese football needs more passion if they are to take the next step.
 "[Japan] take football as a science when it's not," he said.
 "They do things without an objective. Japanese people are very naive in some aspects.
 "When Hotaru [Yamaguchi] and [Yoichiro] Kakitani said they wanted to bring the World Cup to Japan, neither of them believed it. They only said it because that's what people wanted to hear."

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has suffered a revenue loss to the tune of USD 90 million in its last media rights deal because of the freezed bilateral cricket ties with India since 2008. India have played against Pakistan only in ICC tournaments in the last few years due to the diplomatic tension between the two nations.
 A reliable source said PCB's last five-year deal, which expired this month, included two home series against India. The broadcasters who signed the contract worth 149 million dollars had a condition that the series would be held against India. "Unfortunately since Pakistan was unable to play the two home series against India as included in the agreement, Ten Sports and PTV the two broadcasters who had taken the rights deducted 90 million dollars of the total sum as per the agreement," the source said.
 The PCB also faced financial disagreements with its last broadcaster over the unscheduled home series against West Indies etc. The source said that the PCB has already started exploring the market to get good money for its international home media rights deal either short or long term.
 "The problem is that right now due to the Coronavirus pandemic the situation in the market is bad. In fact the situation for cricket broadcast rights has been poor since last December," he said. PCB Chairman, Ehsan Mani earlier this week in a podcast had said that the Board was mentally prepared to get bids which would be lower in price than what the Board anticipated.
 Mani had insisted that although the PCB had suffered losses because of absence of series against India but it can live without playing them..

Athletic Bilbao have joined Spain's leading clubs in implementing cuts to players' wages in a bid to limit the economic damage inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic. Bilbao's announcement on Wednesday night means they become the latest La Liga team to take economic precautions after the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid and Sevilla were all forced to reduce their wage bills.
 "The annual salary will drop by 17 per cent if the competition cannot resume and by 6 per cent if the season resumes behind closed doors," an Athletic Bilbao statement read. "The players of the Athletic Bilbao men's first team, under the direction of their captains and in a gesture of responsibility and great commitment, agreed to voluntarily and significantly reduce their pay due to the circumstances which may affect the end of the 2019-20 season." Before the season was halted in the middle of March due to COVID-19, Bilbao sat 10th in the table and were due to play in the final of the Copa del Rey against Basque rivals Real Sociedad, who have also announced pay cuts for their players.
 La Liga has identified three potential dates to resume the season, at the end of May, beginning of June or end of June. But any return is likely to involve fixtures being played behind closed doors for the foreseeable future. Spain has been one of the worst-hit countries by coronavirus, with the number of confirmed deaths surpassing 19,000 on Thursday. AFP BS BS

The Ivorian club overcame Al Ahly 2-1 in last week's first leg in Abidjan to put themselves in the driving seat to become the first Ivorian winners of African club football's secondary competition.
 Christian Kouame's first-half penalty was cancelled out by Al Ahly striker Trezeguet just before the hour at Stade Robert Champroux.
 But Roger Assale stepped up in the final 10 minutes to give Sewe something to defend in Egypt.
 Al Ahly have good recent memories of playing Sewe at home, though, as they beat Rigo Gervais' side in Cairo in the group stages.
 Waleed Soliman was Al Ahly's hero on that occasion, as last season's CAF Champions League winners claimed a 1-0 victory back in July.
 A repeat of that scoreline would be enough to seal more continental glory for Juan Garrido's men, thanks to Trezeguet's away goal.
 Al Ahly are sure to fancy their chances at the Cairo International Stadium al- Qahirah, too, as they have lost just two of their last 27 home fixtures in all competitions.
 However, Gervais will be hoping his team can stand tall and write their names into Ivorian footballing folklore.

Three teams are in contention to win the championship after Urawa conceded at the death to draw 1-1 at fourth-placed Sagan Tosu last week.                                                                                                                                  Urawa appeared to have one hand on the trophy when former Japan international Yuki Abe converted a 67th-minute penalty, but despite playing the remaining 27 minutes with 10 men, hosts Sagan equalised via veteran defender Teruaki Kobayashi in injury time.

But Urawa (62 points, +21) will battle until the end as they prepare to host Nagoya Grampus at Saitama Stadium 2002 on Saturday.                                                                                                                                  "It is difficult to make comments looking at our situation," Urawa coach Mihailo Petrovic said after last week's draw.

We are conceding late goals and not getting results and these last two games have really hurt us.                                                                                                                                  "It hurts to concede top spot before the last game of the season but as long as there is a possibility [of us winning the title] then we will keep battling until the very end."

You can find each of the free maps in _Minecraft_ ’s Marketplace by searching for “ray tracing.” The official worlds each list Nvidia as the creator in the store. I spent time exploring them to show some examples of _Minecraft_ ’s ray tracing in action, and to get a gauge for the technology’s performance impact. Hybrid ray tracing is strenuous; full-on path tracing hits _hard_.
 Once you’re in a ray-traced map, you can disable the technology and return to Minecraft’s default render engine on the fly by pressing the semi-colon button on your keyboard. Let’s take a look at a couple of particularly interesting on/off comparisons from Nvidia’s maps, which maximize the visual _oomph_ of ray tracing. Click on any image to view it in full size.

In a battle of the two most successful clubs in Costa Rican league history, referee Randall Poveda dished out four yellow cards to each side before Heiner Mora scored the only goal of the game in the 91st minute.
 Mora got on the end of a cross from the left wing to give Saprissa a crucial lead ahead of their semi-final second leg away to Alajuelense on Monday.
 Saprissa - the most successful club in the Costa Rican Primera Divison - are aiming for their 31st championship but will have to be at their best next week when they travel to the Estadio Alejandro Morera Soto, as Alajuelense (29 titles) finished the Torneo de Invierno top of the table.
 In the other semi-final first leg on Wednesday, Herediano triumphed 3-2 at Cartagines with both sides finishing the match with 10 players.
 Kevin Vega struck in second-half stoppage time for Cartagines to give them some hope ahead of their trip to Heredia on Sunday but the Cartago-based club will have to do without Carlos Johnson, who received his marching orders in the 80th minute.
 Just four minutes later, Herediano midfielder Francisco Calvo was also sent off.
 Herediano started brilliantly with Yendrick Ruiz and Victor Nunez scoring in the seventh and ninth minutes, while the former added the visitors' third goal with eight minutes remaining.
 Jameson Scott's penalty just past the hour mark got Cartagines on the board, before Vega's late intervention put them within a goal ahead of the second leg.

The Delhi High Court has agreed to hear a plea seeking immediate implementation of measures for safeguarding the victims of domestic violence and child abuse amidst the coronavirus lockdown in the country. The petition moved by an NGO \-- All India Council of Human Rights, Liberties and Social Justice (AICHLS) -- highlighted the increase in domestic violence incidents since the lockdown last month, now extended till May 3, and sought the court's urgent intervention in the interest of women and children.
 Advocates Mithu Jain, Arjun Syal and Vidisha Kumar, representing the NGO, said the matter was mentioned before the high court on Wednesday and they were informed that the plea for urgent hearing has been allowed. The petition, which is likely to come up for hearing on Friday, has sought certain immediate and effective measures to be adopted to help victims of domestic violence and child abuse during the lockdown.
 It said incidents of domestic violence and child abuse have gripped not only India but countries such as Australia, the UK and USA and the reports suggest that there is a horrific surge in such cases since the COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdown. The plea claimed that the helpline numbers across the country received about 92,000 calls based on domestic abuse and violence in the first 11 days of the lockdown alone and sought that nodal officers be appointed to attend to such distress calls.
 ` It further prayed for giving wide publicity to the helpline and WhatsApp numbers as well as the contact details of the concerned NGOs and government representatives who would be able to assist the victims immediately and round the clock. The NGO sought intervention of the court saying in view of this peculiar situation, access to other ordinary channels such as courts, police, protection officers, friends and relatives is remote.
 “The lockdown also is a breeding ground for child abuse as well since they are deprived of the networks that help them cope up with, like their friends, teachers, coaches, relatives who usually provide an escape from their abusive environment,” it said. The plea has arrayed Centre, Delhi government and national Commission for Women as parties.

Lionel Messi's Barcelona future is not under threat due to behind-the-scenes ructions at Camp Nou, says head coach Quique Setien.
 LaLiga's state of lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic has not prevented Barca's internal crisis from deepening over the past week.
 Six board members resigned, applying further pressure on president Josep Maria Bartomeu, with the club subsequently pledging to take legal action against former vice-president Emili Rousaud​.
 In remarks he went on to reiterate in a public statement on Tuesday, Rousaud accused unnamed figures at Barca of having their "hand in the till" – allegations of corruption the club strongly rebuffed.
 Prospective presidential candidate Victor Font launched his own scathing attack on the Bartomeu regime, claiming Barcelona were at risk of "economic bankruptcy" and that "moral decay" had set in at the club.
 Messi himself has come into conflict with Barca hierarchy over recent months, publicly attacking sporting director Eric Abidal for criticising the squad in the aftermath of Setien's predecessor Ernesto Valverde being sacked.
 The six-time Ballon d'Or winner was also displeased at the lack of protection from the board for his team-mates as wage reductions were negotiated in response to the coronavirus crisis.
 Links to Manchester City and Inter have been reprised as a result, although Setien is confident his star man and captain will remain.
 "These are normal things at big clubs," he told TV3. "Perhaps the sad thing is that these crises are transmitted to the media.
 "It would be better to work in a quieter environment but things are like that.
 "I don't think what happened has made a player like Messi rethink whether or not to [stay with] the club. I am sure he will finish his career at Camp Nou."
 With the remainder of the 2019-20 season up in the air, Setien insists he is not keen on the prospect of Barca being awarded the title on account of two- point lead over bitter rivals Real Madrid with nine games remaining.
 "I would like to be the champion by playing LaLiga, winning it on the pitch," he said.
 "I don't know what will happen if we can't finish it but I would not feel completely champion because of being in front of Real Madrid now. We were already there when I arrived."

On paper, the displays on both phones are nearly identical. With either phone, you're getting a 6.55-inch FHD+ AMOLED display with support for HDR10+ and a smooth 90Hz refresh rate. The only obvious difference is that the display on the OnePlus 8 curves around the edges, while the 7T maintains a flat surface. The curves certainly look nice, but they're more prone to accidental touch input. Where the OnePlus 8 quite literally _shines_ is in its brighter, more color-accurate panel, though neither display will leave you disappointed.

The hosts took leads through first-half goals from Marko Vejinovic and Jan- Arie van der Heijden.
 However, Jesus Corona's strike kept Twente in contention and they were given a chance to equalise from the spot as Davy Propper was dismissed for halting a fine counter-attack in the penalty area, and Hakim Ziyech netted from 12 yards.
 Though enjoying a man advantage and the momentum, Twente could not find a winner and were unable to climb into the top four - the point keeping them sixth.
 PEC Zwolle maintained their impressive home record this season, seeing off ADO Den Haag with a 3-1 success.
 Ron Jans' side prevailed in front of their own fans for the sixth time from eight games this term thanks to a Tomas Necid double and Jesper Drost's strike, with Michiel Kramer grabbing a consolation for the away team.
 Heracles continued their recent resurgence when completing a hat-trick of wins by prevailing 4-2 on the road at Utrecht.
 After starting the campaign with seven straight losses, they have now come out on top in five of their last eight matches.
 Thomas Bruns, Mark-Jan Fledderus, Wout Weghorst and Iliass Bel Hassani did the damage, with Utrecht only able to reply through Kristoffer Peterson and Gevero Markiet.
 Groningen and Herenveen drew 1-1 at Euroborg, with Michael De Leeuw putting the hosts ahead but Mark Uth levelling.

My old college shifted all their course to online courses for the spring and summer. They were in a transition to move some courses online and this pushed them to move em all. Supposedly it's working out well for them. The only down side is the company that provides housing, book sales, and food to the students might not do as well as the university. It will be interesting how things work out in the long run that's for sure.      I can see students getting a win from this as well. On campus living and eating can get expensive. This could actually save them some money if they play their cards right by staying home and doing online courses. I was a commuter the whole time I took courses, saved a ton of money back in the day and it was much easier to pay off my debts.

The International Cricket Council (ICC) is 'exploring all options available' to them to complete the World Test Championship amid the coronavirus pandemic. "We are continuing planning for ICC events as they are but given the rapidly evolving situation as a prudent and responsible measure we are also undertaking a comprehensive business contingency planning exercise," a source within ICC told ANI.
 "This includes exploring all options available to us based on a range of scenarios connected to the pandemic," the source added. The source further added that as of now, no decision has been taken.
 The coronavirus pandemic has taken a huge toll on sports all across the globe and cricket also had to bear the brunt of the deadly virus as several series have been postponed owing to COVID-19. In the ongoing World Test Championship, a total of 71 Test matches will be played across 27 series over two years. The championship began on August 1 last year when Australia faced England in Ashes.
 The top two teams will then contest in the ICC World Test Championship final in June 2021 in the UK. Currently, India hold the top spot on the World Test Championship table with 360 points followed by Australia and New Zealand with 296 and 180 points respectively.
 The second ICC World Test Championship will run from July 2021 to June 2023. (ANI)

The Swiss government has thrown a lifeline to businesses that are threatened with bankruptcy during the pandemic lockdown. Firms can delay declaring their financial difficulties to the courts, with smaller companies being given at least three months’ grace to pay off their debts.
 The measures have been announced to save firms going under with a resultant loss of jobs. Non-essential businesses have been forced to close their doors for several weeks as part of a government plan to combat the coronavirus pandemic.
 The Swiss state has provided more than CHF60 billion in the form of bridging loans, paying the wages of workers on shortened hours and cash injections into specific industries.
 But many companies are still struggling to make ends meet with their business effectively shut down. For this reason, the government introduced on Thursday further measures to ease bankruptcy proceedings.
 Companies must show they were in good health at the end of 2019, that their financial difficulties were caused by the pandemic, and that there is a reasonable chance business can be resumed when the restrictions are lifted.
 If these criteria can be met, then the normal obligation to file for insolvency can be temporarily lifted. Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will also be given an extra three months to pay off their debts – a period that could be extended to six months on application.
 However, this does not excuse companies from paying the wages of employees. The government had previously decided not to extend a general debt payment amnesty beyond April 20, fearing this would encourage firms to default on debts.

U.S. stock index futures edged higher on Thursday, as hopes President Donald Trump would ease strict stay-at-home restrictions lifted the mood even as investors braced for another staggering jobless claims figure. Trump is expected to announce "new guidelines" for re-opening the economy at a news conference on Thursday as he said data suggested the United States had passed the peak on new coronavirus infections.
 After a 27% rally from its March lows, the S&P; 500 index inched down this week and stands 18% below its record high, as first-quarter earnings began with U.S. banks preparing for a wave of future loan defaults following a halt in business activity. Economic data on Wednesday showed U.S. retail sales plunged a record 8.7% in March, while manufacturing output dropped by the most in over 74 years, signaling worse numbers to come as the lockdowns continue.
 Economists polled by Reuters expect weekly jobless claims likely topped 5 million last week, which would take total unemployment claims to an astounding 20 million in the past month. "Expectations for economic data and the current earnings season are already extremely low (but) these figures could act as a reminder that the global economy is facing a deep recession and that recovery might take longer than initially expected," said Milan Cutkovic, market analyst at AxiCorp.
 "Despite the numerous economic stimulus packages and signs of stabilization from the Covid-19 crisis, it is still too early for investors to relax." Analysts forecast earnings for S&P; 500 companies slumped 12.8% in the first quarter, with U.S. economic growth expected to have contracted at its fastest pace since World War Two.
 On Thursday, BlackRock Inc, the world's largest asset manager saw the capital it manages fall by almost $1 trillion in the quarter as investors pulled money out of its marquee funds. Medical equipment maker Abbott Laboratories Inc posted a 16% drop in quarterly profit and suspended its full-year forecast due to uncertainty caused by the virus outbreak.
 Morgan Stanley reported a 32% fall in quarterly profit as its advisory and wealth management businesses took a hit from the economic fallout of the pandemic. Its shares slipped 0.9%. At 7:47 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 4 points, or 0.02%, S&P; 500 e-minis were up 3.25 points, or 0.12% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 41.75 points, or 0.49%.
 Chipmakers Qualcomm Inc, Intel Corp, Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc were up between 1.2% and 1.6% after the world's largest contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) reported a near doubling in first-quarter net profit. Netflix Inc rose 1.9% after multiple brokerages hiked their price targets on the stock expecting higher subscriber growth during the lockdown.
 However, United Airlines Holdings Inc slipped 2.7% as the carrier said it cut its flight schedule by 90% for May and warned travel demand, now "essentially at zero shows no sign of improving in the near term", making job cuts likely.

But whether it is three months or three quarters or 3+ years, it will happen. At that point we have the potential for an inflationary episode if the Federal Reserve keeps stimulating and the government keeps running massive deficits. If they act responsibly, inflation could rise to the 2 to 3% level and hopefully not higher. If they don’t act responsibly? All bets are off.

Clearly, the most significant thing China could do to take advantage of the chaos wrought by the novel coronavirus would be to take decisive actions to try to push a claimant off one of the features where it has de facto military or administrative control. Such an action need not constitute a major new effort by China but could simply be the logical extension of current efforts. For example, Thitu Island is a feature controlled by the Philippines around which Chinese maritime militia have been patrolling for 16 months. It would be a potential candidate for a full-scale effort by China to stop Philippine movement and resupply with a view to making the Philippine position on the island untenable. Indeed, the only reason that Beijing might not make such a move is that the Philippines’ strategic orientation has been trending toward China for some time, and it may simply not want to get in the way. Another escalatory step that Beijing could consider would be to extend its maritime borders by drawing straight baselines around the Spratly Islands, thereby asserting a legal claim to even more of the waters of the South China Sea. Such a move would heighten Beijing’s legal warfare in the South China Sea and sharply increase tensions with affected claimant states, perhaps most notably Vietnam.

Ukrainian brothers Nikita and Egor Zigura work on their sculpture of a giant fingerprint as art enthusiasts look on via a live-streaming internet link and make bids for the developing work.
 The online auction is part of a new "Stay Art Home" scheme set up to raise cash for Ukraine's main children's hospital during the coronavirus lockdown. Project co-founder Ihor Krivolapov said he had seen musicians and other public figures appearing on social media around the world to raise money and spirits as the pandemic spread.
 But many artists had stayed offline, behind closed doors in their studios, he told Reuters. "We hope that our initiative will be useful ... by gathering money for charity and discovering new opportunities for artists," he added. Dozens of other artists have joined the brothers in filming themselves making paintings, sculptures and other works while receiving comments and bids from people watching online. Auctions take place every two days.
 "We can help people by doing what we normally do, without leaving the studio," Egor Zigura said. The Zigura brothers' finished work 'Imprint' ended up going for 13,500 hryvnia (around $500).
 "It is very cool when Ukrainian artists join such initiatives during such tough times. And for that reason, I decided to support them," said the winning bidder Ihor Chernysh. (Writing by Margaryta Chornokondratenko; Editing by Andrew Heavens)

In this overwhelming situation of lockdown and social distancing, artistes have been keeping up the spirits with live performances on social media and conducting online classes. Amidst all this, they have not forgotten their social responsibility. A look at some of the fundraising initiatives taken up by artistes.
 “Through a network of artistes and organisations engaged in performing art fields across Tamil Nadu, we identified people from about 20 different art forms, who are facing an economic impact,” says T.M. Krishna, who web-streamed the #ShutInConcert, to raise funds in association with the Sumanasa Foundation. He says that they have been able to support about 550 families. While mainstream or popular art forms have shifted course to a digital platform for the time being, he mentions how art performances in small towns, villages and temples have completely stopped. “There is no online audience for them, let alone market,” he exclaims. Adding that within the socio-culturally privileged art forms there are many, who live on the margins (for example, nagaswaram and thavil artistes in the Carnatic world) who do not have this online stage. “Let us focus on these people,” he says.

I do believe that a lot of the secondary verticals where the impact has happened is more short term and they want temporary relief. They want temporary suspension of discretionary spending, they want temporary discounts, certain extension of payment terms on a temporary basis so that they can tide over this crisis and in the long term or the medium term, technology is the solution for a lot of efficiency. There will be a lot of opportunities that enterprises will have coming out of this crisis. I think they are very well positioned in the medium term to be able to make the most out of those opportunities that come out.

Vocalist-activist TM Krishna on Thursday called out film personalities for tone-deaf messaging amid the coronavirus pandemic and asked them to stay quiet if they "cannot be honest about what is staring at us everyday". The Chennai- based singer, in a series of tweets, said irrespective of political leanings, people in privileged positions must either call a spade a spade or "shut up".
 "Can these filmy types please shut up and stay in their farm houses/fancy apartments," Krishna began. The 44-year-old Carnatic vocalist said these celebrities have nothing to say about thousands of migrant workers rendered jobless, homeless and hungry by the nationwide lockdown since March 25. "Not a word on the number of workers stuck in various parts of the country struggling for food and shelter. Not a word on the mess the government of India has created and the complete lack of any care. Not a word on the risks they are facing," he wrote.
 Krishna also alleged that celebrities kept mum about the government's delayed measures to fight the deadly virus. "Not a word on the fact the this government woke up late and then shut down the country overnight, letting people suffer and struggle to make sense of their lives while people clapped, banged on plates and later lit diyas." He also criticised the fraternity for promoting physical distancing, "a fancy middle-class idea" that most of India simply cannot practice as many people live in one small room.
 "Not a word on the abysmal testing levels," Krishna said. "Irrespective of your political leanings, if you just cannot be honest about what is staring at us everyday. Just shut up," he said. Krishna's remarks come a day after Bollywood superstar Salman Khan expressed anguish and disappointment at people flouting lockdown rules and pelting stones at healthcare workers as the country grapples with the pandemic.
 The "Bharat" star, who is currently at his Panvel farmhouse, on Wednesday urged everyone to abide by the guidelines laid down by the government to contain the spread of the deadly virus and praise the efforts by all those working on the frontlines. Like other cine stars, Salman too has extended support in the COVID-19 relief efforts by pledging to financially support 25,000 daily wage workers who have been badly hit by the lockdown.

“I doubt whether things will return to normal any time in the near future. I don’t think my work will restart immediately after the lockdown is lifted. No one has money to spend on anything. I am worried about my children’s future and education,” he said. When asked if government officials or any NGO has reached out to help him, he said no. “Neither did anyone come to help us nor did I try to flee the city. There is so much uncertainty [around travelling long distances on foot during the lockdown] and I did not want to get stuck in between. There are at least 100 people like me in this area.

Ramon Tribulietx's men prevailed after regulation and injury time finished scoreless, dumping out Moghreb in Rabat on Wednesday.
 Mehdi Khallati missed the decisive spot-kick for Moghreb, after team-mate and goalkeeper Mohamed El Yousfi had brought his side back in it by saving Auckland's fourth penalty kick, taken by Mario Bilen.
 El Yousfi's save on Bilen helped square the shoot-out at 3-3 after four kicks each, as Ahmed Jahouh had the first penalty of the shootout saved by Auckland custodian Tamati Williams.
 Sanni Issa put Auckland back in front at 4-3, before Khallati's kick came back off an upright to send the New Zealand club through to a last eight clash with ES Setif on Saturday.
 Earlier, Auckland started on the front foot and forced Moghreb keeper El Yousfi into a good early save low down to his left.
 But the Kiwi club failed to take advantage of their early dominance, and they were nearly punished on the 25-minute mark.
 Moghreb striker Mouhssine Iajour raced onto a throughball, but could only shoot straight at Williams after skipping away from a desperate, last-ditch Auckland challenge.
 Emiliano Tade should have given Auckland the lead before the break, but fired wide after a slick move from the OFC Champions League winners.
 Moghreb boss Abdelaziz El Amri introduced Zaid Krouch at the interval in an attempt to increase his team's attacking potency, but it was Auckland who - once again - began the half strongest.
 As in the first period, though, there was a distinct lack of quality in the final third, but Ryan De Vries could have done better when shooting into the side-netting from inside the area with 15 minutes remaining.
 The locals made much of the running in extra time, with Salman Ouald El Haj fouled on the edge of the area by Angel Berlanga - the Spaniard earning the first and only yellow card of the contest.
 Moghreb could not create any danger from the free-kick, Ahmed Jahouh's effort blocked by the wall, before Auckland had a fine chance in the second half of the additional 30 minutes to steal victory.
 De Vries' cross to the back post found Berlanga, who powered a header wide of the target.
 It did not matter, though, as Auckland advanced following a thrilling shootout.

The hosts faded after a promising start to the decisive Group E clash, where City midfielder Samir Nasri clattered home a 25-yard strike via the inside of the post with an hour played.
 Roma's Kostas Manolas saw his header tipped onto the post by visiting goalkeeper Joe Hart before Pablo Zabaleta struck four minutes from time to ensure the Premier League powerhouse progressed in second place behind group winners Bayern Munich.
 "We knew even without some players that City were strong and they proved it," Garcia told _Mediaset_ after the match, before identifying Nasri and Manolas' respective efforts as being key to the outcome.
 "It was a very balanced game and you need luck too, so tonight fortune chose its team with those two uprights. I do think we could've scored and done something more in this game.
 "Manchester City have more experience and maturity at this level, whereas we are learning and need to improve some elements. We also need some even stronger players if we are to reach teams of that level.
 "We should've made more of our opening half-hour, when we had City on the ropes. Similarly, you can't allow a player like Nasri to shoot undisturbed from distance.
 "They are not the Premier League holders for nothing. I am really disappointed for the lads, as it was possible to do better and qualify, but it shows us the steps we still need to climb in order to be among Europe's top clubs."
 Roma's continental season will continue in the UEFA Europa League in 2015, and Garcia is ready to prioritise Serie A ahead of Europe's second-tier competition.
 "If we want to play the Champions League again, then we need a great Serie A campaign," he said.
 "We have the Europa League now, which is an international tournament, but the league remains our main objective."

He did live commentary during this edition's Candidates Chess in Russia but GM Vidit Gujrathi is now aiming be a part of the next edition along with an entry in world 's top-10 rankings. The Candidates event was cancelled due to the COVD-19 pandemic. Gujrathi is now working on his game with a lot of time at his disposal.
 "Now everything will be delayed by a year. It gives me more time. My aim is to reach the world top 10. Also, the aim is to qualify for the next Candidates event," Gujrathi told PTI on Thursday. "I did commentary during the Candidates tournament in Russia and enjoyed it. Also, I have done commentary during my lives games," Gujrathi added.
 The India No.2, who had broken into the top 20 of the FIDE rankings before slipping to the current 23, aims to be consistent over the next few years and break into the top 10. "My next aim is to improve my world ranking, I became world No.18 but slipped (to 23 now). I want to reach the top 10 in the world." Though the sporting world has come to a standstill owing to the coronavirus pandemic, he is occupied with online events and hopes to work on his game while setting sights on breaking into the top 10.
 "The main advantage of chess is that it can be played online. I am able to practice online and also take part in (online) tournaments as many events are held," he further added. The 25-year old is confined to his home in Nashik, but is not allowing boredom to take over as he spends about six-seven hours on the game.
 "I practice and play for six-seven hours each day and that keeps me occupied. Also, there are online tournaments I take part in. I wish to keep improving and break into the world's top 10," he added. Gujrathi's current ELO rating of 2726 in the FIDE list second to former world champion Viswanathan Anand (ranked 15th in the world).
 He recently took part in the online exhibition event organised by chess.com to raise funds for PM-CARES Fund for COVID-19 relief during which Rs 4.5 lakh was raised..

Patients needing to visit with a health care provider at any of Athens- Limestone Hospital's 15 affiliated clinics may be able to do it from the safety of their own home or without taking significant time off work.
 ALH recently announced all of its clinics now offer the option of telemedicine appointments, or meeting with a doctor or nurse practitioner via phone or video call instead of in person. Dr. Maria Acelajado of Valley Internal Medicine said it's great for patients who simply need to check in or discuss a prescription refill without the hassle of driving to the doctor's office. The option has also been popularized by some mental health care providers.
 "(Health care providers) can do the same things they would do in a visit except listen to a heart or lung," Acelajado said. "... It keeps (patients) safe in this day and age, because they don't have to go to a doctor's office for that or get out of their house."

From a sales perspective, Peloton looks like an overwhelming success. Revenue through the first half of its current fiscal year jumped 85% to $694 million as it benefited from the attention on its IPO last September and a strong holiday season. However, the company is bleeding cash. It spent about a third of that revenue on sales and marketing, a sign of high acquisition costs, and it had an operating loss of $112 million in the first half of the year. Though Peloton gets plenty of word-of-mouth marketing, its sales growth is being driven by spending on media, its showrooms, and other brand awareness initiatives. During a recession, customer acquisition costs will almost certainly increase as potential customers will need more convincing to take the plunge and buy a Peloton, which will further weigh on its bottom line.

Vocalist-activist TM Krishna on Thursday called out film personalities for tone-deaf messaging amid the coronavirus pandemic and asked them to stay quiet if they “cannot be honest about what is staring at us everyday.”
 The Chennai-based singer, in a series of tweets, said irrespective of political leanings, people in privileged positions must either call a spade a spade or “shut up.”
 “Can these filmy types please shut up and stay in their farm houses/fancy apartments,” Krishna began.
 The 44-year-old Carnatic vocalist said these celebrities have nothing to say about thousands of migrant workers rendered jobless, homeless and hungry by the nationwide lockdown since March 25.
 “Not a word on the number of workers stuck in various parts of the country struggling for food and shelter. Not a word on the mess the government of India has created and the complete lack of any care. Not a word on the risks they are facing,” he wrote.
 Krishna also alleged that celebrities kept mum about the government’s delayed measures to fight the deadly virus.
 “Not a word on the fact the this government woke up late and then shut down the country overnight, letting people suffer and struggle to make sense of their lives while people clapped, banged on plates and later lit diyas.”
 He also criticised the fraternity for promoting physical distancing, “a fancy middle-class idea” that most of India simply cannot practice as many people live in one small room.
 “Not a word on the abysmal testing levels,” Krishna said.
 “Irrespective of your political leanings, if you just cannot be honest about what is staring at us everyday. Just shut up,” he concluded.

There are reasons to be skeptical of negotiations with jihadists. Mali has a history, stretching back more than a decade, of one-off deals and ad hoc arrangements with jihadists — including prisoner releases, suspected collusion, and tolerance by local authorities in parts of the north. Some of the Malian authorities’ past actions appeared to pay off in the short run, but were ultimately destabilizing over time. And just this year, Kouffa’s men appear to be responsible for the kidnapping of Malian opposition leader Soumaïla Cissé — and for the recent kidnapping of another politician dispatched to negotiate Cissé’s release. These latest moves are a potentially ominous sign for the prospects of a bigger deal.
