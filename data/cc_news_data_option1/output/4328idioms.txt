However, later that day President Donald Trump issued an executive order to redesignate career employees in "confidential, policy-determining, policy making, and policy-advocating positions" as falling under a set of rules that primarily applies to political appointees. Such "excepted service" positions do not require competition in hiring, nor even public notice that a position is available, do not allow for union representation and do not allow for appeals of disciplinary actions including firing.
 In resigning, Sanders said that although he is a lifelong Republican, he "cannot in good conscience continue" to serve the administration. Trump's order "seeks to make loyalty to him the litmus test for many thousands of career civil servants, and that is something I cannot be part of."
 The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
 Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., called Sanders' resignation "unfortunate but honorable."
 "Everyone should be outraged by Trump's radical attack on the federal workforce, which seeks to take America's civil service back 137 years to a time when political loyalty was deemed more important than merit or skill," he said in a statement.
 "It's extremely late in the day to do the right thing but he's doing the right thing," said Jacqueline Simon, a member of the salary council who often clashed with Sanders over policy matters.
 "This executive order was somehow either a last straw or a bridge too far," said Simon, public policy director of the American Federation of Government Employees. "I think it's the worst thing Trump has done on the civil service."

So when we look at "boom or bust" potential in the 2020 NBA Draft, we have to remember that everything is relative. If the No. 28 pick is out of the league in a few years, most people probably won't remember. But if the same thing happens to a top-five pick, he'll probably be labeled a bust. Drafting is difficult enough as it is, but consider the odd scouting process of 2020, where teams haven't gotten their usual look at college and international prospects due to COVID-19, and we could have some big mistakes at the top of the draft -- and possibly some franchise-changing picks further down.

 While Joe Biden commands a double-digit lead in the polls two weeks before the election, President Trump is running scared -- and for good reason.
 If he loses -- a prospect that appears more and more likely come Nov. 3 -- he not only faces a mountain of debt from his failed business deals but the possibility of serious jail time.
 As a private citizen he'll no longer be immune from prosecution for things like fraud or sexual assault, which means the law will finally catch up with him. Like a tiger trapped in a cage, he's desperate to find a way out.
 That makes him all the more dangerous in the run-up to Election Day. And it's anybody's guess what he'll do if it doesn't go his way.
 First, let's look at the fraud allegations.
 On Oct. 13, Trump asked the U.S. Supreme Court to freeze a lower court order allowing Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance to conduct a criminal probe into his finances. Trump called it political harassment.
 While the DA's investigation initially focused on hush money payments to adult-film star Stormy Daniels and a Playboy model to keep them quiet about their sexual encounters with Trump, the probe has since expanded to include Trump's potential bank, tax and insurance fraud and falsification of business records.
 Meanwhile, a New York Times investigation revealed that Trump paid only $750 in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017 and no income taxes at all in 10 of the prior 15 years. It also revealed he received a $72.9 million tax refund that is now under IRS audit. The financial pressure on him also increases as more than $400 million in loans he personally guaranteed are coming due.
 What about the sexual allegations?
 Since 1970, at least 25 women have accused Trump of rape, sexual assault and harassment. The latest woman to come forward, a former model named Amy Dorris, revealed last month that Trump kissed and groped her against her will in Trump's private box at the U.S. Open tennis tournament in 1997. She was 24 at the time.
 That by itself might not land a person in jail, but consider the accusation made by writer E. Jean Carroll that Trump raped her in a Manhattan department store. The latest twist in that case is that Trump is now the subject of a defamation suit brought by Carroll for accusing her of lying.
 It doesn't end there. Last month Attorney General and Trump loyalist William Barr moved to replace Trump's private defense team with Justice Department lawyers at taxpayer expense. After all, how can a president do his job when he's distracted by frivolous lawsuits?
 In the corrupt world of Trump, it is what it is. Which brings us back to the Times investigation. How will Trump pay off his debts if he can't put the arm on people who seek presidential favors? More to the point, how will he satisfy his creditors if he's locked up in a prison?
 Maybe he could sell the naming rights. Come to think of it, \"Trump/Alcatraz\" has a rather nice ring.

BOSTON (AP) — A man was charged with lighting a fire in a Boston ballot drop box and damaging dozens of ballots, police said Monday. Worldy Armand, a 39-year-old Boston resident, was taken into custody late Sunday after drug control unit officers on patrol saw a man who matched the description of the suspect authorities were looking for in the ballot box fire, police said. Police said he also had an active warrant for receiving stolen property. Armand faces a charge of willful and malicious burning, police said. It was not immediately clear whether he has an attorney to comment on his behalf. The FBI said Sunday that it’s investigating the fire that was set around 4 a.m. in a ballot drop box outside the Boston Public Library downtown. Officers called to the scene saw smoke coming out of the box before firefighters managed to extinguish the fire by filling the box with water, police said. There were 122 ballots inside the box when it was emptied Sunday morning, and 87 of them were still legible and able to be processed, Galvin’s office said. Voters can go online to see whether their ballot was processed. Those who used that dropbox between Saturday afternoon and 4 a.m. Sunday and can’t confirm the status of their ballot online should contact the Boston Elections Department immediately, officials said. Voters whose ballots were affected can either vote in person or by a replacement ballot that will be mailed to them, officials said. If those voters don’t submit a new ballot, “their original ballot will be hand-counted to the extent possible,” election officials said.The FBI said in a statement announcing their investigation that “it is a top priority of our offices to help maintain the integrity of the election process in Massachusetts by aggressively enforcing federal election laws.”Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Put down the pencils. Hang the costumes in the closet. And put the blade covers back on the skates.
 Lest anyone forget, the cororavirus is giving Massachusetts a not-so-gentle reminder that it never really left.
 Boston was the latest community to pull back on in-person learning, as Hub schools went completely remote with transmission of the coronavirus continuing to increase in the city.
 Boston's exit from the classroom earned the city a mention on the presidential debate stage Thursday night where President Donald Trump continued to insist the country had turned a corner in its fight against the virus. Gov. Charlie Baker hasn't gone that far -- and doesn't agree with the president on much these days -- but on the issue of schools the two Republicans seem to be reading from the same page.
 Baker said he wouldn't "Monday morning quarterback" Mayor Marty Walsh's decision for Boston, but said again that it's not schools where the virus is spreading. Instead, the governor continued to blame social gatherings, primarily of 19- to 39-year-olds, where masks are not being worn and distancing not observed.
 It's not all retreat
 In Massachusetts, the daily new case count almost reached 1,000 on Thursday and the seven-day weighted average positive test rate ticked up to 1.5% as 77 cities and towns are now in the state's highest-risk "red" category.
 In MetroWest, Ashland joined Framingham, Marlborough, Milford, Holliston, Hudson and Southborough as a red community.
 On Thursday night, the Department of Public Health decided to shut down ice skating rinks due to clusters of infections the state has observed linked to hockey games, practices and tournaments.
 The state, however, is far from being in retreat.
 In fact, Baker this week called attention to what his administration described as an ongoing $775 million economic stimulus program that included $115 million in just available funding, the highlight of which was a new $50.8 million grant program for hard hit small businesses.
 "To be clear, there's no substitute for the size and scope that a federal aid package could deliver. But that doesn't seem to be in the offing and we certainly don't believe that we can wait," Baker said
 Other things red
 With less than two weeks until voting ends in Massachusetts, more than a quarter of the state's 4.6 million registered voters have already cast their ballots. Of the 1.3 million votes cast, almost 890,000 have been by mail, with the rest of the voters turning up in person since early voting opened on Oct. 17.
 So for a good chunk of the electorate, Baker was too late when he endorsed Republican Kevin O'Connor in the Dover attorney's longshot race against U.S. Sen. Edward Markey. In a hand-held cellphone video, Baker said O'Connor would bring "feet-on-the-ground" representation to Washington.
 But the O'Connor endorsement was perhaps more notable for the fact that Baker chose to back another Republican for Senate, along with Susan Collins of Maine. If O'Connor were to win, the odds of the GOP retaining control of the U.S. Senate increase greatly, although it can't be assumed that's what Baker wants, even if he is trying to shore up his right flank.
 The governor has been frustrated with both parties in Washington, but particularly his own. He has criticized Congress' inability to get a stimulus deal done, and disagrees with the decision of Republicans to press forward with the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.
 And, of course, he is not voting for President Donald Trump for re-election.
 Meet the chief
 Framingham Mayor Yvonne Spicer is moderating a Zoom meeting at 5 p.m. Monday in which the community is invited to learn more about the two finalists for police chief.
 One is surely a familiar face -- Deputy Police Chief Lester Baker, who's been on the force since 2003. And the other might be, at least for some. He's James Rhoden Jr., major/commander of the Baltimore Police Department -- the same James Rhoden who was selected to replace Thomas O'Loughlin as Milford's police chief earlier this year.
 Rhoden declined the offer, saying it was best for his family to remain in Baltimore.
 For Monday's Zoom session, each candidate will be given equal time to provide an overview of his vision for the Framingham Police Department and answer questions from the community.
 To participate in Monday's Zoom session, visit framinghamma.gov/calendar.
 Those who cannot attend but have questions are asked to email kmcfalls@framinghamma.gov with the subject line: "October 26, Framingham Police Chief Candidate Zoom." A recording of the meeting will be provided to everybody who emails a question(s).
 Twenty-one people initially applied to replace Steven Trask, who retired in June. Ron Brandolini has served as acting chief since then, but did not apply for the permanent job.

While there was no shortage of bling on the feet of riders at the 2020 Giro d'Italia, the most interesting shoes hands down of course belong to Adam Hansen. The veteran rider for years had made his own crazy-light footwear to the tune of 55g or less per shoe. He's even been known to forego cleat bolts, and use Kevlar lacing to further reduce weight.

Dear Dad,
   
 Even though you've been gone for almost 15 years, I want to explain why I am voting for a Democrat for president this year. I know you were a lifelong and loyal Republican, proud of the fact that Jerry Ford was from your hometown of Grand Rapids. I remember giving you Jimmy Carter's biography for your birthday one year, just to prove that a Democrat could be a Christian. Maybe it was about that time that I began thinking about becoming an Independent, putting the person ahead of party.
   
 Dad, you would not believe what is happening politically in 2020. The man running as a Republican for re-election is someone I do not want my grandchildren to hear speak. You always taught us to be respectful of others, but this man uses such demeaning language and calls anyone who disagrees with him the most caustic and belittling names. He is the definition of a bully. He also denigrates and fires those who disagree with him, no matter how well qualified they are for the position they hold. The definition of democracy that I learned in middle school -- "government of the people, by the people, for the people" -- no longer holds true.
   
 You were an honest businessman who always treated your employees and customers with respect. I knew the source of your guidance and strength because I saw you on your knees in prayer every night. I also remember how much you read and treasured the Bible. Although our current president has the endorsement of most Evangelicals, there seems to be a huge disconnect in so many areas between what Scripture says and how this president governs and lives.
   
 I still have your Army uniform and many pictures from the nearly five years you spent in the Army during WWII. Your account of opening the concentration camp at Dachau was beyond my comprehension, as were the photos of the ovens and gas chambers. You came home, but your best friend didn't. This president does not seem to understand, respect or value the sacrifices men and women are willing to make for their country. He often talks about building up the military, but it seems to be more for "bragging rights" among other countries.
   
 His lack of character and honesty has been apparent for the past four years, but his lack of empathy is now "front and center" because of a worldwide pandemic. People are suffering and dying at an alarming rate, especially here in the U.S. This president refuses to lead in a way that could really make a difference. He instead is going around the country holding large rallies without the precautions advised by the scientists who are studying this virus. He is making things so much worse; he seems to care only about his own re- election, not the hundreds of thousands in this country who have died, not their grieving families, and not the stressed-out healthcare workers. In perhaps the cruelest act of all, he is currently trying to take away the healthcare plan of millions.
   
 We currently have a governor in Michigan (a Democrat and a woman) who has been trying for the past seven months to keep us safe from this awful, highly contagious virus. There have been laws about wearing masks, physical distancing and limits on businesses. The president, caring more about the economy and how it will influence the election, has so ramped up his criticism of our governor's actions that a plot to kidnap and "get rid" of her has recently been uncovered. There are active militia groups who have been encouraged by the president's obvious disdain and disrespect for our governor.
   
 The president's opponent, Joe Biden, is not the most exciting, dynamic candidate, but we need an honest leader with integrity and empathy to end the chaos of the past few years, just as Jerry Ford did after Nixon. I am aware of many always-Republicans who are now supporting Biden because they know our country cannot survive another four years of this "impressed-with-himself" would-be autocrat.
   
 As Martin Luther King once said, "We need leaders not in love with money but in love with justice, not in love with publicity but in love with humanity." Joe Biden fits those criteria. Dad, you always encouraged us to stand up for what we believe, and I will. I do wonder if you and I would be on the same page this year. I miss you.
