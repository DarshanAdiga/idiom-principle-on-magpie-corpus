The young Robins were slow off the mark, quite possibly owing to nerves, and quickly found themselves 0-2 down. However, they dug deep and managed to find an excellent response. Indeed, they were soon back on level terms thanks to a quick-fire double from Freddie Shipway. As the game flowed from end to end Lympstone were awarded a penalty, which glovesman Lee Blake saved, but was then beaten by the attacker slotting home the rebound. Once again back came Budleigh with Freddie Shipway completing his hat-trick to leave the game ending with honours even at 3-3. This represents a well-earned, and richly deserved away point from a game in which Charlie Fremantle was named Budleigh's young Robin's Man of the Match

Sept 23 (Reuters) - The NBA's long-standing engagement in China continues to have a "net positive" impact on the mutual understanding between the United States and the Communist nation, Commissioner Adam Silver told CNN on Tuesday.
 The NBA has built a reputation as the most socially progressive of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and in the last year has come under pressure to cut its ties with China over its alleged human rights abuses.
 "Somebody could say given the system of government in China you, the NBA, should make a decision not to operate there," Silver said in an interview.
 "I would only say that at the end of the day, I think those are decisions for our government in terms of where American business should operate.
 "I continue to believe that the people-to-people exchanges we're seeing by playing in China are positive, and it's helping. It helps cultures learn about each other. It allows us to export sort of American values to China."
 The NBA's previously harmonious relationship with the Chinese government suffered a major setback last October when Houston Rockets executive Daryl Morey tweeted his support for Hong Kong protesters.
 The league lost millions of dollars in sponsorships over the row and its games were taken off state broadcaster CCTV, which dominates television sports coverage in China.
 "We could have decided because they took us off Chinese Central Television (CCTV) that we should ... take our ball and go home and stop operating there," Silver added.
 "The fact is our games continue to be streamed ... and we've continued in there. At least that's my view, that it's been net positive to not move to disengagement."
 In July, the NBA said it was re-evaluating its training programme in China following allegations of abuse of young players by local staff and harassment of foreign staffers at a facility in Xinjiang.
 Silver said the NBA's relationship with the world's most populous nation goes back to the late 1970s, when China was all but closed to American businesses.
 "As the years have gone on, the NBA has increased its presence in China, but always until very recent history at the encouragement of the State Department, of various administrations, again, from both sides of the aisle," Silver said.
 "It was viewed as a really positive thing that we were exporting American values to China through the NBA." (Reporting by Nick Mulvenney; Editing by Peter Rutherford)

In general fibre to the premises (FTTP) is considered the fastest available NBN connection type. This is because it has the lowest speed degradation and highest potential for download and upload speeds. This is because of how direct the connection is compared to those that combine older technology with fibre.
 FTTP connects a premises directly to the NBN through a fibre optic cable. A multi-fibre ribbon runs from the closest fibre distribution hub and a home gets its own dedicated fibre from it.
 Replacing copper with direct fibre connections to the homes of half its FTTP customers will allow up to 1 gigabit speeds. It also means that these customers will be able to access NBN 1000 and NBN 250 plans.
 At the present these top speed tier plans are only available to FTTP and a small portion of HFC customers.
 ## So the NBN upgrade is a good thing?
 It’s definitely an exciting upgrade, at least on paper. The execution remains to me seen. It’s also something that should have happened a long time ago. Direct fibre connection was the original plan Labor had for the network. However the Coalition opted for incremental upgrades of older internet connections, instead.
 Seven years, late delivery, slow connections and a lot of borrowed money later it looks like the government is finally ready to go with the original plan and take credit for it.

LONDON (AP) — The British government says there could be lines of 7,000 trucks at the English Channel and two-day waits to get into France immediately after the U.K. makes its economic break from the European Union at the end of the year. Michael Gove, the minister in charge of Brexit preparations, described that as a reasonable worst-case scenario in a letter to logistics firms. He’s due to give more details to Parliament on Wednesday. The government letter says that between 30% and 50% of trucks wanting to cross the Channel may not be ready for new paperwork and regulations that will come into effect on Jan. 1. “This could lead to maximum queues of 7,000 port-bound trucks in Kent and associated maximum delays of up to two days,” the document said. The U.K. withdrew from the EU’s political institutions on Jan. 31 but remains in a tariff-free transition period until the end of the year while negotiators try to work out a future trade relationship. Even with a deal, Britain will be leaving the bloc’s single market and customs union, meaning some new checks and trade barriers. Without a deal there will be much greater disruption, with the U.K. and the EU having to slap tariffs on each others’ goods.

The general manager of a Rockhampton beef processing plant will promote Queensland’s food as part of a state government promotional campaign.
 Teys Australia’s Wasantha Mudannayake has been named Queensland’s 17th #eatqld representative.
 Mr Mudannayake said the accolade provided an opportunity to advertise meat from what was generally regarded as Australia’s beef capital.
 “I am proud to support local beef producers who continually rise to meet the various challenges thrown their way to deliver truly world-class products,” he said.
 “Working for Teys Australia has given me a great insight into the quality of our locally produced beef and I encourage everyone to get behind our local producers.”
 Rockhampton MP Barry O’Rourke said Mr Mudannayake was a shining example of what could be achieved with a career in the agriculture and food processing sector.
 “From humble beginnings 30 years ago working nights as a floor cleaner at Teys Australia Beenleigh, Mr Mudannayake studied hard at university to further his professional development, rising to become general manager in 2006,” he said.
 “Mr Mudannayake now oversees the second biggest meat processing plant in Australia with an annual turnover of more than $620 million and employing more than 900 people.
 Mr O’Rourke said Mr Mudannayake was also on the Advance Rockhampton Board and the Queensland Government’s Manufacturing Ministerial Council.
 Agricultural Industry Development Minister Mr Furner said the Queensland Government’s #eatqld campaign encouraged people to eat local produce to support the state’s agricultural sector.
 “Our produce is second to none,” he said.
 “By eating Queensland-produced meat, seafood, fruit, nuts and veggies you support everybody that brings that food to your table.”

ISLAMABAD, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 23rd Sep, 2020 ) :Pakistan's head coach-cum-chief selector Misbah-ul-Haq believes it was very important for a player's development to play the longer version game, saying at the end of the day Test records were considered as compared to the one-day international (ODI) and Twenty20 cricket.
 "It is very important for players' to play the longer version game as you limit yourself by playing only shorter format cricket. Players' career prolongs by playing Test cricket and at the end of the day nobody thinks of the Twenty20 or ODI records but Tests." "People remember of how many 100s Mohammad Yousuf did and Younis Khan scored 10,000 runs or Wasim Akram bagged 500 wickets in Test cricket. If you want yourself to be remembered in the World then you have to play Test cricket. We are trying the players' to focus on the longer version game," he said in an interview to Cricingif.
 He was of the view that a player cannot develop his skills from league, ODI or T20 cricket. "If you play your domestic cricket which is an investment for the longer version game, then you can develop yourself and your career will be prolonged and T20 and ODI cricket will become easy for you," he said.
 Speaking about Pakistan's prolific batsman and limited-overs Skipper Babar Azam, he said the Lahore-born cricketer was in the learning process.

“Yes. It’s been one of the brightest aspects of this whole thing. It took me a long time to get to grips with the fact I wouldn’t be touring and the realisation that from the beginning of my professional career in 1972, this is the longest I’ve not travelled in my entire career. But I decided to make the most of it, and I’ve written more songs in the last four months than I have in the last four years.”

Sosyal medya platformu Facebook, Avrupa Birliği'nden (AB) ABD'ye veri transferini etkileyen yeni kurallar nedeniyle, Facebook ve Instagram uygulamalarının AB üyesi ülkelerdeki faaliyetlerini durdurabileceğini açıkladı.
   
 BBC Türkçe'nin Business Insider'ın haberinden aktardığına göre, şirket, 10 Eylül'de İrlanda Yüksek Mahkemesi'ne bir şikayet dilekçesi sundu.
   
 Facebook dilekçede, İrlanda'nın veri mahremiyeti kurumu Veri Koruma Komiserliği (DPC) tarafından verilen ve AB'den ABD'ye veri transferini mahremiyet kaygıları nedeniyle engelleme tehdidinde bulunulan talimata karşı çıkıyor.
   
 Facebook'un İrlanda'daki Veri Koruma Yetkilisi ve Genel Danışmanı Yvonne Cunnane'nin kaleme aldığı dilekçede, "Müracaat sahibinin (Facebook) DPC'nin istediği gibi, kullanıcı verilerinin ABD'ye transferinin tamamen durdurulması emrine tabi olması durumunda, müracaat sahibinin bu koşullar altında Facebook ve Instagram hizmetlerini AB'de nasıl sunmaya devam edebileceği net değil" deniliyor.
   
 Dilekçede ayrıca, Facebook'un Avrupa'da aylık 410 milyon aktif kullanıcısı olduğu hatırlatılıyor. Bir Facebook sözcüsü, bu ifadelerin "AB'den çekilme tehdidi" anlamına geldiğini reddetti. Sözcü yaptığı yazılı açıklamada, "Facebook Avrupa'dan çekilme tehdidinde bulunmuyor. İrlanda Yüksek Mahkemesi'ne sunulan belgelerde, Facebook'un birçok diğer işletme, organizasyon ve hizmet gibi, işlerliğine devam edebilmesi ve hizmet sunabilmesi için, AB ve ABD arasında veri transferine bağımlı olduğu gibi basit bir gerçekliğe dikkat çekiliyor" dedi.
   
 Açıklamada ayrıca; "Güvenli ve yasal uluslararası veri transferinin olmaması, tam da Covid-19 krizinden toparlanma yolları ararken, ekonomiye ve AB'de veri tabanlı işletmelerin büyümesine zarar verir" ifadeleri yer alıyor. Facebook'un dilekçesinde, DPC'nin kendileri dışında hiçbir ABD'li teknoloji şirketini hedef almadığı ve adil olmayan bir muameleye maruz kaldıklarından da şikayet ediliyor.

 After constructing the tool, The Markup looked at 80,000 of the world’s most popular website and found that more than 5,000 of them were “identifying them even if they block third-party cookies”. Yikes!

He completed three years of a History and Archaeology degree before the lure of theatre became too irresistible – then came the Karolos Koun story at the Art Theatre, then the backstage visit by Evis Gavrielides, the decision to relocate (mainly for financial reasons, though his marriage was breaking down too) and, with the brief exception of lockdown, he’s been gainfully employed ever since. “Touch wood, ever since 1981 I’ve been working in the theatre every day without fail,” he admits. “I’ve never stopped – whether as an actor or director, or as the head of the Organisation, I’ve never stopped working. Every day, every day.”

Mary Jacobi Meeh,88, went to be with Jesus on Sept 1, 2020. She was born in New Jersey but lived in the Clear Lake area since 1962, most as an original resident of her beloved Timber Cove. She is survived by her four children David, Holly, Tom, and Peter as well as three daughters-in-law Cindy, Deanne, and Terry. She had six grandchildren and eight great grandchildren. Mary appreciated everything about nature, and loved spending time outdoors, whether camping in most of the National Parks, birding, or tending the plants in her back yard. Mary particularly loved walking along the beach, crabbing, riding the ferry to Bolivar, or sailing with her family. She passed these loves on to all her kids. She was also incredibly creative- painting, sewing, hula and belly dancing, playing the ukulele and organ, and making stained glass pieces were all pastimes. She volunteered many hours as a docent with the Houston Symphony and enjoyed countless productions at Miller Outdoor Theater. She loved Jesus, was active in her church and participated in BSF. A celebration of her life will be held October 3, 2020 at 2pm at Nassau Bay Baptist Church, 18131 Nassau Bay Dr, 77058 To make honorariums via mail or online to Armand Bayou Nature Center in honor of Mary Meeh, go to https://www.abnc.org/donate or use their EIN#23-7403757.
