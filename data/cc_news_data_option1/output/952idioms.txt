As soon as Dalia steps into the office, you can't help but have a big smile on your face and know that you will be up for a not-so-typical day with her presence! The youngest member of the Fustany Team is really a moving bundle of joy with an eclectic sense of fashion and style. Marc Jacobs is her favorite designer yet at the same time she adores the artistic vibe of Alexander McQueen and the quirkiness of Lanvin. Throwing jokes here and there, Dalia keeps her energy levels up by making sure she eats an apple everyday, as she thinks of it as her Red Bull can. Her over-sized handbag includes the most random things, think pantoufle (true story!) and her camera that she loves and can rarely be spotted without. Dalia might surprise you with her alter ego when you least expect it, be ready for it or for her other 10 personalities, we think she has an awesome acting career ahead of her. A typical Dalia moment at the office is casually finding her talking to herself while video-editing! Dalia would never leave home without her iPhone, blusher, mascara and Gucci perfume. You can reach her on dalia@fustany.com or on Twitter @DaliaHosny.

Why kick 3.3 volts and 5 volts to the curb?
 Still, eliminating the production of 3.3-volt and 5-volt power, or “rails,” in the PSU itself is a major change. PCs originally ran mostly on 5 volts, but over time they’ve shifted mostly to 12-volt power. One PSU maker, for example, pointed to a circa-2006, 600-watt supply it made that had 25 percent of its power dedicated to 3.3-volt and 5-volt rails. Wind the clock forward ten years, and a similar 600-watt PSU made by the same company now budgets just 15 percent for 3.3-volt and 5-volt power.
 Efficiency (how effective the PSU is at converting the AC from the wall to DC that the PC needs) has evolved, too. The 2006 PSU operated at 78-percent efficiency, while the 2016 PSU has a 98-percent efficiency rating. That means the 2006 PSU would have to consume about 127 watts of AC from the wall to generate about 99 watts, while the 2016 PSU would consume about 100 watts to produce 98 watts of power.
 Because ATX12VO removes so many rails, the thick 24-pin Main Power Connector would drastically drop down to a tiny 10-pin connector, similar to what we saw with Intel’s Compute Element earlier this year.

They might be worried regarding inferior quality plus might favor a ‘tried-and-tested’ brand, particularly for rather as crucial to everyday comfort as shoes. Though customization is by all odds more likely in this market than the regular, it is similar to a type of mass customization. Players are usually limited by some items which are customizable moreover there would be lots of variants about some core things that will stay unchanged.
