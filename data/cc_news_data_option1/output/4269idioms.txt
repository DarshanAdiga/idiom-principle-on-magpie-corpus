CHARLESTON COUNTY, S.C. (WCSC) - The South Carolina Department of Natural Resources says Oct. 31 marks the ‘official’ end of sea turtle nesting season.With a few nests left to hatch, state biologists say they are pleased to report that sea turtles in South Carolina had a productive nesting season.SCDNR says preliminary estimates show sea turtles laid approximately 5,500 nests on South Carolina beaches, putting the year on par with nest counts in 2015 (5,109 nests) and 2017 (5,250 nests).With a record 8,797 nests laid in South Carolina, SCDNR says the 2019 season marked a tremendous departure from the norm regionally.Female sea turtles do not nest every year, so biologists say fluctuations are expected from year to year.Overall, SCDNR says the 2020 numbers reflect an encouraging trend of increasing nest numbers along the southeastern coast as four decades of sea turtle conservation work begin to come of age.The arrival of COVID-19 in South Carolina just before the start of nesting season forced an immediate shutdown of preseason activities, but eventually, SCDNR says staff and volunteers reworked their operating procedures to accommodate the new health crisis.“It was touch and go at the beginning of the season,” SCDNR biologist Michelle Pate said. “We needed to determine how to engage our large volunteer networks in this important conservation work while ensuring we did not put their health at risk. As usual, our many dedicated volunteers rose to the challenge to collect another valuable season of data and ensure a successful outcome for nests.”SCDNR says Pandemic-related difficulties persisted through the season for some sea turtle teams, particularly on state and federal beaches such as those in Cape Romain, which represents the densest nesting area in the state.Working under federal restrictions, the already-limited staff there say they had to count, protect, and later inventory thousands of nests without the usual help of volunteers.“Jerry Tupacz and Billy Shaw under the leadership of and alongside Sarah Dawsey continued to make miracles happen out at Cape Romain with the sea turtle project this year despite budget and staffing shortfalls, coupled with the additional challenges of 2020,” Pate said. “These folks have an unwavering drive and focused mindset to get the business at hand done regardless of difficulties laid before them. The Refuge is a special and important area for sea turtles in the Northern Recovery Unit and we are indebted to them for their efforts.”Hurricane season presents a threat to sea turtle nests every year, and while coastal communities escaped largely unscathed in 2020, SCDNR says Hurricane Isaias impacted hundreds of nests north of Charleston in early August.Overall, SCDNR says an estimated 7% of the state’s nests were lost this year to high tide events and storms, including Isaias.Copyright 2020 WCSC.

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial information is prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"), except that the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders' equity, consolidated statements of cash flows, and the detailed notes have not been presented. The Company uses non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income attributable to CLPS Incorporation's shareholders, and basic and diluted non-GAAP net income per share, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP operating income is operating income excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP operating margin is non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of revenues. Non-GAAP net income attributable to CLPS Incorporation's shareholders is net income attributable to CLPS Incorporation's shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses. Basic and diluted non-GAAP net income per share is non- GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders divided by weighted average number of shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share. The Company believes that separate analysis and exclusion of the non-cash impact of share-based compensation expenses clarity to the constituent parts of its performance. The Company reviews these non-GAAP financial measures together with GAAP financial measures to obtain a better understanding of its operating performance. It uses the non-GAAP financial measure for planning, forecasting and measuring results against the forecast. The Company believes that non-GAAP financial measure is useful supplemental information for investors and analysts to assess its operating performance without the effect of non-cash share-based compensation expenses, which have been and will continue to be significant recurring expenses in its business. However, the use of non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations as an analytical tool. One of the limitations of using non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not include all items that impact the Company's net income for the period. In addition, because non-GAAP financial measures are not measured in the same manner by all companies, they may not be comparable to other similar titled measures used by other companies. In light of the foregoing limitations, you should not consider non-GAAP financial measure in isolation from or as an alternative to the financial measure prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

TAUNTON -- City government has moved into the newly renovated, rebuilt and expanded City Hall on Summer Street.
 Mayor Shaunna O'Connell said they are excited, as it not only gives them more space and a modern set up to work with, but because it will allow them to better serve their constituents.
 "It's much more functional than where we are now at the old school. We're really excited to be moving to our beautiful, restored City Hall." O'Connell said during a recent tour "There are such beautiful views here in our building that give you a deep sense of appreciation for our community, our history and for all our citizens in the city of Taunton."
 According to the mayor's office, though most city offices are not where they used to be, the renovated building's layout is more conducive to public use for many reasons. First, if entering from the rear parking lot, the most frequented city offices are easily accessible. The city clerk and tax collector's offices are on the first floor as you enter the building, and the veteran's and registrar of voters offices are on the street level if entering from Summer Street.
 Second, the city council chamber is now handicap accessible.
 The first floor of the building, at the rear parking level, also holds the treasurer's and IT department offices. The second floor, level with Summer Street, also houses the assessor's and clerk of committee's offices. On the third floor is the office of economic and community development and the auditor's office, and the fourth floor houses the mayor's, law and budget director's offices.
 City officials moved back into the building for the first time in a decade. Originally built in 1848, it was damaged in an arson fire in 2010 which forced city government out and into a temporary city hall on Oak Street fashioned out of an old elementary school.
 After years of deliberation, construction began on the building in February 2019, and is just now concluding. The project cost $27 million.
 "A lot of work has gone into this over the last few years by people too numerous to mention, but we appreciate all our efforts," O'Connell said.
 The project preserved many of the building's history features, such as antique fireplaces and vaults. O'Connell said this is one of her favorite things about the renovated building, as it respects the city's long history.
 O'Connell also said the space and facilities at the new building stand in stark contrast to that available to them at the temporary City Hall. During the tour, she described many offices at the Oak Street building as being "like a closet."
 "It's a big difference here, and it really will give our employees the ability to serve the public so much better," she said.
 All city offices were operational in the building as of Oct. 15. Tours of the building began Saturday. Registration is required before the tour and is available on the city's website through the mayor's tab.

With the coronavirus still raging, stores and malls are having to rework their typical holiday strategy, which had been to pack as many people through its doors as possible. Walmart, for example, is holding its Black Friday deals over four weeks, instead of one day.But the decision by Macy’s differs from big mall owners, which will still go ahead with in-person Santa visits by banning kids from sitting on his lap and making sure they stay six feet away from him.Macy’s has been using Santa Claus to draw crowds to its New York store since the early 1860s, calling itself “The Home of Santa Claus” for decades. And Macy’s had a starring role in the 1947 film “Miracle on 34th Street,” where a girl discovers the real Santa inside the store.Macy’s will be offering a free online experience on its&nbsp;website&nbsp;at the end of November, where families can play games, get a virtual tour of Santa’s workshop and take a selfie with Santa.“Moving to a virtual engagement will safely bring the magic of Santa Claus to children of all ages this year,” Macy’s said in a statement to The Associated Press.The pandemic has forced Macy’s to tweak other holiday traditions.In order to deter crowds, its annual&nbsp;Thanksgiving Day parade&nbsp;won’t go through its usual route through Manhattan. Instead, floats, performers and giant cartoon balloons and will be filmed for TV in front of the Herald Square store in New York.Macy’s also&nbsp;ditched&nbsp;a one-night firework spectacle on the Fourth of July, and held smaller unannounced firework shows to stop people from gathering to watch._____Follow Joseph Pisani at&nbsp;http://twitter.com/josephpisaniCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

The vast majority of our Private Bank and Wine clients with three-month loan deferrals resumed payments during the quarter with very few extension requests. We expect the additional runway provided by our deferral programs, PPP, follow-on investments and clients' efforts to conserve cash will enable the majority of our venture debt deferral clients to do the same. Nevertheless, we continue to monitor our portfolio vigilantly, in light of continued economic uncertainty, fading stimulus and expiring deferrals. While there is potential for some increase in NPLs we are cautiously optimistic based on stable performance to date, and we have strong levels of reserves to withstand changing market conditions.

Manning also had a number of weapons around him in that second season that Jones would love to have in 2020 after Saquon Barkley went down for the year with a torn ACL. Manning had Tiki Barber and Brandon Jacobs in the backfield, Plaxico Burress and Amani Toomer outside, and Jeremy Shockey at tight end. Those players would all likely be the top weapon if we ported them onto the 2020 Giants.
 So let's be careful about making judgments too early on Jones. Manning went 1-6 as a first-year starter (and his brother, Peyton, went 3-13). Jones needs weapons, and an offensive line, and likely just a bit more time to develop. The Giants will certainly be in the forefront of teams considering one of the top-three QBs in the 2021 NFL Draft, but Jones will still have half his rookie deal to prove himself.
 And while it's mostly a coincidence how similar Jones and Manning look, their games do mirror each other in a handful of ways. A non-athletic Manning hoisted the Lombardi Trophy twice. At least if you squint, maybe there's space in your dreams for an athletic Manning clone to reach those heights, too.
