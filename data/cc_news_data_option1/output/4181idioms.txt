PIGEON - The Bad Axe varsity football team clinched its first league championship since 1985 and improved its record to 4-1 on Friday night with a 27-6 road win over host Laker.      Hatchets head coach Kal Pokley heaped praised on his players after the game, describing them as "a special group of boys" who have bought in to the team philosophy of working together as brothers to achieve their goals.      "They continue to work hard, put in extra time and dedicate themselves to the team," Pokley said.      The Hatchets staked themselves to a lead with under four minutes to go in the second quarter on a Vincent Blackstock touchdown run. The Lakers would score less than two minutes later, but the Hatchets showed resiliency and continued to fight in the second half on their way to victory.      The game was marked by numerous fumbles by both teams, and Pokley said this was where his team showed its mettle by remaining focused and not giving up.      "I thought we kept our heads in it well," Pokley said. "We didn't seem to get rattled."      He gave a great deal of credit to the play of his offensive line, throwing effective blocks, clearing defenders out and getting up field. Pokley said Toby MacPhee, Jake MacPhee and Carson Affer were especially key to the Hatchets' victory on Friday night.      "I think that made the difference for us," he said.      Pokely described his defense as "stout" and gave them credit for not getting down on themselves after allowing a touchdown on the ensuing drive just after the Hatchets had taken the lead. After the game, he told all his players that they themselves were responsible for their success so far this season and to not lose sight of that fact.      "It was a special moment," Pokley said. "I was happy for them and proud to be a part of that team."      He added that Laker is always a tough opponent, and he knew the Hatchets would have to give everything they had to come out on top.      Pokley went out of his way to credit his team's former coaches and the families that have raised the young men who make up the Hatchets' roster, saying none of their success would be possible without them and their contributions.      "I'm proud of the Bad Axe community that put this in motion," he said.      Laker head coach Steve VerBurg said his team had some opportunities, but turnovers proved to be costly, and the hole his team found itself in was just too deep to overcome a strong performance by the Hatchets.      "Bad Axe played a great game," VerBurg said.      The Hatchets wrap up the regular season with a game at Ubly. The game kicks off at 7 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 23.      Next up for Laker is a game on the road at Tawas. That game also gets underway at 7 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 23.

Astrid is caught between a love for the mystical beliefs of her ancestors and a longing to see a new world; Kai is a man of God who desires the touch of a woman; and Gerhard is a talent manipulated by his employers. A novel infused with folklore could seem twee to a contemporary reader but, wisely, Mytting salts the narrative with the grit of valley life. Aided by Deborah Dawkins' fluid translation, it reads like a gruelling piece of oral history, full of fabulous events but also everyday tragedies." \- Christian House, Financial Times

 Liz Fulmer has attended Grandview since the she was a teenager. She now holds the job of associate pastor, and she completed studies at Lancaster Theological Seminary last May.
 “Pastor is a job title, but I’m not a clergy person because only clergy are ordained,” Fulmer said. “To hold the title as a nonclergy person is rare, but that was an intentional decision of the church.”
 As an openly gay person, she said the policy to prevent gay people from ordained ministry is personal.
 “People called to ministry have been taught they will never be able to serve in these capacities, but worse than that, gay people have been told you’re falling short of God’s love,” Fulmer said.

Economic recovery, police reform and marijuana legalization are three issues on which the candidates vying to represent Kansas House of Representatives District 53 differ.
   
 Jim Gartner, the Democratic incumbent, faces a challenge from Jeff Coen, a Republican, in the Nov. 3 general election for that House seat, which represents some west Topeka residents living between S.W. Gage Boulevard and S.W. Urish Road.
   
 Gartner and Coen each sat down with The Topeka Capital-Journal this month to discuss their stances on a number of issues. Those conversations can be found by searching "From The Newsroom: The Topeka Capital-Journal" wherever you listen to podcasts.
      
 Both candidates for the District 53 seat say budget shortfalls induced by the coronavirus pandemic have left Kansas in a difficult spot, but they disagree on the remedy.
   
 "We're in really a financial predicament now," Gartner said, "because pre- COVID we had about $900 million in the black. I mean, revenue was coming in pretty strong, and we had a surplus. Now, I think the prediction is we're going to be $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in the hole for 2021."
   
 Gartner said if the state doesn't receive additional monetary support from the federal government, the Kansas Legislature next session would need to look at reducing expenses and raising revenues.
   
 "It's going to have to be a combination of both," he said.
   
 Gartner said he is in favor of moving quickly on a bill that would implement a "compensating use tax," which is essentially a tax on internet sales.
   
 "We have debated that bill numerous times, and we have it on the shelf ready to go," Gartner said. "That's a $30-$40 million positive hit on revenues, so it's low-hanging fruit. We ought to go after it, and we ought to implement it."
   
 Gartner said potential legalization of medical marijuana and sports betting could also result in new tax income for the state. And he thinks legislators should reexamine the state tax code to see what other areas might generate revenue.
   
 Coen attributed the state's budget shortfalls to a failure by legislators in the spring to pass a budget that took COVID-19 into consideration.
      
 "They knew that the lockdowns were coming and that the tax receipts wouldn't be as high," he said.
   
 Coen said legislators will have to prioritize and make cuts next year.
   
 "Where that is I don't know," he added.
   
 When asked about how he would address budget shortfalls and spur revenue growth, Coen said the state has to open its economy.
   
 "I think more economic activity would bring in more revenue," he said. "We can't bring in more tax revenue until the lockdowns are lifted."
   
 The stay-at-home order issued earlier this year by Gov. Laura Kelly expired in early May and allowed local officials to implement or ease up on restrictions. Over the summer, many Kansas counties moved into Phase 3 of reopening, which allows all venues and establishments to operate. However, some county orders continue to restrict hours and capacity.
   
 "It seems like we're pretty locked down," Coen said.
   
 On the topic of policing and criminal justice reform, Coen pointed to his participation in a "Back the Blue" rally held in late August in downtown Topeka.
   
 "If any of your viewers or readers have been following my campaign this fall, you know that I back the blue and all our first responders," he said.
   
 Coen said defunding the police isn't in Topeka's best interest, and the only police reforms he would support are those "that would help keep our police safer," he said.
   
 Gartner said he sees policing and criminal justice reform as two separate issues.
   
 "I think on police reform, that's a local issue across the state for every city council or county government to deal with," Gartner said. "Now, on criminal justice reform -- that's an issue that we have a criminal justice committee made up of various folks, that makes recommendations to us every year. So I'm looking forward to what they come forward with this legislative session."
   
 Gartner said he doesn't think people should be incarcerated for minor drug offenses, and he is open to considering criminal justice reforms presented to the Legislature.
   
 As a veteran of the Marine Corps, Gartner said, he is supportive of legalizing medical marijuana.
   
 "There are a number of veterans that suffer with PTSD," he said. "I believe that would help some of my fellow veterans and a number of other folks that suffer from different ailments."
   
 But he said if legislators are going to debate legalization of medical marijuana, they might as well debate legalization of marijuana in general.
   
 Coen said both of those issues should be up to the state's citizens.
   
 "I don't necessarily support outright legalization," Coen said, "but I would support putting it on the ballot."
   
 On the topic of Medicaid expansion in Kansas, neither candidate is completely against it.
   
 Gartner said he has been supportive of Medicaid expansion since it was first presented to the state.
   
 "I just think it's something we need to do to try and get health care to 130,000 or 150,000 Kansans," he said.
   
 Coen said he isn't necessarily against expansion, but he would seek to streamline the state's current Medicaid system before enrolling more people in KanCare.
   
 "What I'd like to do is to fix the current system because it is broken," he said. "I don't think we can expand KanCare until that system's fixed."

Seaman High senior Tanner McNutt had all of the makings for a Friday night of screams, terror and fright.
   
 McNutt, president of the high school's International Thespian Society theater troupe, was putting the finishing touches for the group's haunted trail, hosted by the thespians in collaboration with the school's FFA chapter. He ran down the trail, handing out final stage directions to his "actors" as they prepared to frighten community members into the night.
   
 As he passed a Frankenstein's monster, screams started bellowing out behind him. The mid-October sunset made for a bloody, but quickly dimming, night sky, and a sudden drop in the air temperature put a chill into every crunching footstep on the graveled haunted trail.
   
 "As president, the other officers and I and our teachers have been doing our hardest to meet the guidelines, and make sure everyone is as safe as possible, but also that they have a good time and get their minds off of COVID a little bit," McNutt said.
   
 The groups had briefly discussed cancelling the haunted trail, which serves as a fundraiser for the groups, in light of COVID-19 restrictions. But Megan VanGordon, FFA chapter sponsor and the high school's agriculture teacher, said the groups were able to make sure "all of their ducks were in a row," and the groups' students and advisers crafted a plan that would allow them to continue with the fall tradition.
   
 The show would go on.
   
 There wasn't too much different about the haunted trail, now in its sixth year. A non-spooky, kid-friendly haunted trail with activities and prizes preceded the main event after sundown. The main difference was that groups were limited to six people, and minders along the trail would make sure people wore their masks remained socially distant.
   
 Once the child's play ended, dozens of students scarfed down dinner, donned makeup and costumes and set out for the trail, some to lie in wait in the brush and others at horror film scenery standing silently by for their unsuspecting "victims."
   
 McNutt, now in his fourth year participating in the haunted trail, said the haunted trail was just as much fun for the students as it was for the community members who pay for the experience. This year, the theme was horror films, and students reenacted scenes from "Frankenstein," "The Shining," and "It," among others.
   
 "It's just a chance for people to get into a horror setting," McNutt said. "I believe that horror movies are the hardest movies to act in, and trying to get into the role of a scary person takes a lot of prep. Giving them the opportunity to go out there and be scary, it's really helpful and it really helps them with that side of theater."
   
 Lee Schmidt, associate vice principal and activities director at the high school, said the haunted trail was a welcome event for the clubs, which haven't had a lot of opportunities for face-to-face events this year. While the pandemic has cancelled a lot of clubs' travel opportunities, that's also cut down on a lot of the need for clubs to fundraise in the first place, he said.
   
 "It's unfortunate for the students, but hopefully we'll get back to normal soon," he said.
   
 But by pressing on with seasonal staples like the haunted trail, the students said they hope community members are able to find some semblance of normalcy in one of the strangest school years on record.
   
 "We're all still a community," Patrick Biggs, a senior and president of the FFA chapter, said. "We're all still here for each other. There's still something here for the people in the Seaman area to be doing. It's just one big family."
   
 "Sometimes we don't hear a ton of screams, and that's okay," McNutt said. "Hopefully, people still have fun, and they can forget COVID a bit and come out and enjoy something we do every year."

Husband and wife Paul Yanko and Enid Williams make art work as a vocation and as a teaching career.
 They once took a graduate school adviser up on an offer to hire them to paint the interior of his house.
 Yanko said a certain degree of sacrifice enables them to be working artists.
 Setting and meeting deadlines helps the couple organize time and efforts. They freely share that advice with their students.
 The couple rented studio space in Ohio for eight years, straight out of graduate school.
 “We hosted exhibitions and got an opportunity to exhibit in the building we were renting,” Yanko said. “We were not waiting for any opportunity to come to us. ... We donated work, we volunteered our time and did everything we could to be a part of and support our community.”
 “It was a lot of fun,” Yanko said, of the house painting experience years ago. However, Yanko admits their determination to make art work as a career doesn’t allow room “to cultivate too many extra hobbies.”
 “We enjoy exchanging ideas on projects and talking shop on what works for each of us, and what we teach,” Yanko said. We share a studio at our home in Greenville. ... Both of us hail from families with backgrounds in education.”
 Examples of their recently completed contemporary works are on view through Nov. 11 at the Lander University Fine Art Gallery. It’s located in the Josephine B. Abney Cultural Center. Hours: 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday.
 The exhibit is titled “Perfectly Familiar/Unrecognizably Strange.”
 In it are several large-scale paintings and framed works on paper, one of which is on the October cover of Carolina Arts magazine.
 “I continue to find new ways of combining elements that surprise me,” Yanko said. “The basic shapes are among the first things we learn, along with colors. ... I derive some influence from things like construction sets and commercial signage. ... It’s a nod to a classroom setting my mother taught in that was really populated by bright and interesting objects.”
 Williams said her work in this show contains “a very familiar circular element” but color and layering can give works more than one interpretation.
 “All artists I know are trying to maintain their practices,” Williams explains. “But, I feel like the title of our show touches on what it’s like to be an artist right now. We are faced with so many unfamiliar circumstances, but we are continuing to work.”
 Summers, Williams said, afford the teacher couple time to “dig into new work” but they make a conscious effort to be in the studio year-round.
 Engaging with a painting, Williams said, is a physical experience.
 Many of Yanko’s Governor’s School students have gone on to attend Lander and study art. He and Enid have traveled with the Lander University art department twice on trips abroad.
 “Both of us got our start teaching at the college level in Ohio, out of graduate school,” Yanko said. “Now, my teaching cohort at the Governor’s School is 16 to 18 year-olds. I’m teaching painting, drawing and two- dimensional design. Enid teaches painting, drawing and two-dimensional design and does print-making in a rotation, when enrollment permits. She’s serving students who range in age from 18 to 75.”
 Williams encourages emerging artists to show their works at coffee shops and other locations.
 “It’s a way to get your work out there and organize it,” Williams said. “Very often, you get some kind of response to your work. That kind of validation, I encourage you to seek out, in as many venues as you can find.”

The Greater Topeka Partnership on Friday announced a program that would give small businesses in Shawnee County the chance to receive a $5,000 grant.
   
 According to a news release from Jensen Simons, the partnership's communications manager, small businesses in the county may participate in an educational opportunity and submit a continuity plan to the GTP -- and have the plan approved -- to become eligible for the $5,000 grant.
   
 Simons said the program is a way to educate local small businesses and aid in creating systems of prevention and recovery.
   
 "A business continuity plan is a document that outlines how the business will function during a disruption," said Glenda Washington, the GTP's chief equity and opportunity officer.
   
 To be eligible for the grant, businesses must register for and participate in an Oct. 27 workshop about business resources and how to craft a continuity plan. Business owners may register for that workshop online by visiting the Greater Topeka Partnership's website, topekapartnership.com, and clicking on the "Events" tab. There will also be a "Replay Zoominar" of the workshop on Nov. 5.
   
 "The goal of this plan is to allow business operations to continue to operate before, during and after a disaster -- a very timely topic to tackle given the current state of the world," Washington said. "This program will provide small businesses with the educational resources, as well as the confidence, that will allow them to not only prepare for the worst, but also plan for their recovery."
   
 Other grant eligibility requirements include:
   
 - Must have been in business for a minimum of one year
   
 - Must be a for-profit, privately held small business that operates in Shawnee County
   
 - Should have 50 employees or fewer
   
 - All city, state and federal taxes and liens must be up to date
   
 - Must not have received funds from federal programs such as the Small Business Administration's Economic Injury Disaster Loans or Paycheck Protection Program and used them for the same purpose
   
 - Must be able to demonstrate economic injury as a result of the pandemic
   
 - Must provide detailed information and bills and outline use of proceeds directly related to the economic injury caused by COVID-19

That tough-nosed play extends to Cutler, who was the Titans’ starting quarterback on their 2018 state championship team and the 2019 squad that lost in the quarterfinals. He was a backup on the 2017 team that won the state title in the first of two consecutive undefeated seasons.
 This year, the Titans are experiencing a big bounceback after a rare fourth- place finish in the conference standings last year, which added motivation for the seven returning starters on both offense and defense.
 If the Titans beat Victor next week and finish 7-0 in conference play, they can earn the top seed over undefeated Thompson Falls, which is 8-0 in conference games but didn’t play Flint Creek this year because of the schedule rotation.
 If both teams are undefeated without a head-to-head tiebreaker, the next tiebreaker is margin of victory against common opponents, up to 24 points per game, Mike Cutler said. After Friday’s win, Flint Creek has a 20-point edge, 144-124.
 “We met as a conference and didn’t want to penalize a team for having a ‘no contest’ because of COVID,” said Mike Cutler, whose team had its season opener against Plains called off because of a positive COVID case.
 The Titans have been on a roll since then, they’ve outscored teams 402-26 and have pitched four shutouts. They nearly had a fifth, but their backups gave up a 23-yard touchdown pass from Preston Smith to Brandon Leavens with 31.7 seconds remaining.
 That touchdown came a few plays after Flint Creek fumbled for the fourth time and lost a fumble for the third time. Three of the Titan’s fumbles, including two that were lost, came in the first quarter.
 “I’m proud of how my kids kept fighting and kept playing,” Darby coach J.P. McCrossin said of his 1-6 team. “We only have two players starting today who were starters at the beginning of the year. We’ve been decimated by injuries and have six kids out. So, I’m pretty dang proud of the freshmen, sophomores and juniors because we didn’t have any seniors on the field.”

The Titans, ranked No. 2 among 8-Man teams in the state, got contributions across the board as they picked up a much-needed win that moves them to 7-0, secures a top-two playoff seed out of the west and helps them move closer to closing in on the conference title and the No. 1 seed.
 “We’re far from a one-man team,” Flint Creek coach Mike Cutler said in regards to the team missing its star player, who was in the hospital for an undisclosed reason. “If anybody thinks that we’re a one-man team and we’re not good if one of our guys doesn’t play, that’s crazy. Our guys have the same competitiveness, same effort that they play with all the time.”
 Metesh scored touchdown runs of 5, 5 and 2 yards by running through would-be tacklers as the Titans raced out to a 22-0 halftime lead. Sophomore quarterback Andrew Tallon, who has played considerable time this year because Flint Creek has blown out teams and rested Kade Cutler, threw for a 68-yard touchdown to Ethan Parke and scrambled for a 39-yard score, both in the second half as Flint Creek built a 36-0 lead. He added three 2-point runs.
 The defense stepped up too without Kade Cutler, who has also been all-state on that side of the ball in the secondary. Metesh intercepted one pass and nearly picked off another, which he blamed on the rain making the ball slick. He, Parke, Cordell Langston and Tucker Weaver routinely made their way into the backfield for sacks or tackles for loss. Parke also recovered a bobbled punt.
 “We work a lot in practice, so we’re good to step in if somebody has to come out,” Metesh said. “I think we’re just a fun group of guys. We like to joke a lot. And we’re physical.”

The race was on Thursday evening as businesses, organizations and community members gathered to take part in a tricycle race in support of Breakthrough House, a nonprofit agency that helps individuals in their recovery from mental illness.
   
 The tricycle race, which was a competition among nine teams from Valeo, Washburn University, Aflac, BPM Insurance and Breakthrough House.
   
 The tricycle race winner, who received a trophy, was BPM Insurance.
   
 While the race brought many smiles, laughs and joy to people who came out, the true purpose of the event was to bridge a connection between the community and Breakthrough House.
   
 Katie Gibbons, Breakthrough's clubhouse director, said it is nice to feel connected to the community and celebrate together.
   
 "I think it's really great," said Theresa Douthart, Breakthrough's residential program manager. "Hopefully some of the teams didn't know a lot about Breakthrough House and this will help them learn more and be involved. It's not just people that normally support us."
   
 Money raised through donations and sponsorships during the tricycle race will go directly back to Breakthrough's many programs, including operating the clubhouse, payee program and residential services.
   
 According to Sheena Ward, Breakthrough's board president, the nonprofit didn't set a monetary goal for the event, and although the agency has recently received funding from various outlets, more is still needed.
   
 "Even with all of the funding that I mentioned before and all of those partnerships, we still fall short of doing the things that we would really like to do to serve the people that we do serve through our programs," Ward said.
   
 This is also the first event that Breakthrough House has been able to host this year. The nonprofit had to cancel earlier this year its annual golf tournament, which typically brings in over $10,000, because of COVID-19.
   
 "This event is not going to raise what we're accustomed to our revenue that we get through the golf tournament but it will be something," Ward said.

Autumn colors are taking over the landscape. Cool temperatures are dominating the weather. Farmers are in their fields. It is a great time, no, a perfect time, to get outdoors.
   
 With that, I have a lot on my mind this week. Let us talk about a few of those things.
   
 Out at the marsh on a very gloomy morning. Just sitting and watching. I catch a glimpse of a Northern Harrier that soon flies by me. It was hunting in typical Harrier fashion when it drops on the far side of the lake in some tall grasses. (Well, I call it a lake, but it was drained earlier in the summer. It is now though being filled again. Better late than never I guess).
   
 Just seconds after the harrier lands then up pops a Red-Tailed Hawk which must have been feeding in that very spot. Thus, began a five-minute chase, or torment, of the harrier on the hawk. They flew in circles with the harrier flying just behind the hawk. Diving in and out from time to time until the hawk landed in a nearby tree. The harrier then made a few swoops at the hawk until finally giving up.
   
 But the harrier then got a taste of her own medicine as another female harrier flew in and began to torment her. Doing much the same as the harrier/hawk conflict. This time the chase lasted nearly ten minutes ending only when the first harrier left the scene.
   
 What I have learned after studying chipmunks over the last few months. Chipmunks have an internal clock that must tell them that winter is coming and that they must store food. It is a never-ending task that will last all day and well into the evening. Chips will stay until nearly dark gathering food to store in a food chamber deep in their winter burrows. They seem to only stop when: a predator, like a Cooper's Hawk is present. If and when that happens, you may not see another chip the rest of the day. On warm mornings they are active not long after sunrise but if the day is rather cool you will not see one until later in the morning.
   
 If the day is very windy chips do not move along the downed tree, they prefer to stay and gather the seeds that are on the ground. And very seldom, this time of year, due to the urgency of the situation, do they stop and eat for a while. They will stay only long enough to fill their pouches, hurry back to their burrows, deposit their cache, and then quickly return to gather more seeds, only to repeat the same scenario over and over again.
   
 Again, at the marsh, I begin to think that it is about time for the arrival of White-Fronted Geese to our area. It was not long after that when I hear something high in the sky. I look up and there they were. Just a small flock, maybe
   
 150 White-Fronts in all. They fly on by but a few days later I find more out at the marsh. They have returned.
   
 More and more ducks have been arriving to our area. I did see several Pied- Billed Grebes (see photo) at Lakeland along with several Coots, Shovelers and even a few Ruddy Ducks It will only get better in the coming days.
   
 It was a few weeks ago, on a warm day, that I lay and spent some time with the Praying Mantis that you see here this week. I do not know much about them but when you look really close, they are a wild looking creature. You just gotta love those eyes.
   
 The deer have been coming up in the yard and eating acorns. I had always thought that deer will save the acorns for last, especially in late winter, when all other favorite food sources have dried up. I wonder how they can tolerate the tannins in the acorns. They have to be strong tasting. As humans we must soak out those tannins in order to make them edible. I guess the same goes for squirrels who compete for the acorns with the deer.
   
 I developed that nostalgic feeling along. I have been trying to find some of my old favorite outdoor shows on the internet. I have found a few like Jerry Mckinnis (my all time favorite), Flip Pallot, Virgil Ward and Harold Ensley. They were all great shows and I do not believe that there is a show out there today that can even compete. Sure, there are still a few good shows out there but nothing like these. The Fishin' Hole with Jerry Mckinnis for example. If I was going to miss the regular weekly show, I made sure I taped it to watch later. There is no show today that I would ever consider doing that with. Many times, if you can not find a show, you can find the opening theme and that itself is enough to bring back some great memories. I bet some of you could even recite the theme song to Virgil Ward, I am sure you can. If only we could bring them back.

 The Magpies must attack Man U because they are dreadfully vulnerable at the back. If Newcastle sit in and play on the counter attack people like Marcus Rashford and Mason Greenwood will slaughter them. They must take the game to Man U. Hit them where it hurts.
 Maguire may be football's costliest defender, captain of club and country, and David De Gea once hailed the world's best goalkeeper but right now they are both liabilities.
 When shots are hit at the Man U goal home attackers must fly in expecting rebounds.
 I also want to see Jonjo Shelvey in support of his forwards not his defenders. Play 20 yards further upfield because that is when he is at his best.

PEMBROKE -- Incumbent Josh Cutler will face off against Republican candidate Tatyana Semyrog for state representative of the 6th Plymouth District in the Nov. 3 general election.
 The 6th Plymouth District includes the towns of Pembroke, Duxbury and Hanson.
 Cutler, a 49-year-old Democrat, has held the seat for four terms. He co- sponsored the Energy Savings and Efficiency Act (Energy SAVE), and led the successful effort to restore weekend commuter rail service to the South Shore.
 "I'm running for re-election (because) I want to continue to use my experience to help solve problems and make sure that our district continues to be a great place to live, work, and raise a family," Cutler said.
 Looking toward a potential fifth term, Cutler said he is focused on renewable energy, climate change, economic development and education. He said he wants to focus on bringing local aid to his district, and previously helped pass the Student Opportunity Act, which will provide funding to school districts to address disparities in achievement.
 Cutler also said he is focused on supporting small businesses, especially in light of COVID-19.
 "We need to focus on our economic recovery and helping all businesses, but especially our small businesses that need help the most," Cutler said.
 Semyrog did not respond to email, phone or social media attempts to contact her for this story, but did participate Monday in a candidate forum hosted by radio station WATD.
 In the forum, Semyrog touched on oppression she experienced in her birth country, the former Soviet Union, and said she now sees similar behavior in the United States with the "labeling, bullying, debasing, marginalizing, and ostracizing" of people who do not agree with "the left."
 Cutler said the role of a state representative is three-fold, but most importantly it requires one to provide constituent service. He said that is especially important because of the pandemic as people navigate unemployment and financial assistance for their small businesses. The other two roles, he said, are fighting for the district's share of state resources and being a leader on issues of importance to the district as well as the state.
 "I think I have a track record I think of getting things done, of being a voice for my district, I mean I can give you a litany of examples," Cutler said. "I'm comfortable [with] people judging me on my record and I hope that they will and I think if they look at that they'll see that I've done a fair job and I work hard and I've been an effective voice for our district."
 Semyrog said that her name has been "dragged through the mud and smeared," and that she has not received an apology from Cutler for what Semyrog says are attacks on her heritage, past, and character.
 "I am running to stand up against this oppression, to give people hope and courage," Semyrog said during the WATD candidates forum. "Our freedoms are under attack by the kind of socialist agenda my opponent has been voting for. His votes to defund our police, increase our gas tax, all while voting twice to increase his pay speak of a radical leftist who has no businesses representing this district."
 In response, Cutler said that he supports policing reform, such as the licensing and certification of police officers, but does not support "defunding the police," which refers to the reallocation of funds from police departments to other priority areas. Additionally, he said that the gas tax has decreased by 40% since he took office, although he did vote in support of the March tax bill.
 Semyrog was recently criticized on social media over comments she appears to have made under her maiden name on the blog shoebat.com. The comments, which are now deleted, addressed the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting.
 She responded to the attacks with a post on her personal blog, where she said she is not able to recall much of the time period during which those comments were made due to her cancer diagnosis and death of her husband.
 "I don't recognize any of those words as ever have been written by me because I simply have no memory of such," Semyrog wrote in the blog post.
 Cutler currently resides in Pembroke with his wife and two children.
 Semyrog is a resident of Duxbury where she lives with her three children.
 Voters in Massachusetts have until Oct. 24 to register to vote in the Nov. 3 primary and until Oct. 28 to request a mail-in ballot. Early voting will take place from Oct. 17 to Oct. 30.

WATERLOO — Right from the start it was clear what Waterloo’s game plan was heading into Friday night’s clash with Pardeeville — to run the football — and run it did.
 The Pirates, led by junior Eugene Wolff, racked up 246 yards on the ground in a 35-26 Eastern Suburban Conference home win.
 “We changed some things up in terms of some formational stuff and the kids really bought into it during the week,” said Waterloo head coach Dave Frisell. “Their mentality is let’s try to be physically dominant and see if we can kill their will.”
 Wolff had a career night, gaining 159 yards on 23 carries while scoring the Pirates’ first three touchdowns on short runs.
 “Eugene is a special football player and I told him I think he has an incredible future ahead of him; the things he’s done from last year to this year to improve himself is one of the biggest jumps I’ve ever seen. If he does that again next year between his junior and senior season, I think we’ll have a few scouts watching him,” said Frisell.
 Wolff got the ball five straight times before breaking into the end zone on the game’s opening drive, and Francisco Moreno’s point-after kick gave Waterloo (2-1 overall, 2-0 ESC) a quick 7-0 lead.
 “After that first drive, the kids were pretty excited,” added Frisell.
 Senior Jackson Christenson’s blocked punt set up Waterloo’s second TD, a 1-yard Wolff plunge, giving the Pirates a 14-0 advantage with six minutes remaining in the first quarter.
 Wolff’s third score capped off an impressive 11-play, 65-yard drive in the second quarter and gave Waterloo a 21-6 halftime lead.
 The Bulldogs (0-2, 0-2), playing their first game since Week 1 after experiencing COVID cases within the athletic program, scored on the opening drive of the second half when senior quarterback Peter Freye hit senior running back Ty Westbury with a 12-yard touchdown pass. It cut the Pirate lead to 21-12.
 But Waterloo answered, and answered quickly. Facing a 2nd-and-5 from the Pardeeville 43-yard line, senior quarterback Black Huebner hit Christenson in stride and the senior took it to the house. Moreno’s PAT gave Waterloo a 28-12 advantage.
 “That was nice for Blake. He’s still getting his feet wet and trying to figure out this quarterback stuff, but it was really nice to see him put that ball right on the money,” Frisell said. “We needed it.”
 Huebner added a 10-yard scoring run with 8:20 remaining to cap off the Waterloo scoring.

In the letter supporting the motion for a permanent order of detention, federal prosecutors accuse Cienfuegos Zepeda of using his position to ensure that military operations were not conducted against the H-2 cartel, initiate operations against rivals, locate maritime transportation for drug shipments, help expand the territory controlled by the cartel and introduce senior cartel leaders to other corrupt Mexican government officials.
 The general also warned the cartel about US law enforcement investigations and informants, prosecutors wrote. In one instance, an H-2 cartel member whom the organization incorrectly believed to be an informant was murdered, according to the letter.
 The evidence against the general includes "thousands of Blackberry Messenger communications" between him and a senior cartel boss as well as other organization members, according to the letter.
 Cienfuegos Zepeda's detention comes less than a year after the US arrest of Mexico's former public security secretary, Genaro Garcia Luna, who held the post from 2006 to 2012.
 Garcia Luna, who was arrested by federal agents in Dallas, Texas, last December, was charged in a drug trafficking conspiracy that involved receiving millions of dollars in bribes from imprisoned drug cartel kingpin Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, according to federal prosecutors. Garcia Luna has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
 AMLO on Friday defended the armed forces, calling them "incorruptible" and "pillars of the Mexican state" while blaming former administrations of what he called the "neoliberal period" when tens of thousands of Mexicans were killed in drug-related violence and cartel warfare.
 In May, AMLO ordered the armed forces to return to the streets in an attempt to reduce violence by primarily targeting organized criminal groups. The move was controversial because he won the presidency on a platform of demilitarizing the country's long-running war against drug cartels.
 Previous administrations also deployed the military against the cartels. The resulting violence has left hundreds of thousands of dead in Mexico since 2006.
  _CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misspelled the name of the former defense minister General Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda._

Singapura impõe o uso da sua aplicação de rastreio, 'Tracetogether', a trabalhadores migrantes que considera estarem em situações de risco elevado, como os do setor da construção que partilham dormitórios comunitários ou os que trabalham nos portos.
 No Qatar, a aplicação 'Ehteraz' é obrigatória para quem queira andar na rua e quem se recuse instalá-la pode ser multado ou ficar sujeito a três anos de prisão.
 Na Índia, um dos países com mais infetados, desde maio que é obrigatório para todos os trabalhadores dos setores público e privado ou para as pessoas em zonas sob confinamento instalar a aplicação 'Aarogya Setu', sob pena de multas ou penas de prisão que podem ir até dois anos.
 A Comissão Nacional de Proteção de Dados alertou na quarta-feira que o uso obrigatório da 'StayAway Covid' "suscita graves questões relativas à privacidade dos cidadãos" e a Associação D3 já disse que admitia avançar com uma providência cautelar para travar a obrigatoriedade de instalar a aplicação, dizendo que "as Apps obrigatórias não pertencem a uma Europa democrática".
 Bloco de Esquerda, PCP, CDS-PP, PAN, Verdes e Chega já se manifestaram contra a obrigatoriedade do uso da aplicação, enquanto o líder do PSD, Rui Rio, manifestou dúvidas em relação à eficácia de tal medida, remetendo a sua análise para a apreciação em comissão parlamentar.

As a county commissioner in Grays Harbor, I have had the privilege of serving with Edna for many years, even before she was a commissioner. I know of no other local elected official that truly serves the public like Edna. She’s seen out and about everywhere in Lewis County — she is that involved. Edna loves people, enjoys serving her community and working for Lewis County. It is for these reasons and many others, I offer my deepest support to Commissioner Edna Fund in her re-election bid for Lewis County Commissioner, District 1.
 During the past several years, Edna and I have worked side-by-side to make things better for our counties. We serve together on the Chehalis River Basin Flood Authority and the state’s Chehalis Basin Board working to protect people, property, businesses and our environment. We meet multiple times per month and Edna is an effective leader in her role to work to reduce flooding and mitigate flood damage. Edna has met year after year with our legislative representatives, ensuring the people in the Chehalis Basin are heard and their needs are addressed.
 Edna and I have been part of a five-county behavioral health organization since its inception in 2016. Behavioral health issues in our region are extremely challenging, yet Edna continues to address the needs of her constituents with compassion, knowledge and respect. As we continue to try to do more with limited resources, Edna remains steadfast in her desire to assist those with mental illness and in vulnerable circumstances.

 Autumn colors are taking over the landscape. Cool temperatures are dominating the weather. Farmers are in their fields. It is a great time, no, a perfect time, to get outdoors.
 With that, I have a lot on my mind this week. Let us talk about a few of those things.
 Out at the marsh on a very gloomy morning. Just sitting and watching. I catch a glimpse of a Northern Harrier that soon flies by me. It was hunting in typical Harrier fashion when it drops on the far side of the lake in some tall grasses. (Well, I call it a lake, but it was drained earlier in the summer. It is now though being filled again. Better late than never I guess).
 Just seconds after the harrier lands then up pops a Red-Tailed Hawk which must have been feeding in that very spot. Thus, began a five-minute chase, or torment, of the harrier on the hawk. They flew in circles with the harrier flying just behind the hawk. Diving in and out from time to time until the hawk landed in a nearby tree. The harrier then made a few swoops at the hawk until finally giving up.
 But the harrier then got a taste of her own medicine as another female harrier flew in and began to torment her. Doing much the same as the harrier/hawk conflict. This time the chase lasted nearly ten minutes ending only when the first harrier left the scene.
 What I have learned after studying chipmunks over the last few months. Chipmunks have an internal clock that must tell them that winter is coming and that they must store food. It is a never-ending task that will last all day and well into the evening. Chips will stay until nearly dark gathering food to store in a food chamber deep in their winter burrows. They seem to only stop when: a predator, like a Cooper's Hawk is present. If and when that happens, you may not see another chip the rest of the day. On warm mornings they are active not long after sunrise but if the day is rather cool you will not see one until later in the morning.
 If the day is very windy chips do not move along the downed tree, they prefer to stay and gather the seeds that are on the ground. And very seldom, this time of year, due to the urgency of the situation, do they stop and eat for a while. They will stay only long enough to fill their pouches, hurry back to their burrows, deposit their cache, and then quickly return to gather more seeds, only to repeat the same scenario over and over again.
 Again, at the marsh, I begin to think that it is about time for the arrival of White-Fronted Geese to our area. It was not long after that when I hear something high in the sky. I look up and there they were. Just a small flock, maybe
 150 White-Fronts in all. They fly on by but a few days later I find more out at the marsh. They have returned.
 More and more ducks have been arriving to our area. I did see several Pied- Billed Grebes (see photo) at Lakeland along with several Coots, Shovelers and even a few Ruddy Ducks It will only get better in the coming days.
 It was a few weeks ago, on a warm day, that I lay and spent some time with the Praying Mantis that you see here this week. I do not know much about them but when you look really close, they are a wild looking creature. You just gotta love those eyes.
 The deer have been coming up in the yard and eating acorns. I had always thought that deer will save the acorns for last, especially in late winter, when all other favorite food sources have dried up. I wonder how they can tolerate the tannins in the acorns. They have to be strong tasting. As humans we must soak out those tannins in order to make them edible. I guess the same goes for squirrels who compete for the acorns with the deer.
 I developed that nostalgic feeling along. I have been trying to find some of my old favorite outdoor shows on the internet. I have found a few like Jerry Mckinnis (my all time favorite), Flip Pallot, Virgil Ward and Harold Ensley. They were all great shows and I do not believe that there is a show out there today that can even compete. Sure, there are still a few good shows out there but nothing like these. The Fishin' Hole with Jerry Mckinnis for example. If I was going to miss the regular weekly show, I made sure I taped it to watch later. There is no show today that I would ever consider doing that with. Many times, if you can not find a show, you can find the opening theme and that itself is enough to bring back some great memories. I bet some of you could even recite the theme song to Virgil Ward, I am sure you can. If only we could bring them back.

Regardless of the kind of change or the reason behind it, it has been universally accepted that change is uncomfortable, hence the minuscule percentage of people who welcome it with open arms. Relocating most times connotes starting afresh, and as attractive as it might sound, can be a difficult experience. While it may take some people a few months or years to find their bearing, others never truly integrate into their new environment. Fortunately, the former was the case for Ify Adenuga, a young Nigerian igbo lady who, as a result of the Nigerian Civil War that occurred in the late 60’s, was forced to leave her family, friends and everything she knew.

“The health care insurance industry is complicated, but it should be easy,” Diaz said. “For the state, we have the power to get basic health care where people can go to the doctors and afford that minimum out-of-pocket expense instead of paying thousands of dollars.”
 During his first term in the Senate, Martin supported bipartisan legislation to reduce prescription drug costs to residents by eliminating the state’s “generic medicine gag rule.” This rule had required pharmacists not to tell a patient whether it would be cheaper to pay out of pocket than use insurance or switch to generic drugs.

In the second half, the Panthers seemed to realize how precious each possession was and didn’t squander their opportunities.
 Rubi Trejo ripped off a 36-yard run as part of a 4-play drive that was capped off by Carson Hawker executing a beautiful jump cut to elude oncoming Beavers on his way to a 16-yard touchdown scamper to put the Panthers on the board and open the proverbial floodgates.
 After forcing another American Falls turnover on downs, Snake River scored on the first play of the next possession on one of just three passes thrown by Gilbert all game, as Gilbert hit Trey Poulter in stride on a short slant. Poulter hit the afterburners and galloped 61 yards untouched for the second score of the game.
 American Falls' run-dominant wing-T offense struggled to mount much of a comeback against Snake River once the Panthers gained the lead, and a 44-yard touchdown run by Trejo in the fourth quarter was the icing on the cake for Snake River.
 The Panthers (3-4, 2-0) will wrap up the regular season next week in Preston as they take on the Indians at 7 p.m. American Falls (2-5, 0-1) plays at Marsh Valley.

Here's a simplified version of how "David Byrne's American Utopia" made its way from album to stage to film. Byrne, the former Talking Heads front man, released his solo album "American Utopia" in 2018. He went on tour, with a band, to promote it. At some point during the tour, he got to thinking about the 1984 Talking Heads concert film "Stop Making Sense," which evolved from the band's 1983 tour to promote the album "Speaking in Tongues." Byrne got the idea that maybe "American Utopia" would also work as a film. So, he developed the concert show into a stage show, brought it on the road to work out the kinks and get it ready for a run on Broadway, and contacted Spike Lee about directing a film of it.
 Now, the combined creative vision of Byrne and Lee comes to television, premiering on Oct. 17 on HBO.
 Whether or not you're a David Byrne/Talking Heads afficionado is irrelevant, as the film of the concert-stage presentation is an inspired and entertaining production. It's a non-stop performance, consisting mostly of Byrne's catchy, often idiosyncratic pop music. It's not, by any means, a collection of Talking Heads greatest hits. Some of them are in the almost two-hour set ("Once in a Lifetime," "Burning Down the House," "Road to Nowhere"), but there are also lesser known tunes from the Heads catalogue, a few from Byrne's solo career - right up through "American Utopia" - and a couple of covers.
 Lee had seen the show a couple of times when it was being shaped on the road, and attended many more of them on Broadway, so when he brought in his cameras near the end of its run last February, he knew exactly where to place them, including on the ceiling, right above the stage.
 Byrne opens the proceedings by his lonesome, seated at a table, holding a plastic model brain, singing "Here," the final track on the "American Utopia" album. Soon, he's joined by two other performers, both of them singers, both of them, like Byrne, dressed in gray suits, and barefoot. The set list is off and running, with "I Know Sometimes a Man Is Wrong" from Byrne's "Rei Momo" album.
 More performers, gray-suited and barefoot, join them onstage. Some of them sing, others play instruments, many do both; all of them are involved in various forms of choreography, be it dancing, swaying, or marching.
 Something they all have in common is that they're in no way attached to anything. There are no cords plugged into instruments, nor are there any amplifiers to be seen. Everything - vocal microphones included - is radio- controlled. Every performer is completely unencumbered, able to freely move around the stage ... and on and off the stage, regularly passing back and forth through the beaded curtains on three sides of it.
 There's another song featuring Byrne alone, sometimes he's playing a guitar, sometimes he's instrument-free. Then he's again joined by all those other singers and players. The lighting and stage design is kept simple. The aural design ranges from percussive, full-band accompaniment to Byrne addressing the audience with amiable chatter, speaking about a song he just did or is about to do, throwing in some of his own musical history or a few choice socio- political comments. He's a gracious host.
 The songs keep on coming: "Don't Worry About the Government," "Everybody's Coming to My House," "Every Day Is a Miracle." Most are upbeat and positive. One is sad. A couple can fairly be called angry. (Byrne's cover of Janelle Monae's "Hell You Talmbout" is filled with rage.)
 Spike Lee keeps things moving with lots of cameras and lots of angles, but Byrne and his music and musicians are the stars of the show. His closer, "One Fine Day," from his Brian Eno collaboration album "Everything That Happens Will Happen Today," with its glorious, harmony-filled a cappella singing, is a perfect way to end. That is, until everyone roars into the joyous encore of "Road to Nowhere."
 "David Byrne's American Utopia" premieres on HBO on Oct. 17 at 8 p.m.

Restrictions meant to slow the spread of COVID-19 have made it a struggle for many Lancaster County restaurants to remain viable, let alone make any money.
 Since the March 17 order from Gov. Tom Wolf that originally forced them to close, restaurant operations have been closely regulated, with rules detailing how tables need to be arranged, what kind of menus can be used, and how customers should be served ketchup and mustard.
 Last month, Wolf relaxed an onerous rule limiting restaurants to only using 25% of their indoor seating capacity. Now, by doing a self-certification, that seating capacity can be boosted to 50%.

Coming into something where you have three coaches, or coach after coach after coach, it’s just the nature of the business and I was taught that my freshman year.

I’m sorry, but when I see an individual driving alone in their automobile with a mask on, I am inclined to shake my head in disbelief. And when I see a college football coach, his face covered, running up and down the sidelines, I cannot help but be amused. It gets worse. At the end of the game, the coach, with mask on, steps up to a microphone in the middle of the field; while the sports reporter stands, not 6 feet, but 10 yards away in full mask conducting the interview. And how about these news reporters who, in quarantine at home, wear a mask while reporting?
 I have also noticed that people who wear masks have less tendency to make eye contact. It’s like “if I look at you I might get the virus.” Heaven help us.
 Which brings me to the subject of smiles.
 All this masking has contributed to eliminating the human smile from our culture. I find it utterly depressing.
 Recently, I can across the following take on the importance of smiles. The author remains anonymous.
 “A smile costs nothing, but gives much. It enriches those who receive, without making poorer those who give. It takes but a moment, but the memory sometimes lasts forever. None is so rich or mighty that he can get along without it, none is so poor but that he can be made rich by it. A smile creates happiness in a home, fosters goodwill in business, and is the countersign of friendship. It brings rest to the weary, cheer to the discouraged, sunshine to the sad, and it is nature’s best antidote for trouble. Yet it cannot be bought, begged, borrowed, or stolen, for it is something that is of no value to anyone until it is given away. Some people are too tired to give a smile. Give them one of yours, as none needs a smile so much as he who has no more to give.”
 A songwriter once coined the phrase, “the sunshine of your smile.” The next time you see someone whose eyes are downcast and they seem to be “down and out,” back up 6 feet, drop your mask, and flash your “pearly whites.” This world can use all the sunshine it can get.

FALL RIVER - Town nurse Emily Lachance has been administering the flu shot at several drive-thru flu clinics in Swansea and Somerset over the past month. While in Fall River, Tess Curran, director of Health and Human Services is advising residents to see their primary care physicians or visit a flu shot clinic at a local pharmacy or store.
 No matter where, the message this season is clear: Get a flu shot.
 In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the flu shot is more important than ever, said Curran. While she always encourages everyone over age 6 months to get the flu shot, this year it's of even more significance because COVID can mirror some of the symptoms of the flu, she said.
 "People sometimes belittle the flu, but the flu kills people every year, so it's really important every year to get the flu shot but this year it's critical," added Curran.
 Fall River hasn't held flu shot clinics in years because there's so many other ways to access flu shots in the community and most types of insurance cover the cost them, said Curran.
 The flu season runs from October to May, but Curran is encouraging everyone to get the shot as soon as possible. The precautions people are urged to use to prevent the spread of COVID-19, such as washing hands, wearing masking and avoiding any unnecessary contact outside the home, will also help with limiting the spread of the flu, added Curran.
 In Somerset and Swansea, Lachance will administer 1,300 flu shots over this season. She has already administered 650 flu shots in three clinics and she has another 650 shots available to administer at upcoming flu shot clinics and in her office by appointment. Lachance ordered the shots last spring through her supplier, but she was told they were out of shots now so once the remaining 650 are used up that will be the end of her supply for this season. The next ones will be Oct. 17 and 24. Check the Swansea website to make an appointment.
 She said the huge demand for the flu shot has resulted in delays in shipping, at least from one of the bigger companies. "I did have a few weeks where I had nothing," said Lachance. "I would not be surprised if I run out entirely this year."
 LaChance said she also does in-house clinics in the schools in both towns' schools with the assistance of the Swansea school nurses.
 Somerset Fire Chief Jamison Barros said the Somerset Fire Department has been able to help Lachance with administering the flu shots at the drive-thru flu clinics as a result of the Community EMS Program. Through that program, 33 members of the fire department have been trained to administer vaccines, which will also apply to a vaccine for COVID-19, when its available, he said.
 "Somerset Fire has been and will be a huge help," said Lachance.

Research shows the benefits of cooking school meals from scratch using fresh, unprocessed ingredients. Not only do childhood obesity rates decrease among students with access to healthy food at school, but their measurable academic performance improves as well. Scratch cooking is also a financially sustainable food service model for districts; since they can set their own recipes, scratch-cook programs have more control over the cost of their ingredients than if they were to purchase pre-processed items from a food supplier. The ability to purchase whole ingredients locally also contributes to the local food economy and a more environmentally sustainable way of preparing food in schools.

I, like most of you, have given this COVID-19 pandemic a lot of thought. Please understand, I fully grasp the seriousness of its impact. Early in the outbreak I lost a friend who was as fine a man as I have ever known. A few months later, one of my younger brothers had a frightening close call with the virus. Since then, others I had known have passed away.
 Over the course of many months I have observed this virus to be most virulent when numbers of people occupy a confined space over an extended period of time. Even Dr. Fauci admitted early on that it was hard to contract a “hot” dose of the virus by casual contact.
 Which brings me to the subject of masks. I have two nurses in my family, and I have had the privilege of being closely connected with the healthcare industry over many years. So I understand and appreciate the need to mask up. But I have concerns about the long- term consequences of all this mask wearing.

With the arrival of fall rains, the wildfire season is, fortunately, over for Western Washington, but we won’t soon forget the week of unhealthy air, the desperate evacuations of people and livestock or the sight of blackened acres in our region. Now would be a good time to evaluate the landscaping around your home to determine how you can keep a wildfire at a safe distance.
 Clear a 5-foot area immediately around your house of flammable or dead plants, wood mulch and firewood. Incorporate fire-resistant plants that will not easily ignite or add fuel to the fire. Fire-resistant plants are moist and supple with watery sap and no dead wood or material. Well-watered annuals, perennials, groundcovers, broadleaf evergreens, deciduous shrubs and turf fall into this category. A green, well-maintained lawn mowed to a height of 4 inches can act as a fuel break. Instead of a wood mulch, consider decorative rock or gravel, or incorporate rock into your bark mulch.
 Avoid planting highly flammable plants close to your home. Aromatic leaves are a warning sign. Juniper and Eucalyptus are two examples that should be kept at a safe distance, as they will fuel the fire. In general, trees with needles (think aromatic) are more flammable than deciduous trees. However, Western Larch and Ponderosa Pine are the safest conifers due to their thick bark and high moisture content.

FOOD FOR THOUGHT: Winterize your pantry with these staples


--DocBreak--
DuBOIS — Sitting inside Aegis Coffee Roasters in downtown DuBois one afternoon, 2-year-old Remy Pastorius walked up to the colorful upright piano on display against the wall.
 And even though she may not have been old enough to read the words painted in black on the front of the piano that say, “Play Me,” Pastorius gently started tapping on the ivory keys while her parents were placing their order at the counter just a few steps away.
 A couple of tables over, DuBois Area Middle School music teacher Joe Sensor and his daughter, Maddie Sensor, a senior at the DuBois Area High School, were delighted to see the old piano being used after they worked together to restore it and then donated it to the nonprofit organization, Downtown DuBois Inc.
 Several years ago, Joe Sensor started tuning and repairing pianos because there are not many people who offer that service anymore.
 “I would sometimes be playing the piano and have a couple of bad notes on the piano, and I was like, ‘Maybe I could fix that,’ so I just started working on my own first,” said Joe Sensor. He eventually started tuning and repairing pianos as a hobby and started a Facebook group called Piano Rescue.
 Every now and then, people contact him because they are trying to get rid of their upright piano.
 “With this one, I said I would help them find a new home for it,” said Joe Sensor. “And they were moving at the end of July, and I said, ‘Well, if I don’t find a home for it, I’ll take it, put it in my garage.’”
 And so, he did exactly that.
 “I had it (piano) advertised on Facebook and nobody really was biting, which is kind of common because there’s a lot out there on Facebook,” said Joe Sensor.
 With no takers on social media, Joe Sensor came up with the idea to contact the Downtown DuBois group to see if they possibly had a place for it.
 A couple of weeks later, Downtown DuBois got back to Joe Sensor and told him they could place it in Aegis, just outside their office doors of the North Central Pennsylvania LaunchBox, powered by Penn State DuBois, at 2 E. Long Ave., in downtown DuBois. When the weather is nice, Joe Sensor said the piano could be taken outside for people to enjoy as well, like it was during the recent Octoberfest held in the downtown.
 Shortly after that, Joe Sensor disassembled the piano, sanded and primed it so the paint would stick.
 “I did a little bit of work on the inside of it. There were a couple keys that were broken and things like that,” said Joe Sensor.
 Maddie Sensor then took over by designing the color scheme of the previously brown-colored piano and brightening it up by painting it red, blue, yellow and black.
 “I just wanted to make it all primary colors so that it would stand out and people could see it from a distance,” said Maddie Sensor. “It was about 15 hours of painting altogether. The original plan was to make it look like the Partridge Family bus, like that kind of geometric with all the colors. And then I just decided I was going to paint each part the solid color and then do a black design.”
 Maddie Sensor admits she’s not very instrumental but is more of an artist.
 “I like singing and I’m a Color Guard in the high school marching band,” said Maddie Sensor, noting that she is considering going to the Rhode Island Institute of Art after graduation.
 “I like illustration and art for children’s books,” she said.
 Though this is the first upright piano Joe Sensor has “up-cycled,” he has another one in his garage needing some care.
 “I can only fit one at a time in my garage. I don’t know if I have a definite home for it yet,” said Joe Sensor. “I mean, it was an idea I’ve seen other places where they do this, so I kind of thought it would make it a little more likely to find a home for it. These days, I think there’s a lot of these old pianos around, so I think we’re trying to make it a little bit more exciting ... encourage people ... try to make it friendly, I guess.”
 If people can’t find new homes for the older pianos, they just decide to toss it in a dumpster, he said.
 “I’m just trying to find homes for these pianos because I feel bad that ... well first of all, generally they can be pretty decent instruments still,” Joe Sensor said. “They just need a little bit of repair. But these days, most people would much rather have an electronic keyboard in the house, which is fine. I get it. I like playing electronic keyboards, too, but there’s something about the actual physical piano that’s nice.”
 “As a music teacher, I like the idea of demystifying music, maybe a little bit?” said Joe Sensor. “And also making it something that people can do in public too — have fun with it.”
 Every now and then, Joe Sensor also envisions putting some sheet music on the piano, something easy for people to try to play.
 “It’s just cool to see the piano being used,” said Joe Sensor. “I’d rather see them in use instead of sitting in somebody’s dusty living room. I think that’s kind of the ultimate thing.”
 If anyone has a piano they are looking to get rid of, or would be interested in one for business or public space, they can contact Joe Sensor at joe.sensor@gmail.com.

"We do have a few clinical trials currently going on, mainly in South Africa ... The AstraZeneca trial started a couple of weeks ago. We have a Novavax vaccine that also started in South Africa and, most recently, the Johnson&Johnson vaccine that also started in South Africa. Other countries have also been approached - Kenya, Uganda - but clinical trials have not yet started there," Dr. Mihigo said.   Johnson&Johnson on Tuesday announced that clinical trials of their candidate vaccine against COVID-19 would be paused after one patient exhibited symptoms of an "unexplained" illness.   AstraZeneca, which is producing its candidate vaccine in conjunction with the UK's University of Oxford, was also forced to temporarily suspend its trials in early September after adverse side effects were seen in one patient.   Kirill Dmitriev, the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), has said that Russian vaccines against COVID-19, which are based on the well- researched human adenovirus platform, may prove safer than using Western vaccines that are based on a chimpanzee adenovirus.   The RDIF is producing the Sputnik V vaccine in conjunction with its developer, the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology. (ANI/Sputnik)

 Here are two examples of how a governor appointment approach to industry oversight has recently failed here in NM:
 1) In 2019, the NM government passed the Produced Water Act, which allows for radioactive and chemical laden “produced water” (fracking wastewater), to be used outside of the industry, potentially even upon on agricultural lands. Usage outside of the industry will be regulated by the New Mexico Environment Dept. (NMED). (The bill was sponsored by Brian Egolf and Nathan Small on behalf of Marathon Oil, the author of the law.)

A Black Lives Matter mural in North Topeka is being taken down "within the week" as some consider the painting "vandalism," while others are frustrated and upset about the decision to wash it away. Organizers are already preparing for another mural to take its place.
   
 Ariane Davis lives in Topeka and cried when she heard the mural in NOTO was being removed. She said removing that message was like trying to erase Black voices from history. She said the painting, which stretches across a parking lot in NOTO, was not bothering anyone.
   
 County Commissioner Bill Riphahn said the recently passed "Home Rule" resolution allows the county to remove any unauthorized signage or paintings from county property.
   
 "We just can't allow anybody to paint anytime in a park or anything. If we allow that to stay, what is to keep another group from coming in and painting something bigger or over the top of it that might be offensive to another group?" Riphahn said. "Where does it end?"
   
 He added organizers can ask to get a new, county-approved mural.
   
 The mural was painted in June, but Riphahn says it was not grandfathered into the legislation. He said the Parks and Recreation department is taking it down.
   
 Davis said there is nothing that can be done to save the current painting, and is focusing on creating a new one.
   
 "It's not just going to be a small little piece in a parking lot," Davis said. "We want to be loud, we want to be proud, we want it bigger, we want it brighter, we want it bolder, we want to make a beautiful piece of work saying Black Lives Matter."
   
 Davis said she is in the early stages of planning the mural and wants community feedback, so the art is not the product of one or two people, but a representation of the community as a whole. She is working to get the mural approved to prevent any future artwork from being taken down by the county.
   
 In a post circulating on Facebook, some members of the "Blue Shield" Facebook group started a campaign to get the mural removed.
   
 Screenshots of the message showed one of the group administrators of Blue Shield suggesting "talking points" to its members, recommending what they should say to county officials in a letter-writing campaign.
   
 Davis said she was upset to see so many people writing and calling county commissioners to remove the message of unity.
   
 Davis said if everyone in the community were to sit down and talk with each other, they would see they have more in common than everyone realizes. She said people on social media have portrayed her as "the big bad wolf," when she said she is just a mother trying to bring peace and love to Topeka.
   
 "You can remove it from the street, you can remove it from signs, posters, buildings or anything else, but you have to understand that this is a movement," Davis said. "It is a way of life, and we will continue to call for justice and equality until every Black life matters."

In this college football season of fluid schedules -- when business as usual was contracts inked several years in advance -- Georgia Southern's short- notice agreement with UMass is different from the norm.
   
 The contract for the game at 4 p.m. Saturday at Paulson Stadium in Statesboro will pay $60,000 to the visiting team, the UMass Minutemen. The agreement was worked on Oct. 7 and signed that day by UMass athletic director Ryan Bamford, and signed the next day by Georgia Southern athletic director Jared Benko.
   
 Georgia Southern had announced Oct. 7 that its scheduled home game Oct. 14 against Appalachian State was postponed until Dec. 12 because of COVID-19 issues in the Mountaineers' program. Rather than go three weeks between games Oct. 3 and Oct. 24, Benko made a deal with Bamford.
   
 The contract, available to the Savannah Morning News through a prior request for game contracts through the Georgia Open Records Act, also provides 150 complimentary tickets to UMass program. If either team fails to play in the game, it would owe the other $100,000 in liquidated damages.
            
 The contract numbers are smaller than usual, but this season is unusual. Attendance at Georgia Southern home games is limited to up to 25% capacity (6,250) at the 25,000-seat Paulson Stadium because of health and safety protocols such as social distancing. Revenues from tickets, concessions, parking, etc., would reflect the smaller crowds, though the game is being broadcast on ESPN2.
   
 By comparison, contracts with other nonconference opponents, written and signed years not days in advance, are based on pre-coronavirus pandemic conditions.
   
 Campbell University, an FCS program which opened the season Sept. 12 at GS, was guaranteed $325,000, with the same number the payout for damages if the game was not played. The Fighting Camels, who signed the contract in November 2017, had more notice to make travel plans and 300 complimentary tickets at their disposal.
   
 The Citadel, which comes to Statesboro on Sept. 2, 2023, has a payout of $320,000, as agreed to in October 2018. That's the same rate for FCS Morgan State (playing Sept. 3, 2022) and FCS Gardner-Webb (Sept. 4, 2021).
   
 Maine was paid $325,000 to visit the Eagles on Sept.7, 2019, as was FCS South Carolina State on Sept. 1, 2018.
   
 Powerful deals
   
 When Georgia Southern is doing the traveling, it has scheduled teams in Power 5 conferences such as the Southeastern, Atlantic Coast and Big Ten, and the paydays are understandably much more lucrative.
   
 The Eagles were contracted for a $1.1 million payout (and the same would be owed for breaching the deal) at Clemson on Sept. 15, 2018. GS also received 2,500 comp tickets with an additional allotment of 2,000 to sell to its fans.
   
 The Aug. 31, 2019 game at eventual national champion LSU had been rescheduled a few times, and the price went up to $925,000, according to the contract.
   
 The Sept. 14, 2019 game at Minnesota of the Big Ten brought in $825,000 under the contract, as well as 300 comp tickets.
   
 The Eagles are slated to visit Arkansas of the SEC on Sept. 18, 2021 for a $1.4 million guarantee. The Sept. 10, 2022 game at Nebraska is worth slightly more at $1,423,000. The Sept. 16, 2023 game at Wisconsin is even higher at $1,450,000, and is matched by the damages clause.
   
 Georgia Southern has home-and-home arrangements with schools such as BYU (2021 and 2024), UAB (2022 and 2023), Ball State (2022 and 2023), Houston (2026 and 2027), Liberty (2025 and 2026) and Florida Atlantic (2020 and 2021). The BYU contract, unlike the standard home-and-home deals which don't have such payouts, guarantees the visiting team $100,000 with some provisions.
   
 The Eagles were supposed to open this season at Boise State, but concerns over the coronavirus led to a delayed start to Boise's season. The new arrangement has Boise still coming to Paulson in 2024, and GS going to Idaho in September 2028.
   
 Likewise, the Nov. 21 game this season at Ole Miss and its $1.4 million payout was erased when the SEC decided not to play games outside the conference. However, GS now has Ole Miss on its September 2024 calendar and a $1.6 million deal.
   
 Benko found a compelling replacement for Nov. 21 in a road trip to Army, which will pay the Eagles $225,000 to play against former GS head coach Jeff Monken and the Black Knights in West Point, N.Y.
   
 UMass is a relatively familiar opponent, as the teams played a home-and-home in October 2017 and September 2018. However, while the Eagles were paid $75,000 to come to Massachusetts in 2017 and could use it to defray expenses (travel, food, lodging), the Minutemen were not compensated for their visit, according to the contract signed in early 2015.
   
 Efforts to reach Benko and Bamford on Friday were unsuccessful.

“Today, the fascist leadership of Armenia committed yet another war crime. The cities of Ganja and Mingachevir came under rocket fire. As a result of this cowardly shelling, our compatriots have been killed and wounded,” said President Ilham Aliyev as he addressed the nation on October 17, following Armenia’s missile attack on Ganja, Azertag reported.
 “This once again shows the fascist nature of the Armenian leadership. This is not the first time our cities have come under fire. Armenia fires on Tartar, Aghdam, Goranboy, Aghjabadi and other cities practically every day. As a result of this fire, our citizens have been killed and wounded, more than 2,000 houses have been destroyed or seriously damaged. However, these cowardly actions cannot break the will of the Azerbaijani people.”
 President Ilham Aliyev noted that the Armenian leadership is committing a war crime. “Shooting at civilians, including firing missiles, is a war crime, and they must and will bear responsibility for this crime. We are giving their answer on the battlefield. We are avenging and will continue to avenge the deaths of innocent civilians on the battlefield. We have never fought or will ever wage a war against the civilian population. We are not Armenians. We have our own way, we have our own cause, and all the Azerbaijani people are united around this cause. All the Azerbaijani people are showing solidarity and patriotism,” the Azerbaijani President said.
 Thirteen people were killed and 52 others were injured as Armenian launched yet another missile attack on Ganja, Azerbaijan’s second-largest city with a population of over half a million people.

Phil Weaver, co-president/co-CEO of Shady Maple, said he hasn’t signed up because he’s worried about the potential liability of formally attesting the restaurant will follow the many guidelines, and then getting in trouble if an employee’s mask slips or customers get too close in the buffet line.
 “It’s not one page of regulations. It’s 20 to 30 pages of regulations,” Weaver said.
 Instead of doing the self-certification, Weaver said, the 2,000-seat smorgasbord continues to focus on following U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, which include social distancing and cleaning. Shady Maple also enforces a policy requiring customers to don disposable gloves for every visit to the buffet line.
 Weaver said those measures are what have allowed the smorgasbord to operate safely, not capacity limits, which he said he doesn't closely track. Yet if he can understand more about the self-certification program, Weaver said, he might eventually sign up.

CARO - The Cass City varsity football team ran its record to 5-0 on Friday night with a 54-0 road win over the Caro Tigers.      Red Hawks head coach Scott Cuthrell said his team really wanted to get a good push on their offensive line, and they accomplished that tonight. After a dramatic, come-from-behind win over the USA Patriots in Week 4, the Red Hawks' backs ran well on Friday night, he said, as they have for just about the entire season.      "I think we got back to doing things really well," Cuthrell said.|      The Cass City defense picked up its third shutout of the 2020 season and allowed just three points in the Red Hawks' Week 2 matchup with Reese. Senior Jeremy Velasquez played had a particularly strong game against Caro, Cuthrell said, and the defense rose to the occasion once again on Friday night.      "Those guys are playing good ball," he said. "(Velasquez) is a kid that really enjoys the game. He comes to play every week."      Cuthrell said his team watched film from the USA game to see if any adjustments were needed, but he said USA "played a great game."      "(USA) was a pretty physical game for us," he said. "We haven't been in one in quite some time. There was a little bit of a learning curve there. We just have to make sure we are ready every quarter for every down."

On the ensuing Durand possession, New Lothrop’s Bryce Cheney picked off Durand’s Trenton Boisclair and returned it for a touchdown.
 On the Hornets’ next possession, Rafael Wood punched in a 33-yard touchdown run, followed by a 19-yard touchdown pass from Cam Orr to Julius Garza.
 Orr added TD tosses to Cannon Cromwell (19 yards) and another to Muron (36 yards), before taking in a 24-yarder himself on the ground.
 New Lothrop began resting its starters in the second half, and Durand finished out the game’s scoring with a 30-yard strike from Boisclair to running back Charlie Rawlins. Boisclair finished the game 9 of 24 for 121 yards, one touchdown, and three picks. Rawlins led the Railroaders in rushing with 26 carries for 42 yards.
 Muron led the Hornets in rushing, with four carries for 82 yards and a TD. Wood and Orr added rushing scores of their own. Top receivers were Garza with his 54-yard TD snag, Muron with two receptions for 52 yards and a TD, and Garret Mangino with three catches and 33 yards.
 Defensively, Mangino had five tackles for New Lothrop, followed by Orr with 4.5, Garza with four, Kody Krupp with 3.5, Alec Mangino and Rafael Wood with three, and Isiah Pasik with 2.5. Cheney was huge on the defensive side for the Hornets, collecting two interceptions on New Lothrop’s side of the field.
 “Defensively all year, we’ve been stout,” Galvas said. “I think we’ve given up a score or two all year. Up front, we’re ball hawks and we’re creating turnovers. If we can do that, we can play with just about anyone.”
 Galvas said he was impressed by his team’s ability to create turnovers and control the game.
 “Turnovers got momentum on our side, and we have been able to get quick starts this season,” Galvas added. “We’ve been able to ride that throughout the season so far. I’m obviously really pleased with our performance.”

Two Democrats and one Republican are running for two spots on the Plymouth County Commission.
 Of the two Democrats in the race, Greg Hanley, 54, of Plymouth, is the incumbent.
 The other Democrat, 62-year-old Jack Riordon of Marshfield, was a county commissioner for three terms between 2000 and 2012.
 Rockland Rpublican Jared Valanzola, 32, ran unopposed in his primary.
 The second seat up for grabs is being vacated by Republican Daniel Pallotta, of Hanover. Hanley and Riordan were the top two vote-getters in the primary.
 Valanzola said he has a background of working in town government, including his elected position on the Rockland Planning Board, where he has served for the past five years. He formerly worked in the statehouse for Weymouth Mayor Robert Hedlund, when he was in the State Senate.
 Valanzola said he is fair-minded and he has his own ideas, but that Plymouth County government is not hyper partisan. His relationships with other elected and government officials are key and will allow him to "hit the ground running," he said.
 Valanzola said he knows how to manage budgets and do more with less, something he also sees as a facet of his party affiliation. He said he wants to help regionalize services for the 27 towns in the county's borders, a goal that all three candidates expressed.
 Hanley said he has a long history in government, from his time as a selectman in Pembroke and previously as city councilor in Quincy. He was elected to the county commission in 2012 and again in 2016. If reelected, he said, it will be his last term. Hanley said when he was elected, the county was at its lowest point and "poised to be taken over by the state."
 He said his greatest achievements on the commission have been securing $90 million in federal CARES Act money to distribute to the 27 communities in the county. Hanley said his other accomplishments include creating regional purchasing agreements for towns to get discounted rates on vehicles and the retirement of some debt obligations.
 Going forward, Hanley said, he wants to create housing for homeless veterans and expand regional trash collection and regional solar collaboration. He also said he wants to retire the county's debt, $17 million.
 In 2010, Riordan called for the dissolution of county government, calling it an unnecessary third layer of government and advocated handing its responsibilities to the state.
 Now, Riordan, a personal injury attorney, wants to be county commissioner again. He said he never called for the dissolution of the county government but, instead, he just wanted the state to take over the jail because the county was ill-equipped to handle the responsibility. Other programs, such as 4-H, should be administered by the county, he said.
 He said the role of county government should be performing functions that the cities and towns inside of it don't have the resources to do themselves. He wants to create a regional water entity to protect the water supply in Plymouth County because aquifers don't follow town borders.
 Voters in Massachusetts have until Oct. 24 to register to vote in the Nov. 3 primary and until Oct. 28 to request a mail-in ballot. Early voting will take place from Oct. 16 to Oct. 30.

No. 2: Make strides in the red zone. It’s inevitable that WSU’s opponents will come away with points on more than 75-80% of their trips into the red zone. They just need to come away with seven points far less than they did last season. The Cougars allowed their opponents to score touchdowns on 69% of red- zone trips in 2019. Meanwhile, Dickert’s Wyoming defense excelled in that category, allowing the opposition to score on 35% of red-zone trips.
