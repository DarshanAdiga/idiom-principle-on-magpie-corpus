“Aw, Dude, people don’t understand. That TUF gym was ridiculous. It’s a sauna in there when you’re fighting. Especially under all those lights. Cameras are there and everything, but they’re not right there in your face. There’s no walkout music. It’s not the same. It really does feel like you’re going out to fight in a backyard brawl.”

The All England Tennis Club (AELTC) took the decision to cancel Wimbledon 2020 on April 1, to the dismay of sports fans around the world, who were looking forward to a fortnight of world class tennis, celebrity spotting, and strawberries and cream. However, since the cancellation, the AELTC has been working hard behind the scenes in partnership with IBM to deliver tennis fans a Wimbledon experience that could go some way to filling the void left behind by the event. The pair today unveiled…

"Con este largo camino recorrido y desde el más estricto respeto a todos los pensamientos existentes en nuestra sociedad, llamamos, como entidad deportiva de referencia en nuestra tierra, a que los principios de respeto al prójimo y al juego limpio, tan presentes en el mundo del deporte, rijan también en los ámbitos político, social e institucional, en beneficio de todos", ha añadido.
 Al Espanyol, la situación que se vive en Catalunya en estos ámbitos le "entristece" y "conmociona" a todos sus "deportistas, dirigentes y profesionales" de la entidad y a su "fiel afición".
 "Y lo hace porque sacude fuertemente las convicciones personales de todos nosotros, sean cuales sean; todas respetables", remarcó.
 "El presente conflicto nos coloca como sociedad en una indeseada situación de riesgo y creciente confrontación. La obligada neutralidad política de un club deportivo, que hemos preservado, preservamos y preservaremos por encima de todo, pretende, con absoluta buena fe, no violentar ni por acción ni por omisión los sentimientos más profundos de todos y cada uno de nuestros socios, ya que pertenecen a su ámbito más íntimo y personal", ha proseguido el club 'perico'.
 En este sentido, advierte que "ante el evidente y elevado riesgo de que una escalada de acción-reacción" los representantes públicos catalanes y "de los diferentes agentes sociales", todo puede desembocar en una "una situación irreversible" y por ello hace "un llamamiento público a la responsabilidad, la reflexión, la sensatez, la generosidad, y la calma por parte de todos".
 "Y así, manifestamos nuestro deseo de que los graves hechos de los últimos días y semanas no vuelvan a producirse nunca más en Catalunya, ni se vivan otros con peores consecuencias", deseó, recalcando que con "la democracia, las instituciones de autogobierno y la convivencia cívica" es como la sociedad catalana "ha podido progresar" y que el club ha contribuido para "conseguir una sociedad plural y abierta".
 Por ello, el Espanyol considera que "estas importantes realidades, que han costado mucho de lograr, no pueden perderse". "Por ello, exhortamos a todos a contribuir de nuevo a la concordia y al diálogo.¡Paz social para Catalunya! ¡Viva el deporte! ¡Visca l'Espanyol!", sentencia.

“At this point in my career with seven Octagon trips, I did not expect to be fighting someone who is making his second. But, like I said before, I see the name value in fighting someone like Khama, who is coming off a big win over a really hyped-up opponent in Devonte Smith. So people know who Khama is. It’s not like I feel I’m getting the short end of the stick or anything. It’s still a good matchup for me. Stylistically, this is a great matchup. He’s going to want to trade on the feet. I’m the same way, but at the same time I feel I have a few more skills than he does to be able to dictate where this fight goes whenever I want to.”

Finding the right words to share with the entire Honda team about these issues is not easy, but we have to try. As a company, we acknowledge that we don't have all the answers, nor are we in a position to preach to others. But whatever words we choose must translate into action, and we must do the right thing."
 Honda has joined Coca Cola and Unilever, two of the largest advertisers across the world, as the latest companies to join the campaign against Facebook for failing to adequately police hateful and misleading content.
 Honda’s move comes amid Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s attempt to address advertiser concerns in a live question-and-answer session on Friday, where he announced minor changes to Facebook’s ad and content policies.
 Facebook has tried to quell the boycott behind the scenes, and has reached out to advertisers to push back on the narrative that it doesn’t care about fighting hate and misinformation.
 Facebook has been less effective than its rivals like Twitter or Snap to respond to what critics say are harmful posts from US President Donald Trump, as well as incendiary content that goes viral. Facebook, of these companies, is also the most susceptible to regulatory risk, and is already facing antitrust investigations from the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.

He said he helped the department become “way ahead of the game” when it comes to police reform and decriminalizing social problems and low-level crimes through the Care Campus, various MacArthur Safety and Justice programs, and the Quality of Life Unit. “I think we’ve made some big changes. There’s more to be done but we’re on the right track,” he said.
 Jegeris said he wasn’t in a rut, that he wasn’t out of ideas to improve the department. But he said he’s made his mark and it’s time for someone else to lead, and that it’s best for himself and the organization to leave when things are going well, so the department can keep positive momentum.
 “It’s time for me to get out of the way here so that it can go to the next level,” he said. “It’s time for me to take all of that skill that I’ve built and put it in a new direction.”
