_Napoli, 19 ago 13:01 - (Agenzia Nova)_ \- È on line il programma elettorale della coalizione di centro destra con Stefano Caldoro candidato presidente della Regione Campania. Un programma "aperto" e condiviso attraverso la piattaforma www.lacampaniaditutti.it per raccogliere i contributi di tutti. Dieci idee per la Campania, dieci macro tematiche sviluppate in ulteriori proposte dettagliate e che spaziano dall'azzeramento delle tasse e del bollo auto, all'istituzione di un reddito di salute e alla pace edilizia per risolvere l'annosa questione dei condoni di necessità. Ma, anche sanità, scuola, servizi e supporto alle imprese, al commercio all'economia e al lavoro. Per ogni proposta del programma vengono individuate le coperture economiche degli interventi previsti. Il programma nasce con il contributo e la condivisione delle istanze raccolte sul territorio regionale dalle forze politiche di centro destra e dai movimenti attraverso le attività di un tavolo ad hoc, coordinato da Giuseppe Russo e Salvatore Varriale. Il programma è aperto a tutti coloro che vorranno far pervenire le proprie idee e proposte attraverso la piattaforma dedicata al programma, www.lacampaniaditutti.it. (segue) (Ren)

Really brings home the whole debate about respecting old time cultural traditions because that is supposedly better than forcing "western" values on everyone. C'mon,it's the 21st century, certain values should be global in this day and age. Just say no. Everybody doesn't have to go along with every primitive tradition in order to de-colonize the world. De-colonize to what? This?

All elections are about turnout in the toss-up states, as Hillary Clinton and the Democrats learned four years ago.

I saw that last night, but it hadn't been verified by a good source, or even dated, so I didn't post it. It both shocking and and problematically intriguing, comments I saw made that clear. People were saying--that's horrific but actually the ambassador is stuck between a rock and a hard place. Because Kiribati is courting China's interest and it is their custom and they wanted to show respect to the Chinese, that that's how they show respect. That like it or not, it's not really the Chinese ambassador's fault, it he says no to doing it, it would be insulting them.

Pinkvilla had previously reported that Parth Samthaan has decided to make an exit from Kasautii Zindagii Kay to concentrate on his other projects and health. The discussions are on with the channel and production and they have been trying to retain Parth as Anurag. However, simultaneously, the makers have shortlisted a few names to replace Samthaan. Apparently, talks are on with Barun Sobti, Vijayendra Kumeria, Vivek Dahiya regarding the same. However, the buzz is that if the makers are unable to find a right replacement for Parth, they might pull the plug off for the show.

_Napoli, 18 ago 10:45 - (Agenzia Nova)_ \- “I presidi,insieme con il personale docente, si sono già fatti carico di scelte fondamentali per la prevenzione e il contrasto del covid19 e per la riorganizzazione della scuola, colmando anche i ritardi e le confusioni ministeriali, con la riapertura dell'anno scolastico bisogna evitare che tutto il peso delle scelte e della nuova organizzazione scolastica gravi su di loro e soprattutto essi vanno salvaguardati dalla responsabilità penale in caso di contagi o di altre forme di insicurezza che possano investire la popolazione scolastica". E' quanto ha affermato la dirigente nazionale di Fd’I, vice responsabile per le politiche per il Sud, Gabriella Peluso. "Nel Mezzogiorno - ha proseguito Peluso - mancano diecimila aule scolastiche e cio' rende ancora più complicata la riorganizzazione scolastica richiesta ai Presidi e la stessa prevenzione della diffusione dei contagi. Inoltre, da tempo, denunciamo la fatiscenza degli edifici scolastici nel Sud che costituisce un rischio per la incolumità della popolazione scolastica e per le eventuali responsabilità dei presidi. In questo scenario, occorre assolutamente proteggere da responsabilita' penali questi fondamentali dirigenti che, va ricordato, sono retribuiti in quantità nettamente inferiore rispetto a tutti gli altri dirigenti della Pubblica amministrazione, pur rivestendo un ruolo fondamentale ed assumendosi responsabilità molto elevate", ha concluso l’esponente del partito di Giorgia Meloni.

The Cleveland County Arts Council annual Real to Reel Film Festival is on track to offer new documentaries, feature films, animations and film shorts.
   
 It will just look a little different this year.
   
 Originally slated as an in-person festival, the 21st annual International Real to Reel Film Fest has been modified to be an online-exclusive platform due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 The festival will be held from Sept. 9 to Oct. 9.
   
 The mission of the Real to Reel International Film Festival is to offer a forum for independent film, video and multimedia artists from around the world to showcase their talents and expose the works of these artists to the region.
   
 "We are excited to work with Seed and Spark (a virtual film festival provider) to bring Real to Reel Film Festival into the virtual festival space via their platform," said Violet Dukes, festival director.
   
 Tickets will be available at the end of August, and festival attendees will have an entire month to explore, at their convenience, documentaries, short films, animation, and films made by children. Offering the online-exclusive version the festival will provide a wider audience reach.
   
 "One highlight for audience members will be the chance to hear behind the scenes details about select films," said Noel T. Manning II, Real to Reel co- founder, and selection committee member. "Several international filmmakers will share interviews on their craft, their film, and the impact of film festivals on independent cinema."
   
 These Q&A; sessions will be available for the duration of the Real to Reel Film Festival.
   
 The selection committee screened nearly 150 film submissions, from amateur and professional filmmakers, including animated shorts, live-action shorts, documentaries, feature-length narrative films, and films made by children ages 14 years and younger.
   
 International countries of origin for submissions include India, Japan, Iran, Russia, and Slovakia, among others. The festival will screen 44 films based on the selections made by the committee.
   
 Awards categories will be classified by their student/amateur or professional submission status.
   
 Last year's Real to Reel Film Festival saw an attendance of approximately 300 people.
   
 "While this year's festival will certainly have a different feel, we're excited to once again bring diverse, educational and entertaining independent films to our community and beyond," said Shearra Miller, president of the Cleveland County Arts Council.

And while they're at it, lawmakers could do the right thing and finally extend Medicaid coverage. Led by the state Senate leader, Republican Phil Berger of Rockingham County, Republicans have adamantly refused to expand Medicaid coverage since the Affordable Care Act offered that possibility in 2012. Over the years, all but 12 states have chosen to expand health coverage. But even in the midst of a public health crisis, North Carolina Republicans still say no.
