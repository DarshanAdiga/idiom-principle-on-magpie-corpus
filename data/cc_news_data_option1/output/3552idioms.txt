In the long run, the company accused Nigeria of breaching the terms of contracts after negotiations were opened with the Cross River State government for allocation of land for the project. It claimed failure to construct the pipeline system to supply the gas “frustrated the construction of the gas project, thereby depriving it of the potential benefits from over 20 years’ worth of gas supplies."

Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims have fled Buddhist-majority Myanmar due to a military crackdown, and many live in densely crowded refugee camps in Bangladesh. Rights activists fear large numbers of Rohingya have gone to sea, fleeing persecution in Myanmar and hardship in the camps in Bangladesh, where traffickers may promise the refugees a better life abroad.

Good morning and happy Labor Day Monday! It's been a picture perfect holiday weekend, and we look to end it with similar conditions today, although, temperatures will be just a few degrees warmer than Sunday. If you can, get out and enjoy the warm weather because big time changes are in the forecast starting tomorrow. For Tuesday, a strong, early season cold front will be making its way through the South Plains from Canada tomorrow afternoon. So for our northern counties, expect your highs tomorrow to be cooler, as the front will make its way through your neck of the woods first, then the farther south you are, the warmer you will get before the front plows through. The front should make its way through the entire region before sunset, and temperatures will freefall to the 40s overnight. We will also see the chance for showers and thunderstorms along and ahead of the frontal passage. Some storms have the potential to be strong to severe, so make sure to stay weather aware tomorrow afternoon. After the front passes, we will see light to moderate rainfall overnight and throughout the day on Wednesday. Winds will be howling out of the north anywhere from 20 to 30 mph, with gusts as high as 40 mph. The wind and rain will prevent temperatures from getting out of the 50s for most of the region on Wednesday. Showers stay in the forecast through Thursday, while temperatures are slow to warm to the 60s. Sunshine looks to return on Friday afternoon with highs reaching the mid 70s. 7 day rainfall totals look to be very healthy for most. This rain event will not eliminate the drought, it does look to make quite a big dent in it!

To be fair, the Bucks typically start each game and quarter with fairly crisp movement while whipping the ball from player to player. This keeps the defense on its toes and gives Milwaukee some good scoring opportunities. However, like clockwork, they always default to 1-4 low pick-and-rolls or mid-range isolations for Antetokounmpo or Middleton as each quarter winds down. It’s no surprise the Heat average nearly 40 more passes per game than the Bucks in this series.

Right when it felt like the Bucks were running out of gas—they fell behind by eight points just a few minutes into the fourth quarter—they mounted an unlikely comeback by going on a 12-0 run that spanned nearly 5 and a half minutes of gameplay. The two teams exchanged blows down the stretch with Donte DiVincenzo knocking down one of two free throws to tie the game with 1.9 seconds left and forcing overtime. In the extra period, it was Money Middleton once again, as he scored nine of the Bucks 11 points to lead Milwaukee to a three-point victory.

KANSAS CITY -- The Kansas City Chiefs are content to defend their Super Bowl title largely with the team that won it.


   


  After signing a handful of veteran free agents during an offseason unlike any other, the Chiefs waived the majority of them Saturday as they trimmed down to 53 players for the start of the regular season. Among the notable names were running back DeAndre Washington, who was signed from Oakland, and former Miami safety Adrian Colbert.


   


  Even the veterans could be back, though. The coronavirus pandemic has altered the rules for the practice squad, allowing teams to retain 16 players and up to six with accrued seasons to help deal with the potential of an outbreak.


   


  "We tell them at the beginning, 'Listen, not everybody is going to make our football team,'" Chiefs coach Andy Reid said, "'but make it as hard as you possibly can on us to make that decision. And don't count the number in the line. Just go play.'"


   


  Most of the players waived as the Chiefs trimmed from their 80-man camp roster ahead of their opener Thursday night against Houston were inexpensive fliers and undrafted free agents. That's because they spent the majority of the offseason -- and the majority of their salary cap -- taking care of the core group that won their first title in 50 years.


   


  The Chiefs gave a 10-year contract extension to quarterback Patrick Mahomes that could ultimately pay him a half-billion dollars, then followed it with long-term deals for Pro Bowl defensive tackle Chris Jones and star tight end Travis Kelce.


   


  The Chiefs waived quarterbacks Matt Moore and Jordan Ta'amu, which means they are content having just Chad Henne backing up Mahomes for Week 1. Running back Elijah McGuire lost out on a backup job to Darrel Williams, another member of the Super Bowl team, while wide receivers Jody Fortson, Maurice Ffrench, Gehrig Dieter, Justice Shelton-Mosley and Kalija Lipscomb were cut loose in favor of keeping special teams ace Marcus Kemp.


   


  Offensive linemen Jackson Barton, Ryan Hunter, Darryl Williams and Greg Senat were released with tight end Dan Helm.


   


  The biggest name let go on defense was Breeland Speaks, the Chiefs' second- round pick in 2018, who missed last season to an injury. Also waived were defensive lineman Tim Ward, Braxton Hoyett and Devaroe Lawrence; linebackers Omari Cobb and Darius Harris; and defensive backs Rodney Clemons, Lavert Hill and Chris Lammons.


   


  Offensive lineman Yasir Durant and defensive lineman Tershawn Wharton made the team as undrafted rookies.


   


  Another offensive lineman, Martinas Rankin, will start the season on the PUP list as he recovers from knee surgery.


   


  Still, the minimal roster turnover means the Chiefs could have an advantage early in the season. Most of the team was already familiar with the playbook before the pandemic scuttled offseason workouts and all four preseason games, which are typically crucial for young and rebuilding teams as they try to polish off their rosters.


   


  "Normally you go through the cuts and if it's a veteran player you release, you meet with him, and the young guys, you give them encouragement to move on," Reid said. "We're going to support the guys. If they've made it this far with us, we're going to support them. If somebody calls us about them, we want them to be successful. If you're with us, you're with us, and if we can't keep you, we want you to make it somewhere else. That's this year or any year."


   


  The Chiefs were able to keep a couple extra players because cornerback Bashaud Breeland, who is suspended for the first four games, and defensive tackle Mike Pennel, who must sit out the first two, don't count against their 53. They also had a trio of players opt out in right guard Laurent Duvernay- Tardif, running back Damien Williams and rookie Lucas Niang.


   


  Now, the frenzy will begin as teams begin to claim players that were waived, even though they may have to rely on game film from college and the scouting combine because there were no preseason games to scout.


   


  "(General manager) Brett Veach has a pretty good feel with his guys for who is out there," Reid said, "and players he has graded previously, whether it's college or pro. So he's on top of all that. I know they're working like crazy right now."

 At the time, Young was four outs away from the 18th perfect game in MLB history. Flirting with the feat was further amplified by his comeback from the line drive off his face earlier that May off the bat of Albert Pujols.
 “When it got to the eighth,” Padres manager Bud Black said, “I started thinking about what a bright day it was for Chris, what with everything he’s been through this season. I thought it could happen.”
 Young went on to go 7-6 with a 3.96 ERA, 93 strikeouts and a 1.29 WHP in 102 1/3 innings for the Padres that season.

In terms of those who break the rules that are set for them in whatever country or community they hail from, they usually follow certain pattern that will be common in most european countries including Britain and Spain. First up, we have those people who don’t really care anyway and believe rightly or wrongly, that Covid-19 has nothing to do with them - so why should they follow a silly set of rules anyway? A simple minded group, not much given to social analysis, who have and will continue to break governmental guidelines at any given time. Then we have young people - who are really fed-up with the whole coronavirus business and in some ways I really don’t blame them. When you are a mid-late teenager, not being allowed out to socialise with friends really is a big-deal. It is that time in their lives when they are discovering who they are and what they want from life and being stuck indoors with tedious parents and perhaps younger siblings isn’t really part of the deal that they thought their life would be about prior to 2020. I know that this may sound trite in the extreme, but imagine yourself at sixteen having to suffer a seemingly endless set of rules that confine and restrict your life - because of a disease that almost certainly will not affect you medically? Last but not least - we have those who see themselves as part of a bulwark against an overweening government, set upon restricting their lives for no good reason. In Spain, this grouping might spring from those who remember (or claim to remember) the sins of previous political regimes - where you did what you were told or else!

  Although all three of the remaining moms would love to hoist the trophy next weekend on Arthur Ashe Stadium, it seems clear to Azarenka that it's about much more than winning or losing.


  "Identifying myself or other players just as mothers, I think that's not the only thing that we are," Azarenka said earlier this week. "I think being a mother [is part of it, but] we are also tennis players. We are also women who have dreams and goals and passions.


  "Everybody has their own priority. They have their own list of where they rank being a mother is, but we are not -- it's not _just_ being a mother. Your life doesn't stop. My life just began when I became a mother. I'll say that really openly.


  "So I think to see the rise of women being able to fulfill their dreams, as well as balancing motherhood, I think they all are heroes. I really, really appreciate all of them. And I hope this continues to go on where women are inspired to do what they love to do, but still being able to go after what they want. Because I think for the kids, and I hope for my son, it's inspiring that I still want to do what I want to do, and I work really hard for that. I want to be the example to my son."
