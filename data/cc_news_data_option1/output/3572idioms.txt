DODGE CENTER, Minn. (KEYC) - The Dodge County Sheriff’s Office is warning residents to avoid keeping pets and young children outside unattended after a cougar spotting over the weekend.Officers responded to the area just north of Dodge Center Saturday morning. This is a photo taken by authorities when they arrived at the scene. A resident told police they spotted the cougar coming near their property, but it did not seem interested in approaching them. A DNR officer also responded. They believe the cougar may be one to two years old, and they don’t believe it is likely a public safety threat, but authorities are asking residents to err on the side of caution when they are outdoors.Copyright 2020 KEYC.

 Beneath the brim of a beat-up baseball cap twinkle a pair of young, blue eyes, contrasting the wrinkles and long, white beard that age has left John Okulsky of Cadosia, or “Coon Hill John,” as he prefers.
 Coon Hill has devoted his life to bringing smiles and happiness to everyone he encounters and last month, the Delaware County Senior Center Council chose to recognize him as the 1995 Senior Citizen of the Year.
 On a meager veterans’ pension and through some help from friends, Okulsky sponsors an annual Easter egg hunt for local children, a free community Christmas dinner, plants flowers around homes and performs countless acts of kindness that have earned him the respect for the community.

ARREST — At about noon, deputies began searching the area around Albertsons in Buellton for Drake Pettersen, for whom the U.S. Marshals Services had issued an arrest warrant for possession of methamphetamine.
 Deputies subsequently learned Pettersen had made his way to the 1900 block of Highway 246, west of Buellton, and while en route to the area a woman flagged down a deputy to report a man had walked past her on his way into a women’s restroom.
 Through a window, the deputy was able to see the man matched Pettersen’s description and, with assistance from a California Highway Patrol K9 unit, convinced the man to come out and surrender.
 Because Pettersen was reported to be heavily under the influence of an intoxicating agent, Santa Barbara County Fire Department and AMR ambulance crews responded to attend to him prior to his arrest.
 ARREST — Deputies were again called to the area near Albertsons in Buellton around 6:45 p.m. to locate a man the Ventura County Sheriff’s Department suspected of kidnapping two children.
 Ventura County deputies described the suspect as a heavy-set Hispanic man with a shaved head and a tattoo that said “Ivan” on his right forearm who might be driving a black 2002 Ford Explorer.
 Deputies located the suspect, identified as Juan Carlos Cervantes, sitting in his SUV in the parking lot and detained him, but did not find the two children he was suspected of kidnapping.
 It was later determined there was no kidnapping when Ventura County deputies located the two children at the Gaviota rest stop on the southbound side of Highway 101.
 Cervantes was cited for a misdemeanor arrest warrant issued by Santa Barbara County as well as for suspicion of possessing methamphetamine and drug paraphernalia and was released.
 However, he was arrested by Ventura County deputies on a felony warrant issued by that county.

Bloomberg) -- In the clearest sign yet of the challenges to nickel mining in New Caledonia, a would-be buyer failed to put together a deal that would have seen it paid to acquire a major asset.
 New Century Resources Ltd. said Tuesday it was unable to generate a funding package and equity structure that “adequately accommodates a suitable risk/reward scenario” to acquire the Goro operations from Vale SA.
 Vale’s response was equally telling. The Rio de Janeiro-based said it would prepare to mothball Goro while exploring other options, all of which would “contemplate Vale’s exit.” The decision comes even with nickel’s prospects bolstered by growing demand for use in rechargeable batteries as part of an electric-vehicle boom.
 The failure to offload the operations comes after a string of financial and operational setbacks at a mine that was brought online late and over-budget in 2010. Goro struggled to hit production capacity in subsequent years.
 “Despite significant resources, the operation has continued to disappoint and has never achieved design production rates, remaining a cash drain on the larger group,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Edward Sterck wrote.
 Vale picked up Goro as part of its 2007 acquisition of Inco, a deal that led to it becoming the world’s largest producer of mined nickel. But in a decade of production, Goro never reached more than 70% capacity and capital expenditure overruns exceeded $3 billion, showing the difficulties producing nickel from laterite deposits using the high pressure acid leach process, according to BloombergNEF.
 In the wake of two deadly waste-dam spills at Vale’s operations in Brazil, the miner has also faced criticism over the use of similar tailing dams facilities at Goro. Acid spills have also interrupted processing operations.
 In May, New Century said it was negotiating an arrangement under which it would be paid to take over the operations. Now that an exclusivity period with the Australian company has lapsed, Vale will start to place Goro on care and maintenance. That could be a precursor to a halt in production, unless a solution can be found in the coming months.
 The miner continues to discuss the asset’s future with the French state and local authorities, and will approach the closure of the mine with strong commitments to the maintenance of the dam and its social obligations, Vale said.

They were the only rookies to reach East Lake, and Scheffler had a 66-65 weekend to finish alone in fifth. Hovland tied for 20th at the Tour Championship. So it’s a matter of how much players who vote value a victory, even against a weak field that didn’t include anyone from the top 50.
 Scheffler had seven top 10s, compared with three for Hovland. He also played in the final group at the PGA Championship, where he tied for fourth.
 Meanwhile, Webb Simpson wrapped up the Vardon Trophy for the lowest adjusted scoring average. Thomas won the money list with $7,344,040. It was the third time in the last four years Thomas has won the money title, even though the tour stopped presenting an award for that.
 Thomas will get a trophy from the PGA of America for its points-based award for player of the year. Because golf was not played for three months, the race ended before the Tour Championship. Thomas won on the strength of three wins (each worth 10 points), 20 points for winning the money list and 16 points for being third in scoring average.

Beyond the tech stock slump, other worries are also hanging over the stock market, which had been setting record highs just last week.
 Pessimism is rising that Democrats and Republicans in Washington will be able to find a deal to send more aid to unemployed workers and an economy still struggling amid the pandemic. Investors have been largely assuming that a deal would eventually pass, but recent talks between government leaders have yielded no progress.
 Riki Ogawa at the Asia & Oceania Treasury Department at Mizuho Bank in Singapore warned that plenty of other uncertainties remained, such as President Donald Trump’s comments about “decoupling” the U.S. economy from China, as the presidential campaign heats up.
 The relationship between the world’s two largest economies has been on edge for years, and all the uncertainty threatens to exacerbate the global economy’s already shaky standing.
 “We appear to be short on clarity,” said Ogawa.
 Energy stocks had some of Wall Street's sharpest drops as the price of oil tumbled. Apache lost 9.8%, and Occidental Petroleum fell 8.9% after benchmark U.S. crude sank 7.5% to $36.79 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 6.1% to $39.43.
 But the losses were widespread across the market, with 86% of stocks in the S&P 500 lower.
 Among the few gainers was General Motors. It rose 9.6% after it said it's taking an ownership stake in electric-vehicle company Nikola. GM will also engineer and build Nikola’s Badger hydrogen fuel cell and electric pickup truck as part of the partnership.

The president then proceeded to say what he had just denied ever saying.
 Full Coverage: Virus Outbreak
 “What I said is by the end of the year, but I think it could even be sooner that that,” he said about a vaccine. “It could be during the month of October, actually could be before November.”
 Under a program Trump calls “Operation Warp Speed,” the goal is to have 300 million doses of a coronavirus vaccine in stock by January. He has spent hundreds of billions of dollars on what amounts to a huge gamble since vaccine development usually takes years.
 Concerns exist about political influence over development of a vaccine, and whether one produced under this process will be safe and effective.
 Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious-disease expert and a member of the White House coronavirus task force, told CNN last week that it is unlikely but “not impossible” that a vaccine could win approval in October, instead of November or December.
 Fauci added that he’s “pretty sure” a vaccine would not be approved for Americans unless it was both safe and effective.
 Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, has said the agency would not cut corners as it evaluates vaccines, but would aim to expedite its work. He told the Financial Times last week that it might be “appropriate” to approve a vaccine before clinical trials were complete if the benefits outweighed the risks.
 White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, meanwhile, has given assurances that Trump “will not in any way sacrifice safety” when it comes to a vaccine. And executives of five top pharmaceutical companies pledged that no COVID-19 vaccines or treatments will be approved, even for emergency use, without proof they are safe and effective.
 Some concerns were sparked by a letter dated Aug. 27 in which Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, asked governors to help government contractor McKesson Corp. make sure vaccine distribution facilities are up and running by Nov. 1.
 Redfield did not say a vaccine would be ready by then.
 Three COVID-19 vaccines are undergoing final-stage, or Phase 3, clinical trials in the U.S. Each study is enrolling about 30,000 people who will get two shots, three weeks apart, and then will be monitored for coronavirus infections and side effects for anywhere from a week to two years.

Now here is the golden nugget. Stockdale was asked, what was the characteristic of the ones who did not make it out of the prison camp? “The optimists, the ones who said we’ll be out by Christmas, and then said we’ll be out by Easter – those are the ones who died of a broken heart.” Stockdale goes on to say, “You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality.”
 Let’s read that last sentence one more time together.
 That is the paradox — living with a brutal reality on a day-to-day basis balanced against never losing hope. People want to believe the optimist (the virus will magically disappear), but “they come unglued when those predictions don’t work out.” But remember, different than blind optimism is the belief that something good could happen. Could, not will. For the entrepreneur in the trenches, he must calculate the odds of success and play for the possibility of a good turn of cards, of a customer showing up, of the investor saying yes — and at the same time, lose some sleep every night worrying about a Plan B and concocting a Plan C.
 The Stockdale Paradox can be summed up as “have faith but confront reality.” A corollary here is to embrace some form of stoicism. Groysberg talks about Marsha Linehan, the founder of “radical acceptance.” She says, “You can’t change anything if you don’t accept it.” Otherwise, you will be working on something that isn’t real. Entrepreneurs need to truly embrace this kind of clear thinking. Linehan goes on to say, “that even when the darkness falls, there is always a glimmer of light”.

ARREST — Deputies were called to the intersection of First Street and Elverhoy Way in Solvang shortly before 2 p.m. to investigate a report of a man walking in the roadway and throwing a backpack.
 The man identified himself as Joshua Cain, but deputies were unable to find a match to someone of that name with the information he provided, and when he was asked simple questions, he allegedly was unable to articulate coherent answers and exhibited signs of being under the influence of a controlled substance.
 He was arrested on suspicion of being intoxicated on drugs in public and booked into County Jail.
 INCIDENT — A vehicle stolen in Lompoc was recovered in the 1400 block of Aarhus Drive in Solvang after it was parked there with its windows rolled down for three days.
 The registered owner was contacted and took possession of the vehicle.
 ARREST — Deputies were called to the Avenue of Flags in Buellton about 6:35 p.m. to investigate a reported hit-and-run involving a woman whose vehicle towing a trailer struck a gas pump at the 76 gas station.
 The woman, identified as Christina Linn, gave her phone number to the station manager, then allegedly began yelling at him and drove away. Leaving the gas station, deputies spotted the suspect’s vehicle parked behind Motel 6 on McMurray Road with a woman inside and a man standing outside.
 When deputies questioned Linn about the hit-and-run, she allegedly became aggressive and challenged deputies to a fight, and as she was being detained in handcuffs, she alleged kicked one deputy and tried to kick another.
 Speaking with the man, identified as Ryan Hebert, deputies discovered a warrant for his arrest had been issued in Shasta County.
 Hebert was arrested on the warrant, Linn was arrested on suspicion of hit-and- run, and both were booked into Santa Barbara County Jail. Linn’s vehicle and trailer were towed away.

Dustin Johnson won the silver trophy as the FedEx Cup champion. Odds are he soon will pick up another trophy, this one a bronze variety in the image of Jack Nicklaus.
 The vote for PGA Tour player of the year was up in the air going into the Tour Championship, with only one major being played and six players with multiple victories. The winner at East Lake was thought to be the front-runner. Johnson’s victory gave him three titles this season, tied with Justin Thomas.
 With the short turnaround to the new season — two days between the final putt at East Lake and the opening drive at the Safeway Open in California — the ballots were going out this week to the players.
 For the PGA Tour player of the year, the candidates were Johnson, Thomas, PGA champion Collin Morikawa (two wins), Webb Simpson (two wins) and Jon Rahm (two wins).

WASHINGTON (AP) — Israel and the United Arab Emirates will sign&nbsp;their historic deal normalizing relations&nbsp;at a White House ceremony on Sept. 15, U.S. officials said Tuesday.The officials said senior delegations from both countries will likely be led by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Emirati Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the brother of the UAE crown prince. The officials, who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, said the ceremony would either be on the South Lawn, the Rose Garden or inside depending on weather.The ceremony will come just a month after the agreement to&nbsp;establish full diplomatic relations&nbsp;was announced on Aug. 13. The The historic deal delivered a key foreign policy victory to President Donald Trump as he seeks reelection, and reflected a changing Middle East in which shared concerns about archenemy Iran have largely overtaken traditional Arab support for the Palestinians.That announcement has been followed by the&nbsp;first direct commercial flight between the countries,&nbsp;the establishment of telephone links and commitments to cooperate in numerous areas.UAE has also ended the country’s boycott of Israel, which allows trade and commerce between the oil-rich Emirates and Israel, home to a thriving diamond trade, pharmaceutical companies and tech start-ups.The Palestinians have rejected the deal. The UAE presented the agreement as taking Israel’s planned annexation of parts of the occupied West Bank off the table. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted the pause was “temporary.”Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

BARLETTA - «Potrei rispondere da ex paracadutista, nel senso che ho fatto, a differenza di Salvini, i lanci da militare ed e una cosa seria che lascerei fare ai professionisti; se poi lo fa per ragioni sportive, gli consiglio di allenarsi perche farlo per fare uno show e sempre pericoloso, se lo fa per ragioni sportive gli consiglio di farlo con degli sportivi che possano aiutarlo». Cosi ha commentato il ministro Francesco Boccia a Barletta, a margine di un incontro elettorale, a proposito dell'intenzione del leader della Lega di lanciarsi col paracadute sulla Toscana per la campagna elettorale. «La politica per noi pero non e uno show - ha detto Boccia - e arrivato qui l'altro giorno dicendo che ci avrebbe cacciato tutti ma gli voglio dire attraverso voi che i pugliesi non si fanno cacciare da casa loro, i pugliesi restano qui e continuano a costruire una Puglia migliore». «A Salvini - conclude Boccia - chiedo di dare una mano al paese, per una volta di non tifare contro, di confrontarsi con noi, gli chiedo di aprire un confronto, un dibattito serio in Parlamento subito dopo le regionali, anche sul Mes».
