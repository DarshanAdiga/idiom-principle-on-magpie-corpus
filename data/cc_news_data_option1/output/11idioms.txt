Greta Gerwig’s “Little Women” is a revelation and stands as a testament to the classic novel’s timelessness.
 The latest film adaptation doesn’t reinvent the wheel. While Gerwig has cut her teeth as an art house actress and director, she doesn’t experiment much here. In fact, the biggest change narratively speaking is simply telling all of the events in a nonlinear way. Otherwise, this is the same story — for the most part.
 Consider Amy March, who a lot of folks have hated over the years. I was one of them. She is petulant and selfish. Two words: Jo’s manuscript.
 Whether in Louisa May Alcott’s book or one of the many film adaptations, Amy is a hard pill to swallow. Until Greta Gerwig got a hold of her, that is.
 Gerwig doesn’t completely rewrite the character, but she does add a level of depth and nuance to Amy that she hasn’t received in other film adaptations. For the first time, I actually understood Amy and, even more shocking, liked her. (Granted, Florence Pugh, who plays the youngest March, deserves a great deal of the credit, too. Her portrayal is fantastic.) We still hate Amy for burning Jo’s manuscript, but it’s a bit more short-lived, thanks to Pugh and Gerwig.
 “Little Women” tells the story of the four March sisters — Jo (Saoirse Ronan), Meg (Emma Watson), Beth (Eliza Scanlan) and Amy — growing up in 1860s America. Their father (Bob Odenkirk) is away fighting in the Civil War, and their beloved mother, Marmee (Laura Dern), is not only raising these girls by herself, but she’s offering food, aid and support to those waiting at home.
 While the book is told linearly and takes us from the girls’ youth to adulthood, Gerwig alters our perspective of the events in their lives. For example, she makes the clever decision to introduce us to the adult versions of the March girls first. We meet Amy and Laurie (Timothée Chalamet) as adults in France long before we meet all of them as impressionable teens navigating the pitfalls of youth.
 Jo and Laurie are one of literature’s most famous pairs. (For those who know the story, a young Laurie offers his heart to Jo but is rejected. Later, he ends up with Amy.) Many think they should have ended up together, and Amy was simply the next best thing. I’ve even thought it myself. Gerwig skirts the issue by allowing us to watch the relationship between Amy and Laurie develop first.
 It’s a smart move.
 There are a lot of smart moves in “Little Women.” Jo is often everyone’s favorite March because of her chutzpah, passion and tenacity. She turns the world on its head, and it’s fun to watch. Ronan — who was also Gerwig’s leading lady in “Ladybird” — captures Jo’s essence beautifully.
 Meg’s story is a bit secondary here, so Watson isn’t given a lot to work with. It’d be impossible to give all the girls equal play, but it does feel a bit like Meg’s just thrown in because they had to.
 Beth’s tale is still tragic. The film treats her death as more of a sudden event, though, while the book devoted an entire chapter to her slowly fading away. Again, the written word allows for a lot more than a two-hour movie.
 While I sit down and sort through my thoughts, it’s apparent that “Little Women” is a story I struggle to see on its own terms. I compare it to the novel I’ve read countless times and screen versions I’ve watched countless others.
 As a director or writer, that’s an uncomfortable place to be seen with the number of reboots and remakes that fail every year to connect with fans who scrutinize every creative decision. These fans are brutal, and they don’t like when something they hold dear is not given the treatment they feel it deserves.
 Luckily, Gerwig manages to craft something that feels authentic and familiar, while drawing out material about art, copyright ownership and gender roles that have long been overlooked.
 The end result is something that feels like both a personal artistic statement and pop filmmaking. It is nothing short of astounding, and I look forward to seeing where Gerwig’s career goes from here.

One of the best aspects of the night from my own standpoint was the diversity on display in my old Kentucky hometown. Between Simmons breaking out a unique style of freeform rhyming on the mic as a true M.C., or the soulful sounds of The Company Band of Charlotte, NC, breaking out numbers from artists like Stevie Wonder, Earth, Wind & Fire, Somerset got a taste of a different cultural flavor from what's the norm here in rural Appalachia (said by someone who grew up in eastern Kentucky as well as Pulaski County). Meanwhile, over at Jarfly Brewing Co., brew fans were treated to acts like Tiny Tiny with their electronic approach and hip-hop artist Envy Lux. We get better as a community when we embrace sights and sounds that haven't been the focus at these types of shindigs in the past, and I -- as the kids these days say -- am here for it.
 Fortunately, the good folks with The Company Band, who performed right up until the midnight ball drop and again afterward for another hour, were happy to be here for it as well.
 "It's such a pleasure to be here in Somerset for this glorious New Year's Eve celebration," said Hanoch Hickman, founder, creative director, and amazing keyboardist for The Company Band, just before they went on with an array of singers, a horn section, and energy enough to light up the night. "I'm definitely feeling the vibe, feeling the crowd. The production is awesome. Definitely over the top, and I think the city has outdone themselves."
 In addition to the visitors from Charlotte, the Light Up 2020 Bash featured plenty of homegrown talent as well. Youthful crooner Chase Cimala and well- known singer-songwriter act Kevin Dalton and the Tuesday Blooms both performed to the earlier crowd, in conjunction with new music releases, and got to take part in this historic occasion -- much like me, enjoying the excitement of getting to say they "were there" for this.
 "I was very, very happy with the crowd. I was worried about the temperature, but it was amazing. The whole thing was amazing," said Dalton, a familiar face at local performance venues and events like Master Musicians Festival. "I'm really proud to be part of it, the first time Somerset has done this. I've been on stage and playing around here for a long time, and wanted to see this kind of stuff happen, and so frustrated forever that it didn't happen. So I'm very, very happy and thankful to the mayor and the city for making these changes."
 Getting to be down in front of the stage, in the midst of people dancing and grooving, was something special. Getting to see all these people out on New Year's, not just settling to be a small town that watches the "big city" celebrate New Year's Eve on TV, but doing something big ourselves ... that's also something special. Getting to count down from 10 and hug my friends as tiny pieces of paper rained down on us -- again, special.
 It's Somerset's first major New Year's celebration. I covered it. I was there for it.
 I'll never forget that. And for everyone else who was there, I encourage you never to let go of that memory either.
 You were there.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Charging that Iran was "fully responsible" for an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq, President Donald Trump ordered about 750 U.S. soldiers deployed to the Middle East as about 3,000 more prepared for possible deployment in the next several days.   No U.S. casualties or evacuations were reported after the attack Tuesday by dozens of Iran-supported militiamen. U.S. Marines were sent from Kuwait to reinforce the compound.   Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Tuesday night that "in response to recent events" in Iraq, and at Trump's direction, he authorized the immediate deployment of the infantry battalion from the Army's 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He did not specify the soldiers' destination, but a U.S. official familiar with the decision said they will go to Kuwait.   "This deployment is an appropriate and precautionary action taken in response to increased threat levels against U.S. personnel and facilities, such as we witnessed in Baghdad today," Esper said in a written statement.   Additional soldiers from the 82nd Airborne's quick-deployment brigade, known officially as its Immediate Response Force, were prepared to deploy, Esper said. The U.S. official, who provided unreleased details on condition of anonymity, said the full brigade of about 4,000 soldiers may deploy.   The 750 soldiers deploying immediately were in addition to 14,000 U.S. troops who had deployed to the Gulf region since May in response to concerns about Iranian aggression, including its alleged sabotage of commercial shipping in the Persian Gulf. At the time of the attack the U.S. had about 5,200 troops in Iraq, mainly to train Iraqi forces and help them combat Islamic State extremists.   The breach of the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad on Tuesday was a stark demonstration that Iran can still strike at American interests despite Trump's economic pressure campaign. It also revealed growing strains between Washington and Baghdad, raising questions about the future of the U.S. military mission there.   "They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat. Happy New Year!" Trump tweeted Tuesday afternoon, though it was unclear whether his "threat" meant military retaliation. He thanked top Iraqi government leaders for their "rapid response upon request."   American airstrikes on Sunday killed 25 fighters of an Iran-backed militia in Iraq, the Kataeb Hezbollah. The U.S. said those strikes were in retaliation for last week's killing of an American contractor and the wounding of American and Iraqi troops in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base that the U.S. blamed on the militia. The American strikes angered the Iraqi government, which called them an unjustified violation of its sovereignty.   While blaming Iran for the embassy breach, Trump also called on Iraq to protect the diplomatic mission.   "Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many," he tweeted from his estate in Florida. "We strongly responded, and always will. Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible. In addition, we expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the Embassy, and so notified!"   Even as Trump has argued for removing U.S. troops from Mideast conflicts, he also has singled out Iran as a malign influence in the region. After withdrawing the U.S. in 2018 from an international agreement that exchanged an easing of sanctions for curbs on Iran's nuclear program, Trump ratcheted up sanctions.   Those economic penalties, including a virtual shut-off of Iranian oil exports, are aimed at forcing Iran to negotiate a broader nuclear deal. But critics say that pressure has pushed Iranian leaders into countering with a variety of military attacks in the Gulf.   Until Sunday's U.S. airstrikes, Trump had been measured in his response to Iranian provocations. In June, he abruptly called off U.S. military strikes on Iranian targets in retaliation for the downing of an American drone.   Robert Ford, a retired U.S. diplomat who served five years in Baghdad and then became ambassador in Syria, said Iran's allies in the Iraqi parliament may be able to harness any surge in anger among Iraqis toward the United States to force U.S. troops to leave the country. Ford said Trump miscalculated by approving Sunday's airstrikes on Kataeb Hezbollah positions in Iraq and Syria -- strikes that drew a public rebuke from the Iraqi government and seem to have triggered Tuesday's embassy attack.   "The Americans fell into the Iranian trap," Ford said, with airstrikes that turned some Iraqi anger toward the U.S. and away from Iran and the increasingly unpopular Iranian-backed Shiite militias.   The tense situation in Baghdad appeared to upset Trump's vacation routine in Florida, where he is spending the holidays.   Trump spent just under an hour at his private golf club in West Palm Beach before returning to his Mar-a-Lago resort in nearby Palm Beach. He had spent nearly six hours at his golf club on each of the previous two days. Trump spoke with Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi and emphasized the need for Iraq to protect Americans and their facilities in the country, said White House spokesman Hogan Gidley.   Trump is under pressure from some in Congress to take a hard-line approach to Iranian aggression, which the United States says included an unprecedented drone and missile attack on the heart of Saudi Arabia's oil industry in September. More recently, Iran-backed militias in Iraq have conducted numerous rocket attacks on bases hosting U.S. forces.   Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican and supporter of Trump's Iran policy, called the embassy breach "yet another reckless escalation" by Iran.   Tuesday's attack was carried out by members of the Iran-supported Kataeb Hezbollah militia. Dozens of militiamen and their supporters smashed a main door to the compound and set fire to a reception area, but they did not enter the main buildings.   Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, blamed Iran for the episode and faulted Trump for his "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran.   "The results so far have been more threats against international commerce, emboldened and more violent proxy attacks across the Middle East, and now, the death of an American citizen in Iraq," Menendez said, referring to the rocket attack last week.   By early evening Tuesday, the mob had retreated from the compound but set up several tents outside for an intended sit-in. Dozens of yellow flags belonging to Iran-backed Shiite militias fluttered atop the reception area and were plastered along the embassy's concrete wall along with anti-U.S. graffiti. American Apache helicopters flew overhead and dropped flares over the area in what the U.S. military called a "show of force."   The embassy breach was seen by some analysts as affirming their view that it is folly for the U.S. to keep forces in Iraq after having eliminated the Islamic State group's territorial hold in the country.   A U.S. withdrawal from Iraq is also a long-term hope of Iran, noted Paul Salem, president of the Washington-based Middle East Institute.   And it's always possible Trump would "wake up one morning and make that decision" to pull U.S. forces out of Iraq, as he announced earlier with the U.S. military presence in neighboring Syria, Salem said. Trump's Syria decision triggered the resignation of his first defense secretary, retired Gen. Jim Mattis, but the president later amended his decision and about 1,200 U.S. troops remain in Syria.   Trump's best weapon with Iran is the one he's already using -- the sanctions, said Salem. He and Ford said Trump would do best to keep resisting Iran's attempt to turn the Iran-U.S. conflict into a full-blown military one. The administration should also make a point of working with the Iraqi government to deal with the militias, Ford said.   For the president, Iran's attacks -- directly and now through proxies in Iraq -- have "been working that nerve," Salem said. "Now they really have Trump's attention."   ___   Associated Press writers Matthew Lee, Darlene Superville and Sagar Meghani contributed to this report.

Multiple sources told these reporters that they found it puzzling that a restaurant that had no more than 10 guests each night could manage to remain in business for so long. One of our sources recalled how his children were hosted to a tour of the restaurant and it's wooden oven by the mafia boss that runs the place.

 Florence utilizing extra tax revenue
 Florence has used a 1-cent sales tax increase that began in March for various programs, as well as pay raises. The new rate is 9.5% in Florence, with 3.5% going to the city.
 The City Council approved the increase and expected some $1.4 million of it to go toward pay raises for police and firefighters to help bring salaries in line with those at regional cities of similar size. They later increased pay for upper-level members of the departments, as well.
 Improvements to Veterans Park including refurbished tennis courts, playground equipment and clearing work that helped enhance the view to the Tennessee River were among projects. Additional upgrades have been made to city parks, including tennis courts.
 The sale tax increase generated just under $5 million from March through the end of the fiscal year in September, and the city used it all, Holt said.
 "We were able to cover everything we were set to cover with the increase," he said.
 "My priority has been to take all of our buildings and facilities in all of our departments and have them maintained and updated so that we're in good shape physically. We got a really good start on it, with the museums and parks. We thought those were the most pressing."
 Work has started on Station 1 at Florence Fire Rescue, as well as the first floor of the Police Department.
 The Station 1 work, including the roof, is expected to cost about $550,000. The police station likely will cost about $275,000.
 The River Heritage Trail along the Tennessee River and an additional streetscape phase are among projects on board for 2020, Holt said. The $2,885,824 contract for the project with Joe Keenum Excavation and Construction Inc. calls for 300 working days
 "We should start the streetscape in January," Holt said. "That would finish up the next two blocks of Tennessee Street, then to Cherry Street, down to College Street and from College over to Poplar Street and back up. That's a rather extensive project.
 "The other big one is the river walk. It's ready to go out to bid."
 Officials have estimated the cost of the River Heritage project at $4.1 million.
 Florence will continue a paving program that involved $1.5 million worth of work in 2019, Holt said. He said the city ranks its paving needs on streets on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the highest need.
 "We got all of our 10s," he said. "We'll start on the 9s this year."
 He said they will dedicate $2 million toward the 2020 paving program.
 A project of more than $1.5 million will go toward improvements to the sewer structure and manholes along Alabama Street.
 Florence also is working with the Alabama Department of Transportation on Rickwood Road improvements, from Helton Drive to Chisholm Road.
 "It's scheduled to be bid in September," Holt said. "That is definitely needed. It's a rough stretch. It's taking us longer than usual because of being able obtain right of way. We've just got to get all of that worked out and it takes some time."
 The mayor said maintenance and upgrades to city properties will continue.
 "By end of the fiscal year we hope to start looking at the next fire station to renovate, and the upper level of the Police Department," he said. "We'll continue renovations and maintenance on our parks."
 Holt said he wants the city also to explore ways to increase bandwidth and high-speed fiber lines.
 "We want to make sure we are competitive with everybody else in the years to come," he said.
 Breaking ground on Inspiration Landing
 While Sheffield Mayor Ian Sanford said he is not seeking reelection in 2020, he does want to see one major project started during his administration come to fruition next year.
 It's been four years since Germantown, Tennessee, developer John Elkington revealed his plans for the music themed Inspiration Landing project to a packed city hall auditorium.
 At long last, it appears groundbreaking should be happening sometime after the new year.
 "I think we're going to see a considerable amount of work," Sanford said. "I'm just thankful John Elkington didn't walk away from the project."
 For the coming year, the mayor said downtown buildings continue to be renovated, including a bed and breakfast on Montgomery Avenue. Two buildings, including the Fox A-1 Plumbing Inc. building on Montgomery Avenue, have been sold.
 He tells those who comment about how well downtown look that they need to support those businesses.
 "We look forward to a good year," Sanford said. "I really think 2020 will be a good year for Sheffield and a good year for the Shoals."

 That should be obvious to everyone. A broad understanding of Horizon’s plans and public support for them aren’t possible by this legislative session’s Jan. 14 deadline.
 New Jersey granted Horizon a unique position in the health insurance market, obligating it to the public but also allowing it to grow into an industry giant with annual revenue in excess of $3 billion.
 The proper response to several past failures to convert to for-profit status is not a political rush job, but a sounder, more convincing case for why a change in structure would benefit New Jersey residents.

SUMMERVILLE -- "It's kind of a contradiction, isn't it? That we're the friendliest city and have the most (domestic violence) murders," she said. "We're all polite to strangers, but we take it out on the people we're closest to."
   
 Having survived an abusive relationship with a man who'd go on to become a domestic killer, she said, made the numbers more real.
   
 A year after the slaying, with her abuser behind bars and her fear beginning to subside, Lynn Reilly is ready to help other domestic violence survivors join her in the healing process.
   
 She could have used a place like My Sister's House, a Charleston-area domestic violence shelter and resource center.
   
 Reilly met her husband when they were in middle school, she said, and they married in their 20s. She fought back the first time he hit her, she said, which just made him more vicious in later attacks.
   
 The first time she tried to leave her abusive husband, Reilly remembers, she struggled to find a way out. One day she managed to slip out of the house and use a friend's phone to dial a shelter, worried all the while that she'd be caught.
   
 But without money, transportation or a phone of her own, she couldn't make it to the address they gave her.
   
 "I would've left that day," she said.
   
 Instead, the abuse continued. Her husband starved her, shattered her jaw, broke into her father's house and left her covered in bruises, she said. When he went to jail, he'd leave messages on the answering machine promising to kill her upon his release.
   
 It'd be years before she'd stand up to tell a stranger her story. By then, the tale would include years of abuse, a difficult escape, and her abuser slaying his new partner.
   
 In October 2018, her fears came true. Her ex-husband ignored a protective order, barged into his ex's home and murdered his former partner, police said. But Reilly wasn't the victim.
   
 After their divorce, he dated a man whom he was convicted of threatening in June 2018, according to court records. He pleaded guilty, served 30 days in jail and was prohibited from threatening the victim again.
   
 But after his release he went to his ex's home and stabbed him several times, police said. According to police records, Reilly's ex-husband told officers "I hope he dies" and "I got him as many times as I could."
   
 In shock, Reilly traveled up the coast to meet investigators and see for herself that, finally, the man who'd haunted her for so long was behind bars.
   
 The news brought waves of guilt and relief, she said. For the first time since she left him, she felt safe knowing he couldn't track her down. But why had a man who'd already been convicted of abusing her and threatening another been allowed to carry through with his threats?
   
 Reilly said it's sometimes overwhelming to think of how narrowly she escaped that fate. After she divorced, she said, he told her he'd kept track of the times he tried to kill her: 459.
   
 After several years in South Carolina, she got the number tattooed on the back of her right wrist, a reminder of the strength that kept her going. Should she ever begin to give into suicidal thoughts and turn her wrist to pour too many pills into her right palm, she knows the number will give her pause. She's thwarted 459 attempts on her life, and doesn't plan to throw away all that she's fought for.
   
 "It's not a reminder of what he did," she said. "It's a reminder that life is precious."
   
 Reilly can think of a dozen laws and standards that would make her feel confident in survivors' chances of escaping their abusers, but what she needed to break free was understanding.
   
 It was a therapist who introduced Reilly to My Sister's House, encouraging her to attend the survivors' support groups. She did, and loved it, but it would be months before she could see herself in the role of the women who'd helped her. She was still too angry, she said.
   
 That's common for survivors who want to give back, volunteer coordinator Amber Cook said. About 60 percent of the shelter's volunteers have pulled through abuse themselves.
   
 "But it fixes my soul," Reilly said. "(It) helps me to help someone else."
   
 Now she helps watch children at the shelter, volunteers at events and serves on a committee of other survivors.
   
 Along the way, she's gotten more comfortable telling her story. When Medical University of South Carolina officials closed out Domestic Violence Awareness Month with an Oct. 30 rally, she agreed to be the keynote speaker.
   
 "It's not about my story anymore," she said. "It's about fixing this for all of us."
