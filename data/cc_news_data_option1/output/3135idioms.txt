I’ll basically just skip burying the lead this time around and just discuss my top ten a bit here now. To me, the best winner of this category so far to date has been Diane Keaton in her iconic performance in Annie Hall. She creates an unforgettable character alongside Woody Allen and wins both your heart and your mind. It’s unquestionably the best winner in this category’s history, at least in my eyes. A classic performance in a classic film. Not far behind is Hilary Swank in Boys Don’t Cry, which I think is not just one of the all time best bits of acting, but somehow an underrated one despite winning Swank her first Oscar. Swank actually has two performances in my top ten (and she’s not the only multiple honoree here, but I’ll get to that in a moment), but this is her crowning achievement. Rounding out the top five we have Jodie Foster in The Silence of the Lambs (who has two performances on my list), Elizabeth Taylor for Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, and Charlize Theron for Monster. They’re all tremendous performances, and they’re joined in an absolutely stacked top ten by the likes of Louise Fletcher for One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, Vivien Leigh for Gone with the Wind, Natalie Portman for Black Swan, Meryl Streep for Sophie’s Choice, and Swank again for Million Dollar Baby. Besides Swank’s two mentions, Foster also shows up again just outside the top ten for The Accused, while Leigh has one more in the top 20 with A Streetcar Named Desire (Frances McDormand also makes two appearances on the list as well). This is the sort of category where you easily could have gone 50 deep and still had to exclude some worthy winners, so the 25 ladies cited here are all totally top notch. There’s not a lesser choice in the lot, believe me there.

Before we take your questions, let me briefly recap, we exited the first quarter with $730 million in cash and short-term investments on our balance sheet. We have drawn down $100 million against our credit facility and have access to the remaining balance of $400 million. We have no bonds coming due until October 2021. We are also taking actions within our capital structure and across the business to preserve cash during this time. As I mentioned at the onset of my remarks, based on the level of uncertainty around the depth and duration of COVID-19 in addition to the impact of each of our businesses, we are suspending guidance for the current financial year. We are monitoring operations, metrics and trends on a daily basis in order to take the appropriate actions in a timely manner.

Let me give it a try on your question about volume and cost profit dynamic. And I'm not sure if I got the core of the question, but let me give it a try or we follow-up. In the second quarter, we saw weak volume demand, and we do have volume declines relative to previous year of high single-digit or low double-digit. Gross profit was, I'm using rounded figures, virtually flat. So how did we manage to achieve the gross profit per unit increases? It's partly a mix effect. In these times and times with weakening demand, it's typical that the low-margin bulk, full truckload business goes away first. But the small quantity, less-than-truckload repeat order business remains. The latter is the, by far, higher-margin business. So there is a mix effect.

We should hardly be surprised at this acceptance of death as inevitable. For years, conservatives have responded to gun violence with angry renunciations of any links to gun proliferation or lax gun control laws, offering instead "thoughts and prayers." The one exception where Republicans express outrage is over the "death" of fetal cells inside women's bodies—indicating that the fight is less about "murder," as the anti-abortionists like to call it, than it is about controlling women's bodies. By and large, the nation's right-wing factions have for years wanted us to accept mass deaths and preventable mortality as a price for our "freedom." They expect the same during a pandemic.

Yes, I mean, number of parcels is the -- still the ultimate measure of getting to profitability. Underneath that, as Stan mentioned, the mix of the kind of parcels is becoming increasingly more important. So we have kind of a sweet spot in terms of volume for our network, it tends to be smaller parcels, but not too small. So there are six or seven different metrics, but far and away the most important one is the number of parcels. But embedded in that a lot of productivity measures within the distribution centers and as Stan mentioned, because of things like temperature checks, social distancing, moving volume around and candidly we had two sites that we brought online, and we still have the old site and in the first quarter. So there is a lot of moving pieces in the quarter. But we expect the profitability of that business to continue to improve this year and I'm still very optimistic.

We've also leveraged and taken management tax reform to repatriate cash.

Like everyone else, we're going to feel the effects of COVID-19, but everything we've done for the last several years to strengthen our balance sheet, to strengthen our portfolio, to reposition this business, put us in a much better place, to weather the storm and our focus is to fulfill our roles in the central business and do the necessary things on a daily basis to continue to move mail, move parcels, finance small businesses, but importantly to come out of this crisis even stronger than before.

So let me start with the last question. I certainly expect the second quarter to be more challenged in the first. In terms of how the rest of the year unfolds, your guess is as good as mine, a lot of it depends on the states opening up and how the virus is able to be contained. So as we do our internal modeling, we do think the second quarter is a trough. But that's precisely the reason we suspended guidance, is our ability to give responsible guidance at this point as well.

Rory, it’s Georg. It is a standard element of chemical distribution that on the one hand, price volatility is helpful to distributors. But it's also an element of chemical distribution, that if volumes fall to a degree and service level becomes more important, so smaller volume deliveries, reliable customers are better paid and that 20 [Indiscernible] volumes pick up again. So it's always a scale that at the end of the day nets out reasonably.

  # Jaguars HC Doug Marrone Sees Gardner Minshew II As a Player 'On a Mission'


  John Shipley


  2 minutes ago


 ! 


  For any football team, no other player needs to command more respect from those within the team than the starting quarterback. They are the leaders of not just the offense, but of the entire team in most cases. They should be looked to as an example of how to the right things in the best circumstances.


  Luckily for the Jacksonville Jaguars, that appears to be just what they are getting in second-year quarterback Gardner Minshew II thus far.


  The Jaguars already knew they had a fiery, intelligent and hard-working player in Minshew after he appeared in 14 games as a rookie. The sixth-round backup stepped into the huddle when Nick Foles went down with an injury in the first quarter of Week 1, and he never looked back, leading Jacksonville to six wins.


  Thanks to his entertaining play style and off-field charisma, Minshew developed a following that has seen him become one of the league's most interesting signal-callers. But while his quirky interviews and fashion choices may be what grabs headlines, it has so far been his mindset and actions on and off the field that have caught the eyes of the Jaguars.


  "I see the guy that comes in with a mission and a focus every single day. When he’s here or around myself, not to say that we might not laugh about something or joke, we do, but I don’t see that other side that people say about the quirkiness or things of that nature," head coach Doug Marrone said during a video press conference on Thursday.


  "Maybe I bring that out in people, I don’t know. I’m just saying I see a guy that’s focused and he’s ready to go and every time he’s here and he’s working, he’s on a mission and he’s really working with his teammates."


  Marrone continued to say that while Minshew does have a good personality which can draw people to him, it is the way he carries himself around the team and on the field that especially catch his eye. Considering Minshew is entering just his second pro season and his first season as a full-time starter, it is likely encouraging for Marrone his Minshew is quarterback who is working hard to continue to get better.


  "I say that he’s someone that has a really good personality and can laugh at himself and do those things, which I think is important in life. I think that he’s someone that can communicate with everyone on his team no matter where you are or whether you’re the guy that stays in the corner or whether you’re out there. And I think that’s great. Those things are positive," Marrone said.


  "Make no mistake about it, when he crosses that line and he’s on the field or he’s in the classroom or when he’s by himself, he’s working extremely hard. That’s what I see.”


  Marrone wasn't the only one who gave Minshew a glowing review in terms of his leadership and want-to, either. Center Brandon Linder has been a captain for the Jaguars' offense and no other player on the offense has been with the franchise as long as he has. His opinion carries weight in TIAA Bank Field, and earning the center's respect is important for any quarterback.


  For Linder, Minshew showed last year why he commands respect when he steps onto the field. He took his job and role on the team seriously as a rookie, he noted, helping him earn the praise of his coaches and teammates.


  "What happened to Nick Foles was unfortunate, a freak injury. Then, this rookie steps in and I don’t know his stats that game, but it was pretty remarkable, his attempts and completions but as the weeks went on he wasn’t a rookie anymore," Linder said Wednesday. "He came to play every game. He had a look in his eye, and everyone admired that and got behind that.”

Yes. Thanks for the question. We don't really want to go too much into nitty- gritty kind of trading, but trying to be helpful. Nevertheless, I referenced a little bit earlier that a very typical mechanically chemical distribution is that gross profit per unit and volumes lead against each other. So when one is particularly weak, the other is particularly strong. In that sense, going forward, I would always expect the scale to balance out between the two items to a degree, I believe. I cannot say that we have seen a super material change in dynamic in course of the quarter or after. So every movement we have seen is still in the noise -- or in the ballpark, of obviously high level of uncertainty that the world currently has.
