¿Eres capaz de diferenciar una imagen real de un videojuego? Parece mentira que la tecnología del videojuego haya evolucionado tanto en los últimos 30 años que hayamos pasado de imágenes 2D en píxeles, a imágenes 3D fotorrealistas. En la actualidad, con los gráficos de PS5 y Xbox Series X que se estrenarán a finales de año, los desarrolladores han logrado recrear mundos que bien podrían ser reales. Obviamente un experto generalmente sabe diferenciar un videojuego de una imagen real, especialmente cuando hablamos de un vídeo, aunque ciertos juegos logran confundir a muchas personas. Juegos de simulación, como los centrados en pilotar aviones o conducir coches, pueden llegar a confundir a los ojos poco expertos. Sin embargo, es cierto que en la época de PS3 los gráficos generalmente no se mostraban tan pulidos y era más fácil diferenciar una imagen real de una que estaba generada por ordenador. ¿Seguro que sabrías diferenciarlas? Quizás te replantees esta afirmación cuando veas el siguiente viral que se ha hecho famoso en las redes. Cuando pensamos en gráficos que ya no son realistas, sin duda pensamos en videojuegos para PS2 o PS3, consolas que ya quedan lejos en cuanto a tecnología punta. Sin embargo, como demostró recientemente el usuario japonés de Twitter @BristolShubun, a veces la vida real sí tiene cierto parecido con los gráficos 3D rudimentarios de dichos sistemas de Sony. ¿Fotografía real o imagen de ordenador? "Mi perro parece una imagen con Photoshop", tuiteó @BristolShubun con una foto de su perro, generando dudas sobre su veracidad en las redes. Parece un videojuego, desde luego, pero asegura que se trata de una imagen real. Quizás estemos ante el efecto de "Origen", la película de Nolan en la que explican que una simple idea de nuestro subconsciente es capaz de hacernos cambiar nuestra opinión y nuestra realidad. Si creamos la duda sobre una imagen, en este caso de un perro, quizás veamos gráficos de consola en una imagen completamente real (aunque con una paleta de colores curiosa). Algunos comentaristas en las redes sociales no pudieron evitar señalar que el perro de la especie shiba se parece más a una mascota de un videojuego que a una mascota de la vida real. Incluso algunos han decidido colocar sobre la foto los típicos cuadros de diálogo de los videojuegos. Ahora te toca a ti, ¿fotografía real o imagen de ordenador?

Moving up from the physical, MIDI operates at 31250 baud. This value has often frustrated users since it is, to say the least, uncommon to find it implemented outside of MIDI. In actuality, its origins make perfect sense. The first MIDI implementations commonly used the outstanding Intel 8051 microcontroller. The 8051, at least in 1982, used an external XTAL oscillator with 12MHz as the fastest supported value. Internally, it divided that signal by 12 to derive a 1MHZ timer clock. If you divide 1MHz by 32 (2⁵), you get 31,250!

En el gabinete nuestro hay libertad, hay discrepancias y no hay pensamiento unico. Se da la libertad para que todos opinen, dijo el presidente en rueda de prensa desde el estado de Sinaloa, donde revelo que Toledo tampoco le ha presentado la dimision. El presidente manifesto que la existencia de discrepancias en un Gobierno es normal y recordo que el presidente Benito Juarez (1858-1872), su gran referente, tuvo unos 10 o 15 secretarios de Hacienda. Busco siempre armonizar, escuchar a todos, darle la razon al que la tiene y decido en funcion de lo que conviene mas al pueblo, explico sobre las diferencias dentro del Ejecutivo. Se filtran audios de Victor Toledo, sectretario de Medio Ambiente El secretario (ministro) de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales de Mexico, Victor Toledo, cuestiono la politica ambiental del Gobierno presidido por Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador al denunciar contradicciones en el gabinete. En un audio filtrado este miercoles a medios de una reunion virtual de la Secretaria del Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (Semarnat), Toledo critico a la Secretaria de Energia (Sener), la de Agricultura y Desarrollo Rural (Sader) y al jefe de la Oficina de la Presidencia, Alfonso Romo. No tenemos a la Sener porque tambien hay diferencias con la secretaria Rocio Nahle, entonces a lo que quiero llegar es que estamos haciendo un esfuerzo desde Semarnat, pero no estamos en un Gobierno totalmente de lado nuestro. Adentro hay contradicciones muy fuertes, afirmo el funcionario. La difusion del audio ocurre dos semanas despues de la renuncia de Javier Jimenez Espriu a la secretaria de Comunicaciones y Transportes (SCT), por diferencias con la militarizacion de los puertos y aduanas promovida por Lopez Obrador. Antes de el, hace un año, renunciaron el entonces secretario de Hacienda y Credito Publico, Carlos Urzua, y el director del Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), German Martinez, ambos por discrepancias politicas. Toledo reemplazo el año pasado a Josefa Gonzalez Blanco, quien renuncio a la Semarnat tras protagonizar un escandalo en el que retraso la salida de un vuelo comercial que abordo. El actual secretario cuestiono la gobernanza de la 4T, como se llama en Mexico a la administracion de Lopez Obrador por buscar la Cuarta Transformacion de la historia del pais. Efectivamente la 4T, como tal, como un conjunto claro y acabado de objetivos, no existe. Por el contrario, este gobierno de la 4T esta lleno de contradicciones y estas se expresan concretamente en luchas de poder al interior del gabinete, manifesto el funcionario. En el audio, Toledo destaco su conflicto con el Victor Villalobos, titular de la Sader, por el uso del glifosato como herbicida, el algodon transgenico y la agroecologia. Asimismo, apunto al jefe de la Oficina de la Presidencia, Alfonso Romo, a quien tambien han acusado exfuncionarios del Gobierno de promover sus intereses. Es el operador principal para bloquear todo lo que efectivamente sea, digamos, en la linea de lo ambiental, de la transicion energetica, de la agroecologia, todo el tiempo, denuncio Toledo. El secretario tambien lamento el presunto cabildeo que hizo la titular de la Secretaria de Gobernacion (Segob), Olga Sanchez Cordero, en favor de la planta cervecera de Constellation Brands en Mexicali, y el del titular de la Subsecretaria de Mineria de la Secretaria de Economia, Francisco Quiroga, para reducir el escrutinio a estas empresas. Por ello, el funcionario sugirio a sus colaboradores encontrar un plan B para promover sus objetivos ecologicos. Toda nuestra vision, que aqui la compartimos bajo todos nosotros, no esta para nada en el resto del gabinete y me temo que tampoco esta en la cabeza del presidente, entonces hay que decirlo, entonces por lo tanto los quiero poner en la realidad como es, concluyo.

Premier League clubs voted against continuing to allow five substitutes for the 2020-’21 season on Thursday.
 Following the resumption of the 2019-’20 campaign after the coronavirus shutdown, clubs were allowed to name nine substitutes and make five changes during matches to support player welfare.
 Some clubs wanted the new regulation carried over but the Premier League confirmed they were voted down at Thursday’s annual general meeting, held virtually.
 All 20 members also backed changes to the video assistant referee as the system is to fall in line with Fifa protocol.
 “At the Premier League’s annual general meeting today, shareholders agreed to rules relating to VAR and substitute players for the 2020/21 season,” the statement said.
 “Shareholders unanimously approved the implementation of VAR, in line with the full FIFA VAR protocol.
 “Clubs also agreed to revert back to using up to three substitute players per match, with a maximum of seven substitutes on the bench.”
 The VAR changes come as Fifa aims to have a unified approach to its implementation.
 There was controversy in several Premier League games during the season, with the new protocols agreed upon unanimously.
 The changes will see referees use the pitch-side review area more often, with the Premier League now also using VAR to spot goalkeeper encroachment on penalties, while assistant referees have been told to keep their flag down for marginal offside calls until the attacking move has played out.

The power of recall and impeachment becomes potent. Representation assumes the right complexion of people’s expectations. Objective representation becomes the order of the day. Furthermore, the urge to satisfy godfathers’ insatiable appetite is reduced, if not eliminated, as the people now become the power base apart from enhancing the country’s democracy. In fact, I reckon that internal control mechanisms in terms of checks and balances between the executive and the legislature would take pride of place where politicians can debate issues outside the confines of political party’s prisms of interests and maintain fidelity to the interests of the masses who elected them. Legislatures cease to be rubber stamp and the executive becomes upright. The nation tends to gain more than the dividends purportedly obtainable now. It is against this background that the efforts in the enthronement of independent candidature so far made by the National Assembly is appreciated. I had the privilege, amongst others, of serving as a legal consultant during the Eighth Assembly in the constitutional amendment process by which I know that the proposed bill scaled through both Houses but suffered a set back at the presidential level for technical reasons. It is hoped that the resurrection of this noble idea by the Ninth Assembly will bear fruit in time. That we must curtail the excesses of the political parties is a task that must be achieved urgently. The ‘cut-and-paste political parties’ existing in Nigeria must be tamed in our collective interest.

In Nigeria, we cannot assert the existence of ideology in virtually all of the political parties. I find it difficult to ascertain the political ideology of any of the political parties in Nigeria. They all virtually possess the same ideas in terms of the statements in their manifestoes and the constitutions. That gave me the idea of their being ‘cut and paste political parties’. All that are mostly done is to substitute the names and addresses in the existing political party documents for a new one; no ingenuity or value added. A political party is supposed to be a conglomeration of people with similar beliefs and convictions. The frequent cross-carpeting that takes place in the nation’s political space attests to this lack of ideology in the political parties. Since there is no affinity between those politicians and the political parties in terms of ideology, they easily move from one political party to the other as a matter of convenience. Latest in the series is that of the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Yakubu Dogara. One wonders if there is any justification for his decamping from his erstwhile political party to the ruling one. For a politician holding a public office to decamp from one political party to another requires some objective conditions necessitating such a move. It is true that the law does not forbid such cross- carpeting but there must be a huge division or factionalisation in his political party at the national level by which such a party cannot be considered as one political platform again before a politician holding a public office can lawfully decamp to another party. This was established as a rule by the Supreme Court in the case of Senator Mohammed Goni who, close to the end of his tenure as the elected the Governor of Borno State, decamped from Great Nigeria People’s Party (GNPP) on which platform he was elected to Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN) in 1983. However, these days, politicians decamp from one political party to another without any justification or any condition warranting same save for personal convenience. It is an evidence of lack of faith in or lack of existence of any political ideology for which a political party ought to be identified.

"The lads saw him as someone they wanted in the trenches with them, so he established himself as a leader very early on and went from strength to strength from there."
 When it was announced in June that Clarke would be leaving the club, the reaction from the supporters but even more-so the players was emphatic.
 Players who had played with the No.5 for only a few months hailed him as the best captain they'd ever played under - North End were saying goodbye to a hugely popular figure.
 Welsh was vice-captain to 'Skip' and gave an insight into what made him so well-liked and appreciated.
 "He was just a player that really cared, on and off the pitch," Welsh continued. "His qualities off it though, if there was anyone I needed to speak to then Tom would certainly be top of my list, if I had any problem or felt a certain way.
 "Anyone who needed something sorting, they would go and see Clarkey.
 "I still keep in touch with him now, we're doing our UEFA B license together.
 "He was massive in the dressing room and was sort of a quiet captain, who wore his heart on his sleeve - there was a lot like that at Preston but you'd have to put him at the top.
 "The way he conducted himself off the pitch, he would sort anything for anyone and he was a natural-born leader.
 "When he left, the messages that went up, you saw just how much respect people had for him."
 Earlier this season, Tom Barkhuizen insisted that the defender would be the one person he'd want lined up next to him if PNE ever reached a play-off final.
 Largely due to injuries, Clarke only managed 11 appearances last season, but Alex Neil still turned to his skipper in those games where North End needed to stand up and be counted.
