But none of the studios studied — the Walt Disney Co., Warner Bros., Universal Pictures, Lionsgate, Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures, STX Films and United Artists Releasing — received a "good" or higher grade for LGBTQ representation. Sony and Disney received "poor" grades. STX Films, which released "Hustlers," "21 Bridges" and "Uglydolls" last year, failed GLAAD's test since their 2019 movies featured zero LGBTQ representation.
 GLAAD has sought that studios reach inclusion of LGBTQ characters in 20% of their films by 2021 and 50% by 2024. Paramount, Lionsgate, Disney and United Artists reached the 20% level last year.
 Screen time is also an issue. In many of Hollywood's biggest films, LGBTQ characters — when included — came and went. Only nine of the 22 films with an LGBTQ character featured one with more than 10 minutes of screen time.
 "Despite seeing a record high percentage of LGBTQ-inclusive films this year, the industry still has a long way to go in terms of fairly and accurately representing the LGBTQ community," said GLAAD President and CEO, Sarah Kate Ellis. "If film studios want to stay relevant to today's audiences and compete in an industry that is emphasizing diversity and inclusion, then they must urgently reverse course on the diminishing representation of LGBTQ women and people of color, as well as the complete absence of trans characters."

Helen Mary Elizabeth Costello Daly      Helen Mary Elizabeth Costello Daly passed away peacefully after a courageous battle with chronic respiratory disease on Wednesday, July 15, 2020 at Morristown Medical Center. She had shared 77 years of unconditional love, priceless memories, and contagious laughter with family and friends.      Born and raised in New Rochelle, NY to the late Cornelius and Jane Costello, she was one of two children to bless the Costello household. After graduating from St. Gabriel's High School, Class of 1960, she graduated from Claremont Secretarial School in NYC. This launched her into her first career with Trans World Airlines where Helen successfully worked her way up to Senior Benefits Supervisor before retiring after 25 years of service. Her next career was with Guardian Life Insurance Company in Manhattan in which she dedicated another 25 years of service, retiring officially in 2010 as their Director of Corporate Benefits. A committed student of life and knowledge, Helen took adult education classes in History at New York University. She married Dennis Francis Daly on February 24, 1968; he blessed her with a daughter whom she raised in New Rochelle, NY. A devout Catholic, she was an active member of the Blessed Sacrament Parish in New Rochelle. A lifelong New Rochelle resident, Helen moved to NJ in 2018 to be closer to her daughter and grandson and settled into the Fox Briar section of Rockaway. She quickly became a member of St. Mary's Church in Denville and found a new church family that welcomed her with open arms. Every Sunday after Mass, her and her friends would chat for a while in the narthex and she became a vital member of their Prayer Shawl Ministry.      It is impossible to put into words the generous and compassionate woman that she was. Always making the best out of every situation, Helen truly made delicious lemonade out of sour lemons. This breast cancer survivor is our hero, mother, "Gamma", sister, best friend, and confidant. She was excellent at knitting and making all kinds of crafts, her most recent hobby was making dollhouses. Helen was a true "City Gal" who took great pleasure in walking the streets of the Big Apple and saw many Broadway shows. A perennial traveler, she relished every moment spent in Rome, Paris, Cape May, Florida, and especially enjoyed her trips to Long Island Sound and Glen Island Park where she was able to talk long walks along the shoreline. Being by the water was definitely her happy place, so be sure to say hi to her the next time you find yourself staring into the mesmerizing water with your toes in sand, knowing she is shining down sharing the beautiful view with you from her heavenly vantage point. Above anything else, her family was her pride and joy. Although we are deeply saddened by her passing, we take comfort in knowing she is out of pain and reunited with her parents.      She leaves only joyful memories to her adored daughter and son-in-law, Kellie Daly Siino and Anthony Siino; her treasured grandson, Kyle Siino; her cherished sister, Nancy Costello and her husband Victor Stamboulian; and many more extended family and friends.      Mass of Christian Burial will be held on Monday, July 20th at 10 am at St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church, 15 Myers Avenue, Denville. Burial will follow at Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in New Rochelle, NY. Relatives and friends are invited to visit with her family on Sunday, July 19th from 2 - 5 pm at Norman Dean Home for Services, 16 Righter Avenue, Denville. Due to current restrictions on allowable numbers inside the funeral home, it is requested that those attending the visitation be courteous by limiting their time inside in order to allow others the opportunity to pay their respects as well. Memorial Donations in Helen's name are being accepted by way of www.inmemof.org to the Humane Society or Best Friends Animal Society, two organizations near and dear to heart as she was devoted to her many cats throughout the years. Please leave a condolence, light a candle, and share your favorite memory of Helen at www.normandean.com to continue to celebrate the amazing life she endowed with us.

It was difficult to know what I would encounter when I stepped back onto an Air New Zealand flight from Brisbane on a plane that was at best only 10% full.
 In the month I was in Queensland, events on both sides of the Tasman got worse rather than better. I read of the handful of "detainees" who had absconded from quarantine facilities in New Zealand and the resulting beef-up of security. The day I flew out Victoria was a mess with a second wave of the virus sweeping the state like some invisible tsunami.
 We were one of only three flights leaving Brisbane that day. One was going to Doha and the other somewhere that now slips my mind. The airport, empty of the excited cacophony of travellers on holiday or returning home, was surreal and sobering.
 The atmosphere on the plane was sombre. Those on board were almost exclusively New Zealanders returning home. You didn't need to see their full faces (masks were compulsory the whole time except for eating) to read the anxiety. It was in everyone's eyes.
 I am not necessarily a sentimental or melancholy person but the little moments of kindness along the way helped. The woman at the airport whose mask couldn't hide her cheery disposition in welcoming us "home".  The security guy at the Stamford who did the same thing as we stepped off the bus.
 It was clear some of my fellow passengers were semi-bewildered by the two- metre-high security barriers across the hotel forecourt, and the number of uniformed people including police. Most intimidating was the amount of staff in PPE. They wore a face shield, mask, blue latex gloves and plastic raincoat- style gowns. I had a flashback to the Hollywood movie Contagion.

It’s clear NBC Universal is doing this not just because comic adaptations across TV and film are pretty big, but also because it sees that rival studios have their own comics to leverage IP from instead of having to rely on outside acquisitions — just as Universal itself has been doing with things like the aforementioned _Umbrella Academy_, or with Dark Horse’s _Resident Alien_ at Syfy. But the way it’s doing it is just _bizarre_.
 UCP Graphic is launching with a single series, and the foofaraw of getting a noted comics figure like Morrison involved is blunted by the fact that he’s not actually sticking around (he’s only co-writing the first five issues of _Proctor Valley Road)_. It’s still having to work with actual outside comics publishers to release these titles, as well, unlike its rivals. It’s essentially what’s already been tried, but inversed.
 Furthermore, it raises an altogether more perplexing question: if these comics are being created for the specific purposes of finding an IP to then translate to other mediums like film and TV… why even make them comics in the first place? Does NBC Universal think people will be on board for a _Proctor Valley_ streaming series simply because it can say “based on the comic book” instead of standing as its own idea?
 In the endless race for transmedia properties, as these studios are scrambling for their own slice of the streaming service pie, the reasons why these adaptations have become so popular, and why the comics themselves even existed in the first place, seems like it’s being forgotten.

James Daniels' allegations came less than two weeks after Floyd's death while in police custody in Minneapolis, sparking civil unrest across the country.
 Colbert said he and teammates felt compelled to raise their voices.
 "It was some crazy times," he said of getting teargassed at the Iowa City protests. "It's kind of a reflection of the world today. It shows there are these issues we're fighting, and we're not fighting them for no reason. The only way to go is to make progress."
 The linebacker from Shawnee Mission, Kansas, said he's seen positive developments at Iowa. Kirk Ferentz has taken steps to make the program more inclusive, and players have discussed their concerns in team meetings.
 "That was important for guys who don't have to face the issues that Black players have to face on the team," Colbert said. "They really don't know first-hand some of the things that happened to players here."
 One of those guys is Tyler Linderbaum, who grew up nearby in Solon, population 2,600.
 "Obviously, I grew up different from a lot of my teammates," said Linderbaum, who is white. "It was really eye-opening. It was an experience you've never been through, especially me being from Solon, Iowa. It's a unique conversation and I'm glad my teammates spoke up."
