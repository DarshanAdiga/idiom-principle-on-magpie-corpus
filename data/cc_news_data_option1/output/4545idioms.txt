So, Tuesday, November 3rd, we did what we do in "Sane", vote early and vote often. Now that's a way to make it count. At the end of the day if you don't vote, you shouldn't gripe and according to the goodwife, I like to gripe. Again, some of those that know me well are quick to label me as just an "old grump" and quite cantankerous. As you are reading this, the elections are over, and it is time to start anew. Let's do the right thing and hope the process is better next time. All of that aside, the last thing I want to hear is "I approve this message."

Er zijn talloze aanvallen op de politie geweest”, twitterde de regionale staatspolitie van de deelstaat Saksen. Op Duitse media waren beelden te zien van actievoerders die agenten bekogelden met projectielen. De politie sprak over het gooien van „voorwerpen” en „vuurwerk”. Een cordon van agenten bij het station werd doorbroken. Op beelden op social media was te zien hoe demonstranten werden gearresteerd en afgevoerd.
 De autoriteiten hadden aan het einde van de middag opdracht gegeven aan de organisatoren om hun actie af te breken. Deelnemers droegen geen mondkapjes en hielden onvoldoende afstand tot elkaar, ondanks diverse oproepen van agenten om de coronamaatregelen te respecteren. Ook zouden neonazi’s zijn gespot onder de onruststokers.
 De organisatoren, een verzameling van allerlei bewegingen die zichzelf omschrijven als ‘vrijdenkers’, worden nauwlettend door de autoriteiten in de gaten gehouden sinds in augustus honderden demonstranten veiligheidsbarrières doorbraken in Berlijn en de trappen van de Reichstag, het Duitse parlementsgebouw, bestormden.

Black Friday 2020 starts on 27th November, but we all know by now that deals start long before that so much so the whole of November becomes a sale. Currys already has its sale on and we’ve previously seen deals on consoles in the Black Tag Event. We expect Currys to do the same this year. Amazon also has some early Black Friday deals with FIFA 21 appearing in cheaper bundles – though Argos currently has the best deal (console, FIFA21 and a DualShock Controller) for £309.99. We also anticipate PS4 deals continuing through to Cyber Monday, as it’s more known for its tech offers.
