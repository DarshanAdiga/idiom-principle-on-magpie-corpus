Guest columns share an author's personal perspective.
 Quite understandably, much of the current discourse surrounding the COVID-19 crisis pertains to the physical health implications of the virus. Yet amid the rise of quarantine restrictions and social distancing practices, severe gaps in mental health care and support systems also represent a substantial concern.
 Just the mere thought of coronavirus can be anxiety-provoking for a person without an existing mental health diagnosis. For people with mental illness, the stress and fear associated with a rapidly spreading pandemic is exponentially more precarious, and can exacerbate an existing mental health or substance use problem.
 Long before the coronavirus outbreak, governments and other institutions were largely failing to protect at-risk individuals from a mental health perspective. Police officers and firefighters -- whose PTSD and depression rates are as much as five times higher than the rates within the civilian population -- are more likely to die by suicide than in the line of duty.
 The medical staffs working around the clock to treat patients with COVID-19, as well as a 'regular' patient base, are also being put under greater stress and anxiety while performing their duties as they try to balance treatment and not catching the virus or passing it on.
 At the same time, mental health disabilities are increasingly pervasive on college campuses. The American College Health Association found in 2018 that 40% of undergraduates had felt so depressed within the previous 12 months that it was difficult for them to function, while more than 10% of undergraduates had seriously considered suicide during the same period.
 Additionally, four of the eight Ivy League schools prohibit students from visiting campus while they are on leave. This means that students who are taking time away from the academic demands in order to focus on their own well-being become socially isolated, as they are banned from coming to campus to share a meal with friends.
 Now, as schools shut down for the remainder of the semester and social distancing measures are implemented nationwide in order to curb the spread of coronavirus, even the imperfect safe haven of a college campus community is no longer available to students with mental health conditions. International students, many of whom cannot return home due to travel restrictions, are even more isolated at this time. With this country's health care system bracing for the strain of a novel pandemic, who will step in to care for these vulnerable individuals?
 Philanthropy must answer the call by catalyzing the discussion, increasing resources, and destigmatizing the mental health conversation. Along these lines, the Newton and Boston-based Ruderman Family Foundation has a proven infrastructure already in place.
 The foundation partnered with This Is My Brave, an organization that has speakers tell their stories of dealing with their mental health in a storytelling format, to present "This Is My Brave College Edition." The performances featured nine college students from Boston campuses who performed their stories at Lesley University, Harvard University, Northeastern University and Tufts University this past fall, and performed this spring at Boston University, Brandeis University and at the Ivy League Medical Conference at Harvard Medical School.
 We also partner with BRYT: Bridge for Resilient Youth in Transition, a program providing assistance for students to come back to school after an absence for treatment of a mental health diagnosis. Students re-entering school can feel overwhelmed, and this program helps to alleviate some of that apprehension. Each BRYT program approaches staffing, space, and services with a consistent vision, while customizing the specifics for each school population and for each student. This rapidly expanding program will undoubtedly be in greater demand when students are allowed to assimilate back on campus.
 Raising awareness and making a statement on a more national scale, we honored decorated swimmer Michael Phelps with the 2018 Morton E. Ruderman Award in Inclusion for his open discussion of his struggle with depression and anxiety.
 Currently, our organization is in the process of assessing how to specifically mobilize our resources on mental health care and support in response to COVID-19. In a world increasingly defined by isolation, we will not leave this vulnerable population behind.

Laparoscopy is a minimally invasive surgical technique performed through a keyhole incision. A small camera along with a light source attached to a tube enables surgeons to manoeuvre special disposable laparoscopic instruments to the target area and carry out the surgery. This technique is mainly preferred for carrying out surgeries related to the pancreas, liver, colon and bile duct. The use of disposable laparoscopic instruments reduce the risk of infection during surgery. Laparoscopic surgery refers to surgical procedures that are performed through one or multiple small incisions, rather than through a larger incision through the abdominal wall. Depending upon the nature of the specific surgical procedure, laparoscopic entry can be performed using a closed (Veress needle, optical access) or open technique (Hasson technique). Disposable laparoscopic instruments find applications for various other surgeries such as general surgery, bariatric surgery, colorectal surgery, urologic surgery, gynaecologic surgeries and others.

Vincenzo Montella has insisted he feels the full support of the AC Milan's hierarchy, outlining the importance of the project the Serie A giants are currently undertaking.
 Gerard Deulofeu scored late on to spare Gianluigi Donnarumma's blushes and claim a fortunate 1-1 draw at high-flying Atalanta on Saturday, as Milan bounced back from their 4-1 drubbing at the hands of Roma last time out.
 The draw has boosted Milan's chances of claiming the final Europa League qualification spot in Italy's top-flight, though extended the Rossoneri's winless streak to five matches.
 However, former Fiorentina and Sampdoria boss Montella claims to have Milan’s full backing, adding that he will still be in charge next season and is already planning his moves in the transfer market.
 "I feel the club's trust and there is a very important technical and economic project here," Montella told Premium Sport.
 "I am in agreement with the club that this team needs some improvement. It can definitely be improved with quality elements.
 "But the team must think only in the present and I will be the coach next year. I am proud and happy to coach a team of this stature.
 "For my part, there is no problem. I see a team that is following me."
 Deulofeu's goal came after a rare error from Donnarumma had allowed Andrea Conti to put Atalanta ahead, with Milan looking unlikely to craft an equaliser until the Everton loanee found space in the area with three minutes to go.
 But despite a rather lacklustre display, Montella was proud of his side's determination and resilience.
 "It was a hard-fought game. Atalanta are playing with confidence," he continued. "But Milan played with heart and soul and managed to equalise.
 "I liked the attitude. I am proud of this draw. It is a valuable point against a team that deserves to be where they are."
 Should Milan edge out Fiorentina and city rivals Inter to sixth place in Serie A, the Rossoneri would begin their Europa League qualification in late July.
 That possibility had cast doubt over a proposed pre-season tour of China, but Montella confirmed that the trip would still take place.
 "We will be going to China, where we will play two or three games," Montella affirmed.
 "Getting to Europe is important, but there is an agreement in place [to go] to China, so there are no problems."

Chelsea star Eden Hazard is unfazed by where he ranks among the world's best, but believes greater leadership can move him closer to Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.
 Hazard, 26, is widely considered one of the best players in the world, although below two clear standouts in Messi and Ronaldo.
 While the Belgium international has little interest in the discussion, he said Barcelona great Messi and Real Madrid star Ronaldo were leaders.
 "People are always talking, I don't care about that. I try to be the best I can," Hazard told UK newspapers.
 "In the world I'm not alone – they have some good, good players. I don't know if I am top five, top 10, top 20. It's not my target. I just want to enjoy my football.
 "Players like Ronaldo and Messi are leaders. They are people that want to be better every day. That's why they are at the top for the last 10 years.
 "They need to prove – we all need to prove – every day, but I don't think too much about that. I just concentrate on myself, on football, on the pitch, on the training ground. Then I will see."
 A two-time Premier League champion, Hazard can add the FA Cup to his collection when Chelsea face Arsenal in Saturday's final.
 With John Terry leaving Stamford Bridge at season's end, Hazard said the next generation of Chelsea players had a chance to step up.
 "The last 10 years in Chelsea, it was great," he said.
 "They won a lot of trophies, now it's like a new generation. Frank Lampard is finished, Didier Drogba is finished, Ashley Cole, John Terry now. So it's a new generation.
 "We have a couple of leaders – I try to be one on the pitch. All of the players, they are ready, they are 100 per cent. We will see."

Antoine Griezmann tipped Juventus to beat Real Madrid in the Champions League final, while endorsing Gianluigi Buffon for Ballon d'Or honours.
 Italian giants Juventus will meet defending European champions Madrid in the final in Cardiff on June 3.
 The Serie A titleholders have not won the Champions League since 1995-96 but Atletico Madrid star Griezmann believes Juve will reign supreme at Millennium Stadium, allowing iconic captain and goalkeeper Buffon to pip Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi to the coveted individual award.
 "Juventus will win the Champions League and therefore Gigi Buffon the Ballon d'Or," Griezmann told Cadena Ser's El Larguero.
 Runners-up last season and in 2014, Atletico almost reached back-to-back finals but the capital club were stopped in the semi-finals 4-2 on aggregate by city rivals Madrid.
 "[Finals] hurt more than semis. Because you think you're going to raise the trophy, you make moves with your people ... Then you lose and it's very hard," Griezmann said.
 Atletico also secured another season in the Champions League, having claimed third position in LaLiga.
 "We did not win titles, which is what we wanted," Griezmann added. "We fulfilled an objective, third, we did a great job. Pity about the semis."
 Atletico close out their season at home to Athletic Bilbao on Sunday.

ATLANTA— Two hundred hospital beds will be set up in a large convention center in Atlanta as an alternative treatment site for patients with mild to moderate cases of the new coronavirus, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said Sunday.
 The state has a contract with a private company, PAE, to prepare the site inside the Georgia World Congress Center, Kemp said in a news release. He said the company will work with the Georgia National Guard, the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency, the Department of Community Health, the Department of Public Health.
 The first parts of the temporary site should be available in about a week, and the site will be used for patients who do not need to be on ventilators. Kemp said projections show Georgia could hit its peak of the virus in late April.
 “We are working around the clock to prepare for future needs and ensure the health and well-being of our state,” said Kemp, a Republican.
 Georgia has more than 12,400 known cases of the virus, and the death toll is at least 433, according to figures posted Sunday by the state's health department. About 2,500 are hospitalized with the virus, according to the department.
 The number of COVID-19-related deaths in Georgia more than doubled in a week, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. On April 5, the health department reported 211 deaths.
 Health officials have conducted more than 54,400 tests in Georgia, and about 23% of those have been positive. Fulton County has the most confirmed cases with at least 1,467, and numbers have been growing at Georgia’s nursing homes and senior care facilities. The number of long-term care facilities with outbreaks was 80 as of Friday.
 For most people, the coronavirus causes mild symptoms like fever and a cough that resolve in two to three weeks. But for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, more severe symptoms can occur, including pneumonia, that can lead to death.

More than 1.2 million Pennsylvanians have filed unemployment compensation claims during the COVID-19 health emergency, and state Sen. Camera Bartolotta is reminding those hit hardest by the pandemic to take advantage of newly available resources.
   
 The Department of Labor and Industry recently created a new website to provide updates on the federal CARES Act, which extends additional benefits to claimants over a longer period of time and provides assistance to self- employed individuals, gig workers and others who do not traditionally qualify for unemployment.
   
 Expanded unemployment benefits of $600 per week went out to claimants beginning the week ending April 4. Claimants who have not yet received a payment will start receiving the extra $600 the week after receiving their first payment.
   
 The CARES Act also temporarily makes benefits available to other individuals who are not normally eligible, such as self-employed workers, independent contractors and gig workers. These individuals cannot apply through the current unemployment system; a new platform is being created to provide these benefits.
   
 "Agency staff expects to have the new system up and running within the next two weeks," said Bartolotta, R-46, Carroll Township, Washington County. "Claimants will receive backdated payments to January 27 or the first week that they were unable to work due to the coronavirus, whichever is later."
   
 A surge in the number of applicants in the system has created longer response times and a large backlog of cases in the unemployment system. Claimants can check the status of their application online, find answers to frequently asked questions and read tips on how to file an initial claim at www.uc.pa.gov.
   
 The number of claims is causing significant processing delays; what usually takes about a week to process now takes as long as three weeks, Benefits Policy and Industry director Susan Dickinson said last week. To help ease the burden, the agency has added 18 additional call centers and 100 new staff members.
   
 Dickinson urged filers to use the system's online form to file claims to cut down on call volume. Those without internet can call 1-888-313-7214, but should expect dramatic wait times.
   
 Bartolotta said claimants who filed an initial claim in mid-March who have not received a PIN should contact the Department of Labor and Industry as soon as possible. The same guidance applies to individuals who tried to reopen an existing claim in mid-March and are still listed as "inactive" when they try to file a bi-weekly claim.
   
 Individuals with question not covered on the department's website are encouraged to contact Bartolotta's office for assistance.
   
 In order to streamline the process and avoid more delays for claimants, Bartolotta supported a recently signed bill waiving the one-week waiting period for all claimants to receive benefits during the governor's disaster declaration, as well as job search and registration requirements for claimants.
   
 In addition, many Amercians experiencing financial hardship can expect to receive the federal government's $1,200 cash payment in the next month, but those who filed taxes using direct deposit will receive rebates first.
   
 Individual tax filers who make up to $75,000, or married couples who make up to $150,000, will receive full payment. For filers with incomes above those amounts, the payment is reduced and then phased out for individuals whose income exceeds $99,000, or $198,000 for joint filers without children.
   
 For those who do not have direct deposit and can't wait for a paper check, the IRS is expected to make available an online portal for qualifiers to sign up for direct deposit. The first batch of paper checks would go out in the first week of May, starting with lowest income Americans, but could take months to arrive.

 It said a fourth boat initially spotted on Friday was unaccounted for.
 "Frontex plane will fly again (Monday) morning in search of the remaining boat," a spokesman said.
 A spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said it appeared that the missing boat had capsised.
