Six touring Pakistan cricketers have tested positive for coronavirus, New Zealand Cricket announced on Thursday, alleging a breach of the bio-secure protocol by the visitors who will not be allowed to train while in quarantine for the time being.
 A jumbo Pakistan squad, led by Babar Azam, arrived in New Zealand on Tuesday and is serving a mandatory 14-day quarantine period as per coronavirus protocol.
 “Two of these six results have been deemed ‘’historical’’; four have been confirmed as new,” NZC said in a statement without revealing the names of the players who have tested positive.
 All six members of the squad will be moved to the quarantine arm of a managed isolation facility. Pakistan are here for three T20 Internationals and two Tests. The series begins December 18 in Auckland.
 “As a consequence, the Pakistan team’s exemption to train while in managed isolation has been put on hold until investigations have been completed,” the NZC stated.
 The home board also spoke of a protocol breach but did not specify the exact nature of it.
 “Separately, NZC has also been made aware that some members of the Pakistan team had contravened protocols on the first day of managed isolation. We will be having discussions with the tourists to assist them in understanding the requirements,” the NZC statement added.
 At least 10 Pakistan cricketers had tested positive for Covid-19 before the team’s England tour earlier this year.
 Prior to leaving Lahore, all members of the Pakistan squad returned negative results on the four occasions they were tested.
 In addition to the senior squad, Pakistan’s A team is also here to compete in a couple of four-day matches beginning December 10.

Given such a history, mistrust is not irrational, and the only way to overcome it will be to treat it with respect. Ultimately, the answer is to end the medical racism that affects so many Black people around the world — the belief that Black bodies don’t feel pain, the inability of doctors to recognize life- threatening symptoms on darker skin and the inequitable care given to Black patients across the board.

A picture of 1985 says it all. It shows Ahmed Patel with Arun Singh and Oscar Fernandes in a single frame along with former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi while taking oath as the parliamentary secretary. It was this stint which drew Patel close to the Gandhi family, as he rose up the ranks to become a silent operator from behind the scenes, yet one of the most powerful voices in the party after the Gandhis. Congress leader Patel passed away on Wednesday morning at 3.30 a.m. at the age of 71 after Covid 19 related complications at a Gurugram Hospital. Patel, Singh and Fernandes were referred to as Amar, Akbar and Anthony following the famous Bollywood flick starring Amitabh Bachchan, Vinod Khanna and Rishi Kapoor, which was released in 1977, the year Patel was elected to the Lok Sabha. Incidentally, both the Akbar of that film, Rishi Kapoor, and Patel left for heavenly abode in 2020. While both Singh and Fernandes held ministrial berths, no position could lure Patel, who was known as the chief strategist weilding more power than many in the party. While Singh fell out of favor in 1988 despite coming from a royal background and being Rajiv Gandhi s classmate in England, Fernandes is still active in politics. But none gained the confidence of the Gandhis like Patel did. He was a master strategist who avoided media glare and did not take any post despite having worked closely with three Prime Ministers Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and Manmohan Singh. There were three ocassions which shaped Patel. He was fondly remembered in 1977 when ne won the lok Sabha polls despite the Janta Party wave. Then he was apppointed the parliamentary secretary to Rajiv Gandhi, while Sonia Gandhi appointed him as her political secretary. He worked closely with Rajiv Gandhi who appointed him as the president of Gujarat Congress and also gave him responsibility of completing the Jawahar Bhawan, which he did before time. Patel was the treasurer when the coup against then President Sitaram Kesri was engineered, and he had walked out to support Sonia Gandhi. After the demise of Rajiv Gandhi, during Narsimha Rao s time, it was Patel who had garnered the highest number of votes and got elected to the CWC in the Tirupati session of the party. Many leaders who are in the party are mourning his death and recalling their association with him.
