Our nation, since its birth, has been multicultural, multi-ethnic, multi- religious. The foundations on which it was built were the equality of all people, the inalienable rights to life and freedom granted by the Creator himself to all people, tolerance, peaceful coexistence, equal opportunities for prosperity and well-being for all. These ideals are inscribed in the DNA of the United States of America and are part of its founding documents. But these principles, in the final analysis, are nothing more than the translation of Christianity into the language of civil law. That is why we Christians, every time we make Jesus' teaching known, are helping all our fellow citizens to return to the authentic ideals of our nation, its constitution and its laws.

 Ellerton also recommended only using local contractors whenever possible.
 “There are revenue build companies that come in from Colorado and what not, but it’s hard to get them to come back and repair something if something went wrong,” he said.
 Even using local workers requires some vetting, Ellerton said. In these types of situations it’s easy for people to be in a hurry to get work done and forget to ask questions.
 “I would be cautious of the people that want to do it right away; that want to take over and say ‘oh they’ll take care of it for you’ and, ‘we’ll work with your insurance company,’” Ellerton cautioned. “Don’t sign anything until you’ve worked it out with your adjustor and your contractor.”
 Ellerton also said to be weary of contractors who want to do all the legwork.

Doppio omicidio questa mattina oltre confine, nella zona di Villach, vicino al Faaker See, in Austria. Due donne sono state uccise da un uomo che poi si e dato alla fuga e ha varcato il confine italiano. Ne hanno dato notizia questa mattina gli organi di stampa della Carinzia. Giunto a Tarvisio, si e tolto la vita nel posteggio di una pizzeria del centro. In questo momento, alle 13, la Polizia di Stato di Frontiera sta eseguendo i rilievi. Informato il magistrato.
 L'uomo, 64 anni, si e tolto la vita con un colpo di arma da fuoco all'interno della sua vettura. Prima, intorno alle 9 di questa mattina, avrebbe sparato all'ex moglie di 62 anni e a un'amica di lei di 56 anni.
 Gli agenti della Polizia di Frontiera non hanno fatto in tempo ad avvicinarsi alla sua auto, la cui targa era stata segnalata dai colleghi della polizia carinziana, che hanno sentito il colpo di arma da fuoco. Inutili i soccorsi.

On Sunday night, Rabbi Richard Altabe marched arm in arm with two black politicians protesting police brutality at a demonstration in Far Rockaway.
 The next morning, Orthodox Jews in the same New York neighborhood showed up at the local police precinct to drop off pastries for the officers - 101 danishes for the 101st Precinct.
 The principal of the Hebrew Academy of Long Beach's lower school, Altabe sees no contradiction between Orthodox Jews participating in a march against police misconduct and their sugary goodwill gesture the next morning.
 "We wanted them to know that even though we support the protests, we also supported the police and we're grateful to the police and the work they do," Altabe said.
 The two gestures - opposing police misconduct while supporting the police more generally - are emblematic of the fine line Orthodox Jews have navigated in responding to sweeping protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd at the hands of white Minneapolis police officers.
 "Many Orthodox Jews have had negative interactions personally with the police and have seen others who have and certainly understand and are sympathetic to the idea around police accountability and reform," said David Greenfield, a former New York city councilman who now leads the Met Council, a Jewish nonprofit serving needy New Yorkers. "At the same time, however, they are generally supportive of the NYPD because they're generally concerned about public safety and the looting."
 Orthodox Jewish communities are both more politically conservative and more inward-focused than non-Orthodox Jewish communities in America. That dynamic was on display this week in the flood of statements from Jewish organizations weighing in on the protests and the societal conditions they aim to upset. While some organizations were quick to respond with detailed descriptions of proposed policy changes and pledges to work toward them, Orthodox organizations were slower to weigh in, vaguer in their visions and made a point of condemning the violence that unfolded at some of the protests.
 In a statement yesterday, the National Council of Young Israel, an umbrella group of Orthodox synagogues, said Floyd's killing showed that "racism is regrettably still alive and well in our country" and that it is critical that "the grave danger posed by systemic racism is duly addressed once and for all." But the statement also noted that most law enforcement officers are "heroes" who risk their lives to protect ordinary citizens, regardless of skin color.
 "These honorable officers should not be attacked or tarnished by the misconduct of others; however, it is essential that an effort be undertaken to remove any police officer that does in fact exhibit a degree of racial and ethnic bigotry," the group said.
 The Orthodox Union and the Rabbinical Council of America, the two principal national organizations representing Modern Orthodoxy, both condemned Floyd's killing and expressed support for peaceful protests against racism while condemning the violence and looting. Agudath Israel, which represents haredi Orthodox communities, did much the same, though the Agudath statement did not use the word "racism."
 "Like all decent Americans, we are horrified by the senseless and ruthless killing of George Floyd, and we join in solidarity with the outpouring of hurt, anger and frustration expressed by responsible citizens protesting peacefully," the group said. "We are also greatly saddened by the frightening scenes of innocent bystanders and store owners under siege, threatened by violence and mayhem, and facing the prospect of lost livelihoods and uncertain futures."
 The differing responses of Orthodox groups from their Reform and Conservative counterparts may be explained at least in part by politics. Unlike most American Jews, who tend to vote for Democrats, Orthodox Jews have leaned increasingly Republican in recent years. According to the most recent Pew Center study of American Jews, 57% of Orthodox Jews are Republican or lean Republican compared to just 22% of American Jews as a whole.
 Several Orthodox politicians in New York put out statements to similar effect, supporting peaceful protests and condemning the death of George Floyd without directly criticizing the police. But some also spent several days questioning why protesters were allowed to gather en masse while religious gatherings are still restricted because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 On Tuesday, Simcha Eichenstein, a state assemblyman representing two heavily Orthodox neighborhoods in Brooklyn, and Kalman Yeger, a New York City councilman, sent a letter to Governor Andrew Cuomo saying that the protests are evidence that the time for lockdown had passed.
 "Protesters are gathering, perhaps well-meaning, but surely with little regard for social-distancing standards. It has also unfortunately brought out rioters who are destroying what is left of our economy, eviscerating the life's work of our fellow New Yorkers," they wrote. "The lockdown may not have formally ended, but the calls for mass peaceful marching without any regard for social- distancing have rendered a continual lockdown at this point ludicrous."
 Eichenstein also tweeted in frustration over the different rules regarding protests and religious gatherings.
 "Sure, protesters have the right under the first amendment to march against racism, which needs to be confronted head on in this country, but the same first amendment guarantees religious people the right to practice their faith," he wrote in response to a statement by the mayor at a press conference.
 By Thursday, Eichenstein's focus had shifted. He placed a sign in the window of his Borough Park office with the words George Floyd repeated before his death, "I can't breathe," in large print. He also expressed mourning and solidarity with the black community in a video Thursday. "As a Hasidic Orthodox Jew, my message is we, the Orthodox Jewish people, stand with you in solidarity, we must eliminate hate wherever it exists," Eichenstein said.
 The city council's Jewish caucus, chaired by Orthodox city councilman Chaim Deutsch, put out a statement Monday expressing solidarity with the black community but without mentioning the police. And in a letter to constituents Thursday, State Senator Simcha Felder called George Floyd's death an "act of pure evil," saying that to ignore the message being sent by the black community about continued discrimination would be "unconscionable."
 But Felder also condemned the looting and violence against police officers.
 "So let's protest what we see is wrong and let's inspire change without vilifying every member of the NYPD- they are people, too. Let's not trade one evil for another," he wrote.
 Devorah Halberstam, an activist on anti-Semitism in Crown Heights who frequently speaks to new police recruits as part of their training, said the statements this week reflect the Orthodox community's priorities.
 "I think most people feel that people have a right to protest," Halberstam said. "However, people are just concerned about safety and everyone wants to feel that they're safe and that their stores are safe, their communities are safe."

The Good Samaritan Society in Hays confirmed Friday that one of its residents has tested positive for COVID-19.
   
 Shortly after Ellis County Health Services Director Jason Kennedy announced a new active case in the county Friday morning, Good Samaritan Society administrator Noe Gillespie issued a statement confirming a positive case at the long-term care facility located at 2700 Canal Blvd.
   
 "All residents, families and staff have been notified," Gillespie said. "Our facility is continuing to follow local, state and federal guidance in our response to the situation, which includes working closely with Ellis County Health Department and following KDHE guidelines to offer COVID-19 tests to all residents and staff in the coming days.
   
 "We are grateful to the community for the support and resources that have been graciously extended. The health and safety of those we serve remains our highest priority during this unprecedented time."
   
 Kennedy said in Friday's news release that the case was identified through contact tracing with testing sent to a private lab, and contacts have been notified. The person who tested positive has no symptoms and is in isolation.
   
 "The case is a contact of a known positive from out of state. This individual is a resident of a local long-term care facility," Kennedy said in the release. "ECHD is working closely with the facility and KDHE to ensure that this case remains isolated. ECHD remains committed to ensuring the health and well being of all residents and visitors of Ellis County."

The National Audubon Society reports that although populations of cliff swallows continue to spread in the eastern half of the country, they are still more common in the west, “where practically every culvert and highway bridge seems to have its own cliff swallow colony.”
 Wow, more common in the west. As common as they are here, it’s hard to imagine.
 The birds’ return to Mission San Juan Capistrano -- a former Spanish mission founded in 1776 — each year is traditionally celebrated there every March 19, although the birds actually return to that area in late February.
 But more on the famous birds in odds and ends.
 Appearance
 Cliff swallows are small, multi-colored birds with pointed wings. They measure about five inches in length. Males and females are similar in appearance, and usually have dark blue brood patches at the base of the throat (see photos). However, males typically have larger blue patches than females, who sometimes lack the blue coloring all together.
 They have cobalt blue on their backs and crowns, cinnamon faces and throats, and are buffy on the underparts and rumps, although the rumps can have some rufous mixed in. They also have buffy foreheads and collars.
 To spot the difference between a cliff swallow and the similar-looking barn swallow, look for the coloration, and, maybe more importantly, the tails.
 Cliff swallows have squared tails — sometimes notched — while barn swallows have forked tails.
 Range
 Cliff swallows are summer residents to North America, and their range covers much of the continent, including all of Oklahoma. Their range extends from Texas to Maine, to Alaska and down into Mexico.
 Cliff swallows spend winters in South America.
 Habitat
 Cliff swallows can be found in a variety of habitats including grasslands, open and semi-open land, river edges, lakes, and even parks and towns.

Thomas John asked if my grandma liked children, if she was warm. I waffled on that answer. She had eight kids, but according to my mom she wasn't the warmest parent. Her relationship with her grandchildren was much different. Thomas John knew she didn't have a formal education and said she was thought of as wise by us. Wise is one way to describe it--she was cranky. We used to call her Crabby Road, like the comic strip, an association she welcomed. But she had her warm moments, with me specifically.
 When Thomas John asked if we talked on the phone a lot, I immediately said no. She wasn't much a phone talker, but after our reading I remembered a very specific conversation. Once, while I was away at college, she called me out of the blue. I assumed something was wrong, but it was just a brief checking in conversation. She ended the call and asked if I was dating anybody. She said it didn't matter if it was a woman or man, if they were black, white, yellow, purple or green, all that matters is my happiness. Hearing this from a woman I revered, two years before I came out to her, was important. When I did eventually come out to her, she again asked if I was happy and if so, that's all that matters.

Is requiring customers to wear a mask, at least in the short term as we continue to collect data on how the virus reacts to the re-opening of society, not a reasonable request?
 Casinos control so much when you are in their little world. From the air to the smell to the lighting to well, whatever rules they want. Cell phones away. No pictures of the odds boards. It wouldn’t be out of the norm for the house to throw another rule, albeit a temporary one, onto the list. Especially one that has very little downside.
 But they have stopped short here for some reason. While every casino is requiring employees to wear a mask, only the Wynn, MGM and Caesars are encouraging guests to wear a covering over their face but weren’t pressured by the Nevada Gaming Control Board to make it anything more than an “encouragement.”
 As someone in the New York City area, my learning curve went at warp speed. One week, I was embarrassed to wear a mask at a supermarket. A week later, it was expected. Now, it’s the people who aren’t wearing masks that are the outliers.
 Of course this isn’t apples to apples. The virus’ impact wildly varies from region to region. My county of 800,000 people had 1,700 deaths. The entire state of Nevada has lost a little more than 400 people in a state that has four times the population.
 It just says a lot to me that all of these businesses are willing to risk opening up without the requirement of masks. Given that there are thousands of lawsuits a year around the world over bedbugs in hotels, you gotta think these casinos are taking an unnecessary risk.
 Casinos stay in business because they know the odds. But what happens when that isn’t the case?

A pulse ox is a little device that clamps onto your finger to detect your heart rate and how much oxygen is in your blood.
 Lapidus said that if a person is conscious and has low oxygen, it's likely a sign of the coronavirus because otherwise, people with low oxygen are normally unconscious or not able to speak or breathe.
 "You're listening to the symptoms and you're basically coming to the conclusion on your own," Lapidus told Business Insider of potential coronavirus patients. "Whether or not it's confirmed, when somebody says they've been coughing for a week with a high-grade fever and their saturation is low, we more or less think in our heads, it's another positive case."

The graph above shows how hard it has been for an investor to deal with GME in the past year. Shares have consistently failed to reclaim 12-month highs, while bouncing all over the place. More important than the business prospects, the stock has been influenced by speculations on the gaming console cycle, drama at the Board of Directors, sky-high short interest, and the buying and selling of shares by a celebrity investor.
 There are currently 2,800 names trading at the New York Stock Exchange. Why would I ever consider buying GME, other than for the pure joy of gambling, with so many more compelling alternatives to it in the market?

The shocking footage of Thursday night's incident sparked outrage as protesters continue to gather across the US demanding an end to police brutality following the death of George Floyd in police custody last week.
 The video, which was taken by a reporter from local radio station WBFO, shows Gugino approaching a line of officers in riot gear outside Buffalo City Hall after the city's 8pm curfew on Thursday.
 As he tries to speak to the officers, they immediately begin shouting at him to move along, before one of them pushes him with a baton and a second cop shoves him with his hand.
 The elderly man is then seen staggering before falling back and hitting his head on the sidewalk.
 The sound of a crack is heard and then blood is seen pouring from his head.
 In the horrifying scenes, most cops ignore Gugino who lies unresponsive and bleeding on the ground and keep marching past.
 The cop who pushed him with a baton is seen pausing to lean over him, before he is motioned away by another officer.
 Someone is then heard calling for a medic for the man.
 Gugino was taken to the hospital where he was being kept in a serious but stable condition.
 Mayor Brown initially slammed the incident saying he was 'deeply disturbed by the video.'
 'Tonight, after a physical altercation between two separate groups of protesters participating in an illegal demonstration beyond the curfew, two Buffalo Police officers knocked down a 75-year-old man. The victim is in stable but serious condition at ECMC,' he said in a statement late Thursday.
 'After days of peaceful protests and several meetings between myself, police leadership and members of the community, tonight's event is disheartening.'
 The video has been widely shared on social media, with many calling for the police officers to be fired.
 MSNBC correspondent Joy Reid was among those who expressed outrage over the police officers failing to help the man as he lay on the ground.
 'The rest just step over him while one calls it in. And then they grab another protester. What country is this and what century?' she tweeted.
 Actor Kumail Nanjiani also criticized the Buffalo Police Department's initial claim that the man tripped and fell, suggesting the cops would have likely gotten away with their actions if video hadn't emerged.
 It comes as the NYPD, as well as police officers across the country, have come under fire for using excessive force on people protesting peacefully.

Like many other parts of life, visits to doctors, dentists, ophthalmologists, physical therapists, and other healthcare providers have had to be put on hold since the pandemic started. Now quarantine restrictions are starting to ease in some states and doctors have begun to see patients again. But is it safe to go to the doctor during the COVID-19 pandemic?
 The rules depend on where you live. For example, just recently the pause in elective surgeries was lifted in some parts of New York state. And on the other side of the country, the California Department of Public Health gave the state's dentists the green light after restricting non-emergency appointments mid-March.
 Even if you live in an area that's been given the all-clear for non-urgent treatment, there are still risks of being exposed to the coronavirus during a doctor's visit. A check-up is a very hands-on experience, and going into a doctor's office might feel scary because, well, that's where sick people are.
 We talked to medical professionals about what to consider before you decide whether to make the trip to the doctor's office.

A fine spring afternoon, warm and sunny, blue sky filled with birdsong, found us dropping off bicycles and dry clothes for a shuttle at Society Turn, in anticipation of floating the valley floor. Continuing into town, we inflated Muffy the Ducky, rigged, and embarked in high spirits.
 It was a float from spring into summer, the flanks of surrounding peaks still white with snow. The feeling was very alpine, very Colorado. As we headed west, the closed-in box canyon eased its embrace and broadened, willow thickets giving way to sweeping fields open to the breeze, the wide-open feeling more like Wyoming. By the time we floated through a corridor of ponderosas, water crystal clear — peak runoff and its muddy waters yet to come — cobbles below in sharp focus on the riverbed, we were in our own private Idaho. Ahead, beyond the ranching mesas, blue above fading to pale green on the horizon, beckoned Montana. Big Sky Country.
 The many twists and turns of the river had been more easily negotiated last year, the region’s waterways swollen with melt-off from the winter’s bumper crop of snow. This time around, the river a little bony, there were a few more snags to avoid, a few more protruding rocks with whom we did not wish to make acquaintance. Still, unexpected encounters will occur in life, but nothing this day was so calamitous that we couldn’t keep bumbling along.

Even toast posed a challenge. His toaster broke, so he turned to the stove. But because his stove top is pitched at an angle, the bread cooked on only one side, which burned. The center was cold. The butter didn’t melt evenly.
 One appliance that hasn’t failed him is the rice cooker he bought a few years ago and has started using regularly over the past two months. “It has been a huge savior for me,” he said.
 Lauren O’Connor’s strategy is to “get a bit drunk, cook as much food as I possibly can and chuck it in the freezer,” she said. “Most stuff can be salvaged with a can of tomatoes, some garlic and chili powder. If it doesn’t taste like something I dug out of the garden, I am fine.”
 O’Connor, 32, a paleoclimatologist in Tucson, Arizona, is subsisting on defrosted batches of beans and rice, paired with toast topped with Vegemite, a food spread she grew up on in Australia.
 She’s not the only one using the time at home to connect with her culinary roots. Richard David recently attempted to recreate his family’s Guyanese chicken curry in his apartment in Queens, New York.
 The dish was taking a while, so he drank a little wine and fell asleep on the couch with the pot still on the stove. He woke to a smoky apartment and a pitch-black curry.
 There was a silver lining: “I also realized my smoke detectors don’t work,” David, 34, said.
 Certain dishes have emerged as especially popular during quarantine — like the whipped dalgona coffee that has taken social media by storm.
 Jennifer Tallman thought the drink might be a way to dip a toe into cooking. She tried making it with an immersion blender at home in Manhattan. “The mixture went everywhere,” she said. “My kitchen ceiling, floor and my shirt.”
 She also tried to stage a romantic date night, cooking garlic shrimp pasta for her husband, John. “We had some wine, we were listening to Frank Sinatra,” she said. “I was trying to do it like we see in the movies.”
 The pasta came out chewy and not garlicky enough. “There wasn’t an ounce of joy that came from it,” she concluded.
 Now, every night, she roasts vegetables and fries some eggs, and for the rest of the evening, her husband snacks on Little Debbie Nutty Buddy bars and Turtle Brownies to fill up. Sometimes the vegetables are raw or burned when they emerge from the oven. She eats them anyway; as an executive assistant and fitness instructor, she has little time to spend in the kitchen.
 A lack of enthusiasm for cooking can become even harder to bear when there are children involved.
 “I don’t want to feed my son chicken tenders and frozen pizzas,” said Miranda Richardson, an administrator for the police department in Laurel, Maryland. But what she makes may not pass muster with him. “Kids tell the truth when they don’t like food.”
 She pointed out that she is actually a good cook — she recently made a vanilla cake, since so many others are baking — but still dislikes it. “Being in that kitchen just does not make me happy,” she said.
 In Bethesda, Maryland, Kathryn Spindel is living with her adult daughter, Pippa, 22, who moved back home in March. If it weren’t for her husband’s cooking, Spindel, 54, said there might be a repeat of the dinner of cut apples and cheese she once served her daughter when he was out of town.

“We shot all live in New York, all in live locations, and the club there was a real club, which presents its own problems,” Morgan recently told _Closer Weekly_ in an exclusive interview. “There was also a heatwave in New York when we were shooting it and I had to wear this huge coat during part of it, so it’s like 100 degrees and you’re in this huge coat, trying to get through this big monologue. But everybody was _so_ into it. I mean everybody was so excited about the concept, about the gay club, about just bringing people in. I think the gay community felt like they didn’t get a shot for a long time. I started in theatre when I was 10 and I had a lot of gay actor friends who had to hide who they were to get cast, and this ensemble gets to work in a show about a club where everybody can just be themselves and have their friends and nobody’s judgment. I think with the gay community, it’s great, but a lot of straight people are going to see themselves in it, too. I hope people check it out, because I think they will really like it. It’s a fun show and very over the top.”

The market is not easy to navigate in the best of times; however, it remains extremely uncertain right now in these difficult times. Nonetheless, we remain on the lookout for companies that offer sustainable and growing dividends and are trading cheap on a relative basis to the broader market as well as to their respective 52-week highs. We believe in keeping a buy list handy and dry powder ready so that we can use the opportunity when the time is right. Besides, we think, every month, this analysis is able to highlight some companies that otherwise would not be on our radar.
 This article is part of our monthly series, where we scan the entire universe of roughly 7,500 stocks that are listed and traded on US exchanges, including over-the-counter (OTC) networks. We usually highlight five stocks that may have temporary difficulties and/or lost favor with the market and offering deep discounts on a relative basis. However, that's not the only criteria that we apply. While seeking cheaper valuations, we also demand that the companies have an established business model, solid dividend history, manageable debt, and investment-grade credit rating. Please note that these are not recommendations to buy, but should be considered as a starting point for further research.
 This month, we highlight two groups of five stocks each that have an average dividend yield (as a group) of 2.70% and 6.39%, respectively. The first list is for conservative investors, while the second one is for investors who seek higher yield but are still reasonably safe.
 We start with a fairly simple goal. We want to shortlist five companies that are large-cap, relatively safe, dividend-paying, and trading at relatively cheaper valuations in comparison to the broader market. The objective here is to highlight and bring to the notice of value-oriented readers some of the dividend-paying and dividend-growing companies that may be offering juicy dividends due to a temporary decline in their share prices. The excess decline may be due to an industry-wide decline or some kind of one-time setbacks like some negative news coverage or missing quarterly earnings expectations. We adopt a methodical approach to filter down the 7,500-plus companies into a small subset.

With the COVID-19 pandemic closing down festivals around the world, the event set for Aug. 28-29 is still set to happen for the time being, but that could change. For a charitable organization like the Lions Club, cancellations can make a huge dent in the ability to give.
 “We’d definitely explore other fundraisers throughout the year,” Mitchell said. “The music festival, the money that we make goes right back into the community. We’ll try to figure out, is it a steak fry, or is it any other type of fundraiser to compensate for that … We’re trying to be proactive with the Lions Club, because the average age of Lions Club, I would say, is over 55. Some of our members are at higher risk of COVID, so we’re very aware of that and wanting to be responsible for that and not put our members in danger, either. But there are other opportunities.”
 Of course, the meals and socialization that come at monthly meetings are a part of the appeal of the club. With phases of reopening moving along, Mitchell and the club hope to start meeting again soon.
 “We’re trying to get more clarity from the governor and the phases as to if we can meet,” he said. “Hopefully here in the very near future, we can try to start taking on some old business and some new business and maintain our function to make sure that we have the resources for the needs we have to fill.”

Before coronavirus struck the nation's capitol, D.C. allowed all registered voters to vote by mail without an excuse and elect to do so permanently.
 In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the District strongly encouraged voters to request mail-in ballots for the June 2 presidential and city council primary elections while drastically reducing the number of open polling places from the usual 144 vote centers that would ordinarily be open to just 20.
 But D.C. had significant problems with scaling up their mail-in voting as 92,000 voters requested ballots, a massive increase from the 7,321 D.C. residents who voted by mail in the 2016 presidential primary.
 Both media outlets like the Washington Post, and several city councilmembers reported hearing from thousands of D.C. voters -- including many who requested ballots far in advance -- that they did not receive their ballots at all or until the day of the election.

At 21, she began pursuing another interest: veganism, which she had tried off and on since she was 8 years old. She has written a best-selling cookbook, “The Kind Diet,” and been frequently interviewed, including by The New York Times, about her “green” beauty routine.
 The sideline, though, came with some side eye. She faced criticism for putting her son, Bear Blu, on a vegan diet and “bird-feeding” him. (Although vegan diets are controversial for children, this is not settled in the medical community. A spokesperson for Silverstone wrote in an email that he “chooses to eat vegan.”) And again when she wrote in her second book, “The Kind Mama,” a diet- and lifestyle-based parenting guide, that her son, who was a baby at the time, had “never had a drop of medicine.” Silverstone — like other celebrities, including Jessica Biel and Jenny McCarthy — has made anti- immunization statements.

Hikers visiting the Lifta natural reserve, on the outskirts of Jerusalem, attempted to turn the popular spring into a giant bubble bath over the weekend, according to the Hebrew website N12.
 The bathers poured what appeared to be bubble bath soap into the springs causing it to foam up. While seemingly lighthearted - considering the spring doesn't have a proper filtration system as it runs on natural flowing water, the soap and bubbles settled on the water which has the ability damage the spring and the surrounding environment.
 "I arrived at the spring and saw some hikers there, and the water was normal then. When we returned an hour and a half later everything was completely white and foamy. At first we didn't understand what it was, but as we got closer we smelled soap," Ella Moore, a patron of the spring, told N12. "We've seen trash and litter all along the route, it's a shame that travelers leave garbage and don't keep the nature sites clean. It's important to have fun but also to take care of the environment."
 Inspectors from Israel's Nature and Parks Authority are currently investigating the incident.
 The scenic area is famous for the old stone buildings that are visible from the entrance to Jerusalem, which were built into the steep hillside by Arab residents in the 19th century.
 Lifta has been inhabited since the First Temple Period, and was first mentioned in the Mishna. Within the village still stand some of the buildings buildings from the First Temple period and the Crusader period. Known as one of the original suburbs of Jerusalem's Old City, along with Malha and Ein Karem.
 Historical Lifta reached from Mevaseret Zion to the walls of the Old City, an expansive 100,000 dunams (10,000 hectares) that was home to 3,000 people and had 600 houses. "Old Lifta" is the part that travelers on Highway 1 see upon entering the capital, though there are still a few original Lifta houses near Sheikh Jarrah.
 Over the centuries, it went through all the historical developments of the region under various and successive denominations. Until 1948 it was an Arab village, whose residents left after the War of Independence.
 The strategic location of the village, climbing up a steep wadi and stretching towards the Old City, looking down on most of modern-day Jerusalem, meant it was one of the first villages to experience violence leading up to the siege of the city.
 After the Arab families left due to the heavy fighting in early 1948, the state moved Yemenite and Kurdish Jewish refugees into the homes in the 1950s. The Jewish families were evicted in the late 1960s.
 Today the houses and the village is abandoned, and the area is considered a national reserve by the State of Israel.

 Since espalier fruit trees grow in a smaller space, it allows the gardener to experiment with more cultivars and improve flower pollination. Fruit trees trained as espalier make disease and insect control easier. Pruning improves air circulation around the foliage reducing disease problems. And since trees are pruned to a manageable size, pesticide applications and harvesting are easier too.

The appointment of Lateef Gray and the District Attorney’s policy change in charging cases involving police resistance or assault was also praised by community leaders. “It is important for IIB to have a leader who will fight to address and charge rogue police officers within SFPD, as the Black community has been waiting for justice for a long time,” said Phelicia Jones, Founder of Wealth and Disparities in the Black Community, and community advocate and activist for Justice 4 Mario Woods and Union Steward SEIU 1021. “Black Lives Matter includes the Black community being included in some decision making when it comes to our community’s welfare, and I am looking forward to working with Attorney Lateef Gray to ensure the Black community is protected.”

But it’s important to remember context. Before the coronavirus appeared, federal finances were in bad shape. That was during a time when unemployment was at a 50-year low. Now, the Congressional Budget Office says that the debt is going to surpass the record set during World War II by next year. And even that doesn’t anticipate the inevitable additional rounds of coronavirus spending.
 Unlike World War II, however, debt will not simply go away once the crisis is over. The retirement of baby boomers, coupled with rising health care costs, is going to keep adding to the debt in coming decades. The coronavirus simply accelerated America’s grim fiscal reckoning, bringing it a decade earlier than it otherwise would have been.
 While there isn’t a magic amount of debt that triggers a crisis, there is agreement among economists that such large and growing debt makes a fiscal crisis more likely. When it arrives, investors will become alarmed about the federal government’s ability to service the debt and consequently reluctant to buy more without earning high interest rates. And those push the debt higher faster. Lawmakers will be trapped in a vicious cycle, having to choose among undesirable options such as crushing tax increases and sudden and severe cuts to spending. Either of these could cripple the economy.
 In other words, if lawmakers throw caution to the winds in responding to our crisis, they could set the country up for an even longer period of economic stagnation.
 After decades of ignoring rising debt, it would be imprudent to tighten the purse strings in a time of crisis, when spending is desperately needed. But the danger of reckless spending is that it will lead to a misallocation of resources, and dig a deeper hole for future congresses to deal with.

Sioux Falls hosted that 2011 state meet. Blain said she and teammate Savannah Childers were really quiet and nervous before the race.
 Spearfish collected 41 points and secured its first state title in 20 years. Childers placed second, with Caitlin Gehner fifth and Blain 13th. Elise Reid (33rd place), Kaycee Jo Johnson (87th), and Suzi Meyerink (97th) also represented the Spartans.
 Blain talked about the team’s mood immediately after the race that day.
 “We were trying to do the math, but at that point, we still didn’t really know on our own,” Blain said. “I don’t remember it really feeling true until they announced it at the awards ceremony.”
 Blain recalled feeling shock when those results were announced, because the team outperformed others that were regarded as favorites.
 The Spartans’ roster boasted quite a few seniors. “To have that be their final experience was really exciting,” Blain said.
 Other highlights of that season for Blain included the relationships created with her

 Hence, officials should take up the issue with the higher authorities in Bengaluru, he added.
 “Raichur needs industries so that the district can be developed and local youths can get jobs,” he said.
 The district administration has already written to the authorities but there has been no reply. Thus, district officers should meet the authorities personally to get the necessary approvals, the Deputy Commissioner stressed.
 He further directed the officer to send a proposal to develop the industrial area in Deodurg and also acquire the land next to the industrial area in Manvi to extend the area.
 He also asked officials to take action to allot over five acres of land from the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board to the Raichur Chemical Manufacturers’ Association.
 Pointing out the lack of facilities for the existing industrial areas at Gadwal Road and Manchalapur village, Mr. Venkatesh Kumar directed officials of the Karnataka Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Board ( KUWSSB) to supply water to the industries.
 The Deputy Commissioner also advised the lead bank manager to sanction loans as per guidelines issued by the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) and Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

Some athletes play multiple sports growing up, while others decide to focus on just one.
 DuBois’ Nick DiLullo, who recently graduated as part of the Class of 2020, could technically fall into both categories.
 The Beaver grew up playing three sports — football, basketball and baseball. He began playing baseball and football at the age of 5 and 6, respectively, and later picked up basketball. He made Little League All-Stars three years in a row as a youth on the diamond.
 DiLullo continued to play all three until his sophomore year when he made the decision to focus on football.
 “My favorite sport is football because I enjoy the competitiveness,” DiLullo said. “I enjoy spending time with my friends, and I enjoy all the memories I made while playing and traveling to away games with the fun bus rides. And, I enjoy just playing a game while having fun.”
 The choice proved to be the right one for the Beaver, as he earned two varsity letters, led DuBois in receiving his senior season and is set to continue playing the sport at the collegiate level.
 He first stepped on a football field as a youth in flag football before playing a year of midgets. He started playing junior high football in eighth grade and eventually reached the varsity level in football as a junior.
 He hauled in 11 catches for 175 yards with touchdown that season on a Beavers’ squad that went 4-7 and lost to rival Clearfield, 45-14, in a District 6-9 Class 4A semifinal game.
 DiLullo stepped up as a senior and became the team’s deep threat in the passing game for a team that experienced its share of struggles and lost its starting quarterback (Alex Kovalyak) during Week 7.
 He led the Beavers in receiving yards (577), touchdown catches (6) and yards per catch (17.5) for players with more than five grabs. He was actually third on the team in receptions with 33. He also played defense, recording 13 tackles and had a team-high five passes defensed.
 One game in particular stood out to the Beaver during his career in a DuBois uniform.
 “The first game of my senior year against Clearfield, when I had the most receiving yards and touchdowns in one game in my high school career,” he said.
 DiLullo hauled in 11 catches for 175 yards with two touchdowns in that 2019 season opener, a game the Beavers lost 31-20 to the Bison in Clearfield.
 With high school freshly in his rear view mirror, DiLullo is preparing to move on to Thiel College, where he will continue his football career alongside three of his fellow Beavers seniors — Kovalyak, Lucas Buchanan and Jackson Pletcher.
 “I am excited to be able to play with Alex, my quarterback throughout high school (at Thiel), said DiLullo. “And, Jackson and Lucas being there as well will also be a good time.”
 DiLullo plans to major in business management at Thiel.
 Outside of sports, DiLullo was a member of the National Honor Society. He also enjoys hunting, fishing and hanging out with his friends and girlfriend.
 Playing football, DiLullo didn’t have his final year of sports directly affected by COVID-19 like a lot of athletes, but like all students, he felt its impact in that regard.
 “I am upset I didn’t get to finish out my senior year with all of the fun activities the school had planned for us like prom and our senior activities,” he said.
 DiLullo, who is the son of Mike and Lori DiLullo, has an older brother Domenic who competed in wrestling and track and field at DAHS.

Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS organizations including hospitals, said the British government appeared to be making last-minute decisions “on the hoof" that seem “overly influenced” by political considerations.
 “I think it’s the latest in a long line of announcements that have had a major impact on the way the NHS operates, in which those frontline organisations feel they have been left completely in the dark and they are then expected to make significant and complex operational changes either immediately or with very little notice," he told the BBC.
 His criticism was echoed by the British Medical Association, which warned there was “little detail” on how the policy would be implemented, where the masks would come from or how outpatients and visitors would be given them.
 While acknowledging that face coverings will play an important role in the next stage of the pandemic, the BMA's consultants committee chair Dr. Rob Harwood pointed to the consistent lack of personal protective equipment through the pandemic, which has seen more than 40,000 people die in the U.K. across all settings, including hospitals and care homes — the second-highest figure in the world.
 “It is absolutely crucial that the government ensures there are enough supplies of face masks for staff, and adequate provision of face coverings for outpatients and the public by June 15,” he said.
 The Department of Health and Social Care said NHS England, which oversees budget and planning issues, had been informed and that hospitals have all of next week to implement the changes.

 “The performing arts need to be saved now. Not next week, or next month. If they die, an ecosystem this intricate and evolved cannot be rebuilt from scratch. If it stops breathing, it cannot be resuscitated.
 “It is the product of decades of capital projects, loyal audiences, and of communities large and small,” the filmmaker wrote.
 Mendes took aim at the streaming services for profiting from the pandemic as people all over the world shut themselves in their homes to avoid getting infected from the disease.
 “While a huge percentage of working people have suffered over these past three months, there are also many (whisper it) whom Covid-19 has made rich.
 “It would be deeply ironic if the streaming services — Netflix, Amazon Prime et al — should be making lockdown millions from our finest acting, producing, writing and directing talent, while the very arts culture that nurtured that talent pool is allowed to die,” he added.
 Mendes wondered whether the streamers would be willing to share the profits they amassed during the lockdown to help the artistes.
 “Is there anyone among those people willing to use a fraction of their Covid-19 windfall to help those who have been mortally wounded? If so, I hope you’re reading this, and that you are able to think of the arts landscape as more than just a ‘content provider’, but instead as an ecosystem that supports us all,” he wrote.
 As part of his measures to help the industry, the filmmaker also urged the UK Government to become a “theatrical angel” as he called for an increase in the rate for theatre’s tax-relief scheme, from 20 per cent to 50 per cent.

If lawmakers believe the coronavirus gives them a blank check, they will try to take advantage of the crisis to spend money on wish-list items unrelated to the nation’s genuinely pressing concerns. Much less care will be given to how programs meant to respond to the crisis allocate money.
 This has become apparent. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi recently shepherded through the House a $3 trillion abomination of a bill that was ostensibly a response to the immediate needs of the pandemic. In reality, it was a wish list that included, among other things, a rescue of perennially mismanaged union pension funds. The bill also would have extended the temporary and excessive $600 weekly supplement to unemployment benefits until the end of January and removed the cap on deducting state and local taxes, to benefit blue states such as Pelosi’s home.
 President Donald Trump has talked about spending $2 trillion on a massive infrastructure bill that he’s struggled to get off the ground throughout his time in office.
 Meanwhile, the money is flying out the door so fast that there has not been adequate oversight.
 There’s an argument to be made for lots of spending as long as it is accurately targeted and fairly allocated. But when everybody operates as though they have limitless sums of money to play with, excessive spending and a misallocation of the nation’s wealth are going to become more prevalent.
 That’s why, even though the debt should not handcuff policymakers and prevent them from taking truly necessary actions to pull America out of its present crisis, concerns about debt must be made an important part of the conversation.

In 2014, Sarah Jackson, a Northeastern University professor focused on social movements told Politico that the civil rights movement focused on a "Martin Luther King - Al Sharpton model" of leadership. She asserted many social movements being centered around "a charismatic male leader."
 Columbia University's director of African-American politics Fredrick C. Harris once wrote that the model Jackson references had been replicated countless times, but by and large, "the dependence of movements on charismatic leaders can ... weaken them, even lead to their collapse."
 "Black Lives Matter activists today recognize that granting decision-making power to an individual or handful of individuals poses a risk to the durability of a movement," Harris wrote in 2015.

Selective activism has been all the rage recently, as many have pointed out how celebrities only speak on issues that take place on a global front and show a rising level of hypocrisy. However, in most cases when actors do speak up, they become the target of enormous online hate even if they're the ones who usually do speak up and are vocal of their opinions. The irony is, they're damned if they do and when they don't.
