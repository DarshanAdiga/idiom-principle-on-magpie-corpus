With the last one, the author counters it with the idea that you have to focus on what you’re saying and saying it with full confidence, passion, and belief. When you do that you will have given the impression of being truthful and trustworthy. In effect, your full presence of mind on what you’re doing and saying, versus being bogged down by what others are thinking, works to give you the benefit of exuding confidence and not having regrets.

I also add a drizzle of honey to the pan, and not just because of Rosh Hashana. Plum skins are notoriously tannic, and a little honey smooths things out. The combination of honey and spices gives the plums a chutneylike appeal, while the onions add a silky texture. Even better, as everything roasts, the plums absorb some of the savory chicken drippings, melting into a tangy, bright sauce that’s rich with schmaltz.

As I grew older my father began referring to me as a “King Maker”. I would see potential in something or someone and had the desire to help mold or turn them into something bigger using my vision. I could see things on a much larger scale, especially when it came to a person’s goals for them self. This worked very well in business but not so well in my personal life. Convincing a small business owner to trust the vision you have on the potential success of their project, was a lot easier than convincing someone you’re dating to do the same with their goals and future. There was a thin line with this gift of mine, and the more I learned this, the more I began directing the thing I was good at, into the right people and projects.

“I’ve never seen the ocean before, so that was pretty cool,” she said.
 From the drive through Thompson Pass to the colors of the ocean and the beauty of the mountains to the unexpected warm temperatures, Leverenz was soaking in the experience. “I was really amazed. It’s gorgeous. The water, it just looks different, the colors.”
 Leverenz caught a 12-pound silver her first day. It would have won the daily prize, but she hadn’t bought a derby ticket.
 “So the next day I was just like I might as well get a derby ticket just in case ... and I got a big fish,” she said.
 She was fishing from shore by the new Valdez boat harbor. She said she would use the money to buy parts for her truck and was already planning to return for the 2021 derby.
 When asked about the experience of winning $1,500, she said, “That’s just the cherry on the top.”
 John Oliver of Fairbanks won third place, with a 14.42-pound silver.
 In the Valdez Halibut Derby, Mickia Cenker of Fairbanks won $5,000 for the 224-pound halibut she reeled in on Aug. 16 during a charter on the Halibut Grove. Cenker said she didn’t realize just how big the fish was until the captain told her it was the biggest fish he had caught in 17 years, according to a news release from Valdez Fish Derbies.
 Cenker, who works in the emergency room at Fairbanks Memorial Hospital, is building a house and plans to put the prize money toward siding.
 Second place goes to Jim Rothenbuhler of Salcha, who caught a 201.2-pound halibut on June 23 aboard his boat The Bucketlist. He won $1,500. After he caught it, he told derby officials the secret to catching a big fish is to “Put the time in. If you’re willing to be patient, most of the time you’ll end up with nice fish,” he said. “Fishing is one of those things. You can hit it real hot one time one year and you think you have it figured out; and the next year you go back and you might as well of stayed in bed.
 “I think that that’s the magic of fishing is that you never know,” he said. “It’s always a challenge. It’s always a challenge to try and figure it out or at least be successful at it.”
 Kenny Tussey of North Pole brought home a 193.4-pound halibut on July 5 aboard the Dan Orion. He won $750.

DALTON TOWNSHIP – Politics, not unlike a boxing match, typically has two opponents; but unlike boxing punches aren’t traded and the deciding factor is based on popularity and not a one-two combo to the face.
 This November, two people will be on the ballot for the position of township treasurer — the incumbent Tammy Stephenson and the political newcomer Gerold Flater.
 What makes this election unusual is that for a number of years all of the political offices held in Dalton Township have all been democrats. Jeffrey Martin, the republican candidate for township supervisor, said in a previous interview that there hasn’t been a republican primary challenger since 2000.

Exercise is something that every single person needs in their lives for physical and mental health and it can look different for every person, but what so many of us get wrong about it is that it should be FUN and something we look forward to. You are more likely to make the time for exercising and stick to a routine if you enjoy what you are doing. Exercise is so much more than going to a gym or hitting the pavement running unless that is your jam and what you love to do. Exercising with purpose and passion is about finding something you love to do and making that your exercise, such as hiking, dancing, playing a sport, or group classes (socially distanced of course). Jazzy Canuelas, creator of the jazzymethod is bringing fun and energetic virtual exercise with a supportive community to your home. “jazzymethod is a combination of what I have learned from my life experiences. It’s my way of being, teaching, and the energy I share. It is all about balance, self-love, and fun,” said Jazzy. Virtual exercise is becoming a way of life during this pandemic, but even in a new normal as the world starts to reopen, it makes it possible to fit your workout in anywhere and at any time. Jazzy shares her fitness journey openly with her followers on Instagram and draws the connection between physical health and mental health, as they truly go hand in hand.

A spiritual (though sexier and more diverse) successor to both _The O.C._ and _Gossip Girl_ , with just a touch of _SKAM_ thrown in for good measure, Netflix’s Spanish-language Original Series _Élite_ (most often styled as E L I T ?, because of course it is!) is a teenage-class-warfare-lover’s dream. Featuring a sprawling ensemble cast of attractive Spanish twentysomethings, _Élite_ follows a trio of working class public school kids—one of them, a hijabi from an immigrant Palestinian family—as they transfer to Las Encinas, an academically elite (and extremely expensive) private school on a kind of “whoops, my bad” scholarship sponsored by some of the rich parents whose cost- cutting construction business was found to have been at fault for their public school literally collapsing. The class tensions and psychosexual dramas this move provokes would be more than enough to fill any sexy, A+ teen series with ( _Riverdale_ truly _wishes_ ). _Élite_ , however, is nothing if not expert in raising the stakes, each season framing these more quotidian (if highly stylized) teen dramas with a more explosive mystery—a brutal murder of a central member of the ensemble in Season 1, the bloody disappearance of another in Season 2, and the even bloodier death of a third in Season 3. By the end of the most recent season, alliances have fully swapped, ‘ships have been thoroughly mixed up, and allegiances have been pinned in every possible configuration. With two more seasons officially on the way—and who knows how many more possibly beyond those—the only thing we can really be certain of is that nothing at Las Encinas will ever be boring. — _Alexis Gunderson_

“We’ll need them to step up. And for the guys coming in it’s a perfect opportunity and you couldn’t ask for a bigger game to stake a claim in the first team for next season.”
 They set up the final-day decider thanks to a 126-run derby victory over Shenfield at the weekend thanks to a superb performance from Tom Oakley.
 Brentwood won the toss and elected to bat first, posting a score of 241-7 with Oakley (100) leading the way and getting support from Ben Sach (58).
 Shenfield could only manage 115 in reply, with Oakley (5-31) and Eddie Ballard (3-11) the stand-out bowlers and West added: “It was a great win, it probably wasn’t as easy as it looked on the scorecard.
 “We were in a bit of trouble at 70-5, but Tom Oakley played a matchwinning innings with the bat and was well supported by Ben Sach who’d come up from the second team.
 “He had scored three 100s in the second team lately and that gave us a decent score to defend.
 “Tom was magnificent with the ball again. I think he is possibly the first person to get 100 and five wickets in the Premier League in the same game for Brentwood.
 “Eddie has obviously been performing really well with the bat so considering he didn’t get any runs this week it was good to see him contribute with the ball.”

At an early age I knew that I was a little different from other kids. I was a creative child with an extremely wild and detailed imagination. I can remember building cities for my Barbies, and I would have entire lives planned out for them; from their appearance, to their careers, their individual personalities, even down to the way I wanted their “Barbie society” to view them. As I got older, the playtime stories I had created for my toys transformed into fictional characters that I was writing into books. During high school I wrote a novel titled, “Queen of Queens”. The book went viral before going viral was even considered a thing. I worked so hard on developing the characters for the novel, that my peers fell in love with them. I remember some of them even crying during lunch, after reading the chapter I wrote ending one of the characters’ lives. It was the first time I experienced my power to make other people feel emotions from something I created. The feeling was intoxicating, to say the least.

BARNSTABLE -- A new program has been set up to help Cape Codders keep up with their rent as the coronavirus pandemic continues.
 The Barnstable County HOME Tenant Based Rental Assistance Program has set $100,000 aside to help Cape residents not fall behind on their rent, the county Department of Human Services announced this week.
 "These funds fill an important gap in the assistance available through other programs," department director Beth Albert said. "Our primary concern is that people impacted by COVID-19 receive the support they need to remain in their homes."
 The new program will be administered by Housing Assistance Corp., which already has several related programs up and running. People may apply for all of the programs through a single application on HAC's website.
 "It's another resource we have for people in Barnstable County who are experiencing housing instability or are behind on their rent," Alisa Magnotta, the CEO of Housing Assistance, said.
 Eligible households can receive up to $6,000 to help with rent arrears. If the response to other programs is any indication, there appears to be a need.
 The Homeless Prevention Council is starting to see a rise in calls, CEO Hadley Luddy said. The council saw a significant increase in requests for assistance during its back-to-school backpack and school supplies program. She fears things could get worse once seasonal jobs start to disappear this fall.
 Both the council and Housing Assistance have seen an increase in the number of first-time clients who never thought they would need aid.
 "They don't even know where to turn," Magnotta said.
 The new county program is designed for people whose income has dried up because of the coronavirus, according to Renie Hamman, the HOME program coordinator. The county did not receive extra money for the emergency rental assistance but was able to allocate other funds from housing development toward the program through the end of the year.
 The new program also loosens restrictions on assistance, Hamman said. The program looks at what a person's income is currently, not overall. It allows assistance to go to people who had income coming in previously, but are not making money now and would be disqualified using metrics such as area median income.
 Housing advocates said this will be another piece in the puzzle to help people get through the pandemic-related shutdowns.
 "As a result of the pandemic, many people remain unemployed and are uncertain how they will pay their rent to stay in their home," said Patty Daley, a legal and policy specialist at the Cape Cod Commission. "This financial assistance will not only help to prevent homelessness, it will assist landlords who have been forgoing rental payments, which will support and stabilize the rental stock vital to the economic strength of the region."

He invited me to attend a meeting he was having that afternoon. When everyone was assembled, he said (looking at me), “we’re all here meeting to talk about…” and he concisely laid out what the parties were meeting about, and what they hoped to accomplish by meeting. It’s a lesson I still use today, and have taught countless others. It’s surprising how many people don’t know how to start a meeting well.

“We are not going to eliminate people, we will need to get young kids who are already digitalized. They are already trained. This is a way to get a young operator intrigued. Give them the tools and they will come back to the farm.”
 The quantum leap in ag production will come as the movement toward more healthy eating continues. “We eat so much processed food,” Horsch said. “This comes from us farmers in the last 50 years doing our job. We have allowed even the poorest of the poor in our Western societies to eat what they want. If we would slightly change our diets, we would dramatically change our health. The answer is already out there. If we don’t watch what is out there (the various food movements), we’ll be run over by it.
 “If I was a corn and soybean rotation farmer, I would start looking at slightly altering my rotation.”
 The answer, according to Horsch, is to come up with something that falls in between going totally organic but isn’t totally conventional farming.
 “Come up with a rotation that cuts back on chemicals — I’m not saying go organic — just rotate and work toward eliminating that emotional side of using herbicides,” he said.
 Horsch is calling the happy medium “hybrid farming,” or to use another buzzword, “regenerated farming.” He is developing a demonstration farm near Bloomington, Illinois, as a way of introducing the concept to the Corn Belt.
 “When we bring in all the things I discussed, diet and crop rotation, we will be sustainable,” he said.
 Unfortunately, the coronavirus has taken a lot of momentum out of their plans for Bloomington, he said, as he’s been unable to visit the farm this year.
 “So far we are implementing an organic farming piece there, starting with alfalfa in the rotation,” Horsch said. “Long-term the idea is to get out of the corn-soybean rat race and put in a few more crops, using both organic and conventional farming with a controlled traffic approach, which is controlling the number of trips through the fields.
 “Hopefully, we will find a better way of farming to match society’s future needs. At the end of the day, I care about my customers, but at the end of the day I also talk about things they don’t want to hear so they can plan for another day.”

Times change, and the methodology of detection grows ever more sophisticated. John Fox, the FBI’s official historian, recently reminded me that many crime cases are cracked in the modest seclusion of the laboratory, and drew attention to the work of forensic pioneers like Calvin Goddard, August Vollmer, and Francis Glessner Lee. Psychological work has also become more important over the years. John E. Douglas of the FBI’s Investigative Support Unit, whose interviewing skills perhaps surpassed even those of Turrou, patiently listened to Charles Manson and many other psychopaths who were behind bars. He looked for personality traits and behavioral patterns that would help with the identification of criminals who were still at large. The 1991 movie, _The Silence of the Lambs_ , starring Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins, won critical acclaim, and shone a rare ray of light on the utility of quietly practiced skills.

In recent years, Chinese leaders have called on the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) to carry out tasks related to naval diplomacy beyond maritime East Asia, in the "far seas." Designed to directly support broader strategic and foreign policy objectives, the PLAN participates in a range of overtly political naval diplomatic activities, both ashore and at sea, from senior leader engagements to joint exercises with foreign navies. These activities have involved a catalogue of platforms, from surface combatants to hospital ships, and included Chinese naval personnel of all ranks. To date, these acts of naval diplomacy have been generally peaceful and cooperative in nature, owing primarily to the service's limited power projection capabilities and China's focus on more pressing security matters closer to home. However, in the future a more blue-water capable PLAN could serve more overtly coercive functions to defend and advance China's rapidly growing overseas interests when operating abroad.

The end of his nine-year stay with the Carolina Panthers arrived last March 24, leaving Cam Newton a former most valuable player without a team.
 For three months after that move was made, the quarterback waited for a new door to open as he turned 31, but no takers were found through the NFL free agency process.
 "Pressure is when you're looking at your children and you're saying you're 31 and you're not ready to retire, but nobody's calling your phone,'' said Newton. "That's pressure when you don't have control of your destiny.''
 The long wait for a new opportunity arrived on the final weekend of June, though, when the Patriots agreed to a one-year contract with Newton.
 Not long before the start of training camp, a team that had lost legend Tom Brady to free agency brought in Newton, who was waived by the Panthers after dealing with injuries the past two seasons.
 And on Sunday afternoon at an empty Gillette Stadium, Newton will be starting against the Miami Dolphins after being unsure what the future held for him back in the spring.
 "I'm elated, I'm excited because I knew that if God didn't show favor over me, man, who knows where I would be right now,'' said Newton on a video conference this week. "And yet through it all, I'm going to smile through it because I'm going to love this whole moment. I just got rewarded with another chance and I've got to do right by it.
 "Two or three months ago, I was questioning a lot of things. Right now, as I'm looking at Gillette (Stadium name), and the iconic logo of the Patriots, how can I lose, know what I'm saying?
 "I was at my house working out every single day, and God has put me in this position I would not take for granted. I pray countless nights, I meditated countless days. I had so much counsel from my support cast.''
 Newton, who led the Panthers to the Super Bowl in 2015 when he was the NFL's MVP, missed the final two games of the 2018 season with a shoulder injury that required surgery.
 He started the first two games of the 2019 season but struggled and sat out the remaining 14 games due to a foot injury that needed surgery last December.
 The Panthers decided not to bring him back in 2020, giving Newton the chance to work out a trade, but after that didn't happen, he was waived in late March with the team saving $19 million in salary cap space.
 The Patriots had second-year quarterback Jarrett Stidham and journeyman Brian Hoyer as the players in line to replace Brady, but they saw Newton still on the free-agent market as summer began and brought him in.
 Only three other quarterbacks have started for the Patriots since Brady replaced an injured Drew Bledsoe early in the 2001 season, and now Newton will be taking over for the first-ballot Hall of Famer who is now with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
 "I've been here going on a month and a half,'' said Newton. "I'm ready. I know opening day, (Brady is) not going to really be worried about little old me and I know opening day I just have other things to be focusing on other than who was here before.
 "I have to do right by my opportunity that I do get and make the most of it.''
 Newton will become just the second Black quarterback to start a game for the Patriots, joining Jacoby Brissett, who started two games in the 2016 season when Brady was suspended and Jimmy Garoppolo was injured.
 Newton talked about growing up in Atlanta and how Michael Vick was his hero and how he looked up to other Black quarterbacks like Vince Young, Randall Cunningham, Donovan McNabb and Daunte Culpepper, among others.
 He knows the significance of being a Black quarterback in the NFL and for the Patriots, who played their first game 60 years ago this week at Boston University.
 "It's a big deal. It's really a big deal,'' said Newton. "I understand who I am. I understand being an African-American in this time, we have to be stronger. This is a great feat to achieve, but yet at the end of the day we've got to make sure we're using our platform for positive reasons and that's what I want to do.
 "I want to prove to people that there's more to a person than just what you see on the outer level. I'm a person who got second and third and fourth chances in my life and yet through it all, it should always be about what that person's about, not what that person looks like.
 "As long as I have this opportunity to impact and empower the community whether it's the Black community or the white community, it doesn't matter what community it may be, I just want to do my part as a good Samaritan.''
 Newton said his excitement level is at "1,000'' going into his first game since a Sept. 12, 2019 loss to the Buccaneers.
 He sat out 16 of the last 18 games with the Panthers due to injuries, so there is rustiness to deal with, especially after a shortened training game with no preseason games.
 "You've got to remember, I've been away from football for really a full year, 16 games,'' said Newton. "I missed the last two games of 2018 and only played two games of 2019, so that's an equivalent of a 16 games, so I haven't really had this whole process for a long time now.
 "Being around, taking notes, watching film, finding out about different players each and every day, locking in, (I'm) excited about the game plan and more excited about just trying to get in a routine with the newness of the play calling, the coaches and the players.''
 "I think right now where I'm at, I'm in a happy place. I feel motivated. I feel just a lot of great emotions that's going on that's not hindering me from becoming my best self. And yet through it all, I just like it most that I'm just a piece to the puzzle. I don't want to be the puzzle.''

My first window into the possibility that there might be another option available, was presented to me when strolling the isles at Borders (when bookstores still existed) and seeing a book titled, “A Good Enough Parent”. What’s that, I thought? Is it even _possible_ to be a good enough parent, and if so, why would anyone want to _aspire_ to that? I almost felt ashamed for that parent, even though I couldn’t even imagine her. The thought of others seeing me as good enough, as opposed to perfect, in any area of my life, simply seemed unacceptable. But as often happens, my curiosity won the day and I bought the book. I was now open to considering that there is a whole different mindset from which I can potentially build a life, that included all the things I love, but without the high cost I was paying in stress, anxiety, and ultimately physical illness. Slowly, I began the practice of being good enough in all areas of my life, not just parenting. Much to my surprise, my kids didn’t turn into criminals, my boss still appreciated my work, my parents still loved me, my significant other didn’t even notice the change (a good thing), and life began to feel lighter, more joyful, and relaxed. The dreadful constant feeling that at any moment, one or more of the balls I was keeping up in the air was going to drop with terrible consequences, lessened considerably. In time and through practice, I found that I was able to be far more present in my everyday life; a critical shift that had me experiencing a richer and more connected life.

The national government’s attempt to force districts to bring children, teachers and staff into school buildings in the midst of a raging pandemic without massive funding to make them safer complicates this issue, to say the least. This push looks like an obvious attempt to win votes in November by claiming a “return to normalcy.” The eloquent historian Heather Cox Richardson has another theory why our government would want to put millions of lives at risk. In a recent newsletter, she quotes U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos as saying, “If schools aren’t going to reopen, (the federal government should give funding) to the families to decide to go to a school that is going to meet that promise (of education).”

2020 has been a rough year so far for farmers. COVID-19 hurt commodities, sending prices lower. However, as the calendar shifts to September and crops start coming off the fields, Ed Usset, grain marketing economist for the University of Minnesota, says prices seem to be on the mend as of late.
 “The corn market bottomed out three weeks ago, with December corn getting as low as $3.20 per bushel, which put new crop bids as low as $2.70 to $2.80 in parts of southern and western Minnesota,” he said. “But we’re off of that now. December corn is trading at $3.59 (Aug. 27) and we’re almost back to the short rally we had in early July.”
 The jump off the bottom of the corn market is a combination of supply and demand issues, according to Usset.

Two weeks ago, the Gulf of Mexico, which appears to be one of the largest production areas of US Oil, was taken aback by magnanimous hurricane levels. Hurricane Laura approaches the Texas-Louisiana coast and many energy participants wondered how it will impact the energy sector as the areas affected is mostly important oil and petroleum area in America. There was a disruption in the Oil Production as around 1.6 million barrels per day of offshore crude oil production were stopped as production members in the Gulf of Mexico had fled the areas. That amounted to over 80% of U.S. offshore crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico. This affected inventories and sent prices up as supply was taken off the market.

To get you interested in YouTube’s new original comedy, Wayne, all I really need to say is that it’s basically John Wick meets John Hughes, with Wayne ( _Sing Street_ ’s Mark McKenna) as a kind of magnetically angsty cross between Ferris Bueller and Cameron Frye—you know, if instead of middle-class Chicago affluence and deep wells of self-interest, Ferris and Cameron had grown up in Brockton, Massachusetts with shit luck, no money, and a violent desire to make bad people pay, and if instead of a day playing hooky with cool girl Sloane in Cameron’s dad’s borrowed sports car, they’d helped a no-shit-taking neighbor girl (Del, played with deadpan genius by Ciara Bravo) kidnap herself away from an oppressively scary home situation by whisking her off on the back of a dinky motorcycle to Florida to steal a stolen sports car back.

We are exposed to toxins every day, just by simply living in this world. The air, our food, the chemicals in the products we use, etc. contain toxins and although we may try to limit our exposure they are still there and storing themselves in our bodies. In addition to exposure, our bodies are affected internally by metabolic waste, stress hormones, unbalanced diets, lack of hydration and so much more. Courtney Yeager, owner of The Tox developed “The Tox Technique” which is a unique blend of massage that stimulates the lymphatic system and drains out the toxins, bloat, and sludge stored in our bodies to leave you rejuvenated both physically and mentally. The lymphatic system is responsible for a network of tissues and organs that help to rid your body of toxins and waste in addition to transporting lymph (a fluid that contains infection-fighting white blood cells) throughout the body. This technique not only relaxes you and removes toxins from your body, but it also boosts the immune system. A pampering treatment can also stimulate our senses that we have lost touch with from scents, sounds, and touches, transporting us to a truly relaxing and refreshing experience. Pampering ourselves has been viewed as a luxury, but it should be thought of as a necessity in self-care.

1. Firstly, acknowledge that feelings of fear, anxiety, and loneliness are natural, subjective and ever-changing. As humans we experience a variety of emotions and none of them are neither good nor bad — they’re just emotions. Emotions are subjective, meaning that everyone experiences emotions differently, through the lens of their perceptions and life experience. How we experience emotions evolves as we evolve. It’s common to feel weak when we feel these powerful emotions, however this is us judging ourselves. Try being gentle with yourself by simply acknowledging your feelings. I recommend voicing your feelings internally or out loud. Speaking your emotions out loud can also calm your body by the sound of your voice.   2. Sit with your feelings, try not to run away from them. Your body will instinctively want to fight, flight, or freeze when experiencing these strong emotions. This is where you can begin to teach your body a different way to react. Sitting allows your emotions to move through you, building your body’s tolerance of this distress or discomfort. It’s like lifting weights for your brain, the more you can sit through distress, the more tolerant your brain becomes to experience these difficult emotions. After consistent, predictable, and controlled practice — your distress tolerance will increase. Just remember, it will be uncomfortable at first, like working out.   3. Begin to notice any negative thoughts you’re having and begin to challenge them. Some automatic thoughts such as “I’m weak”, “I’m worthless”, “nobody cares about me”, “I’m not good enough to love.” These are all harsh, but fairly common, negative statements that get too much play time in our heads and maintain loneliness. When faced with chronic stress, our brain is constantly on the look-out for threat. Imagine a lion in tall grass, on the look-out for its next prey. This is what your brain’s doing — looking for its next threat to pounce on. Challenge these thoughts by balancing the evidence that supports and contradicts these thoughts. The goal of not spinning negative thoughts positive, but instead neutralizing and controlling them. This sounds easier than it is and requires practice- regular practice. The negative self-talk in your head is a habit which now requires intentional practice to shift.   4. Make one small promise to yourself every day, that’s realistically achievable, and keep it. Remember, your body wants to control, predictability and consistency. During the uncertainty of this lock down, your body may feel out of control and has lost trust in your ability to protect it. You can regain this trust by making promises and keeping them. Your body and brain will learn to trust that you can protect it and it won’t need to react with fight, flight or freeze. Start small and simple- like taking a shower each day, applying facial moisturizer, or putting on deodorant. Let’s keep it real, many of us working from home have stopped these daily habits. Even though you may have nowhere to go, try to do these simple self-care strategies to begin to take back control of your body and reactions.   5. Lean in on your relationships — family, friends, lovers, neighbors and new connections. This likely seems easier said than done, when all you may want to do is hide in a hole. Humans are social mammals which crave connection. When distressed our bodies can heal by connecting with others. From a neuroscience perspective, our nervous systems co-regulate with other nervous systems to cope effectively through distress together. Therefore, by engaging our social networks we inhibit our fight/flight/freeze responses and will experience distress more smoothly. When it comes to social support, quality is better than quantity. Be mindful of who you seek support from and be mindful of your boundaries in relationship, trying not to take on too much of the emotional heavy lifting of others when you’re barely staying afloat yourself. Know that it’s ok if you choose not to connect with certain close relationships. Begin to notice who you are resonating towards or distancing from. Relationships evolve and the COVID crisis may be a litmus testing your relationships. Considering the number of virtual opportunities, the lock down can be an opportunity to forge new connections. It can be hard, intimidating and daunting to forge new relationships (particularly the older we get). So, take it slow, start small, and be selective of who you choose to befriend. Take the time to explore new ways of interacting with others and building connections.

When MTV announced they were making a series based on the ridiculous 1985 Michael J. Fox comedy of the same name, I was less than excited. It would be like someone suggesting that it was a good idea to make a series based on 1992’s execrable _Buffy The Vampire Slayer_ film. Oh, wait… What I mean is, it’s hard enough to make a good show out of a _good_ film and for every _Friday Night Lights_ or _Fargo_ , there are a dozen _Ferris Bueller_ or _Clueless_ debacles. But using a bad film as source material? You damned well better tweak the hell out of it. Well, wouldn’t you know it? Jeff Davis did just that and has pulled a particularly fearsome were rabbit out of his hat. _Teen Wolf_ is a genuinely terrifying and unapologetically sexy piece of work. (While I’ll admit to a teenaged crush on Boof from the original film, the series raises the lascivious lupine bar a few dozen notches.) Of course with a series, one runs out of source material rather quickly. But Davis and his team have done their homework and created an intriguing and well thought out world, complete with magic, banshees, were-coyotes and even kitsune, populated by a surprisingly talented group of young actors. Like Sunnydale and Mystic Falls before it, Beacon Hills seems to be a magnet for mystical happenings and things that go “Grrrrr” in the night and thankfully we’ve got Scott (Tyler Posey), Stiles (Dylan O’Brien) and the rest to at least _try_ and make sense of it all.— _Mark Rabinowitz_

To attempt to single out America’s greatest detectives is to encounter many twists and turns. Take, for example, the case of U.S. Secret Service chief Hiram C. Whitley. In 1871, the government gave the Secret Service the mission of penetrating the Ku Klux Klan, which at the time was terrorizing freedmen in the South and their white allies. With the assistance of some incredibly brave black informers, Whitley did a brilliant job, and U.S. marshals arrested the Klan’s ringleaders. Whitley was effective, and was famous – at least, he was infamous in the South. The task he undertook was highly moral, and compares with Turrou’s campaign against the Nazis. Yet Whitley was not a morally committed detective. Indeed, one reason for his success was that he was poacher turned gamekeeper, as he had been a slave catcher before the war. Turrou, by comparison, believed in his cause.
