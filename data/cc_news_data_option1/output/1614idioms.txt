_Grey Goose is certainly one of the most popular vodkas, but I feel it is also the best because it is one of the cleanest vodkas in terms of its flavor profile. Grey Goose is served best extra chilled with just a lemon twist or enjoyed "down and dirty" with a good dose of olive juice and garnished with our signature two blue cheese stuffed olives.

Being Jewish and culturally conservative was the huge overarching story of my family life, which was totally controlled by my mom. I fought it endlessly, and I really resented the way the religion eclipsed many values that I felt on a personal level. Like the expectation that we were supposed to “marry Jewish” when we went to school with mixed kids, almost none of them Jewish. We were really caught between worlds. And to add to that, my parents were involved in the gay counterculture, something I only realized much, much later. At first I was really pissed off at the obvious hypocrisy, and it was fodder for my own rebellion. But at the same time, I felt a sense of pride.

He was also fascinated by Emile Zola’s trailblazing fiction novel _Germinal_ at the time. Echoing the novel, Van Gogh’s interpretation of this “human nest” of a house is both an uncompromising social comment and an affectionate tribute to the human spirit. In a letter to his brother Theo, the post-impressionist wrote: “those two cottages, half decayed under one and the same thatched roof, reminded me of a couple of worn-out old folk who make up just one single being and whom one sees supporting each other.”

Through a variety of circumstances, Christine Sinclair finds herself in Florida these days. But as she weathers the COVID-19 lockdown, her heart remains in Canada.
 And the global pandemic strikes close to home for the native of Burnaby, B.C. Her mother, who has multiple sclerosis, lives in a care facility in suburban Vancouver.
 "There are no known cases where she is at, so that's positive," said Sinclair.
 The Canada soccer captain is particularly grateful for all those on the frontline during the pandemic. But she knows that everyone can do their part.
 "For a lot of people, that means actually doing something pretty simple — staying at home." she said. "Even as difficult as that is at times. I know for me why I do it and my family does it is for people like my mom. Those are the vulnerable people in society right now."
 "It's about saving lives," she added.
 The world's leading international goal-scorer is showing her support and appreciation through the Canadian Olympic Committee's "We Are All Team Canada" campaign.
 "My family and I are thankful for the heroes who are risking it all to keep us safe. Now more than ever," Sinclair tweeted alongside a photo of a homemade Maple Leaf sign and those of her two nieces.
 "They're all about art and helping out," Sinclair said proudly. "They thought it was pretty special."
 Sinclair joins the likes of hockey icon Hayley Wickenheiser, basketball star Kia Nurse, former news anchor Peter Mansbridge, trampoline gymnast Rosie MacLennan and music's Arkells in posting motivational messages to flatten the curve and show appreciation.
 "It's time for us to unite and work together even though we are apart," the COC says in explaining the campaign. "It's time for us to show our support for Canada and all those who are making sacrifices to make a difference."
 The COC calls Sinclair "the perfect ambassador for this campaign given her selfless nature and the enduring qualities she's exhibited on the soccer field."
 The 36-year-old Sinclair ended up in Florida via Charlie, her Pomeranian dog which she had entrusted to a friend while on international duty with Canada.
 After playing in the Tournoi de France March 4-10 in Calais, she flew back to Florida to reunite with Charlie and spend a few days in the sun before returning home to Portland, Ore., where she captains the NWSL Thorns.
 Because France was a COVID-19 hot spot, she had to go into 14-day self- isolation upon landing in North America. Then the pandemic descended.
 "I didn't want to have to travel until I had to. I'm in a pretty good place here," said Sinclair. "And you could just see that the NWSL (pre-season) training was going to stop and (the season) was going to get postponed."
 She hadn't been home in Portland since December due to the CONCACAF Women’s Olympic Qualifying Championship in Texas and California and the tournament in France.
 "So I'm in Florida," she said. "Which isn't a bad place to be, with the weather. It's actually helped a lot ... It's definitely nice to be running in 35-degree (Celsius) weather."
 The Thorns were due to open the season last Saturday against Utah Royals FC with a game this weekend in Chicago against the Red Stars.
 Adding to her record goals haul is on hold for the moment. Sinclair has 186 career goals, surpassing retired American striker Abby Wambach's world record of 184 on Jan. 29 at the CONCACAF Olympic qualifying tournament.
 Having led Canada to back-to-back bronze medals at the Olympics, Sinclair still has her eye on Tokyo despite the games being pushed back to 2021. When news of the postponement came, her immediate thought was "OK, we've got another year to get better."
 "Because there's some gaps in our team right now compared to the best teams in the world," Sinclair said of her eighth-ranked squad. "It just gives us a chance to get better."
 She was quick to connect with her Canadian teammates via their chat group.
 "Ideally we didn't want to be preparing for the Olympics in apartments or trying to find random grass patches in cities. It just wasn't ideal," she said.
 "Yes, I was very proud of the COC for kicking the sands as they did. And I'm also glad the Olympics actually got postponed because it's the only thing that made sense."
 In the meantime, Sinclair is training in the Sunshine State until the NWSL gives the green light for the pre-season to start.
 "It's been a weird opportunity to probably get fitter," she said. "I'm probably more of a runner now after the past six weeks, which isn't the most fun but I've definitely put in the work."
 And three times a week she takes part in video workouts with the national team under the guidance of strength and conditioning coach Cesar Meylan.
 "And then in terms of soccer I have been kicked off fields here in Tampa along with Tom Brady," she said with a laugh, referencing the Tampa Bay star quarterback who was asked to leave a closed park while doing an off-season workout.
 "But I have found a couple little grass patches that seem OK, so I've been able to take balls out and stuff like that. Just trying to make the most of it."
 While not working out, Sinclair has done some binge-watching — like everyone else.
 "I am embarrassed to admit that I watched 'Tiger King,'" she said.
 Sinclair also made her way through "Manhunt," finishing the second season in one night.
 That's impressive, she was told. "That's pathetic," she replied with a laugh.

The primary change is that these interviews will be taking place remotely; so instead of going and meeting your interviewer, you will now be doing your interview online. Although this may not be ideal for either the candidates or interviewers, it is the new normal for now, so we will all just have to adapt. If you look on the bright side, without the travel time you can conduct multiple interviews in one day from the comfort of your home.

I was totally hesitant about doing it—so much so that when I set out to make the film, I didn’t think I should even direct it myself. Initially, I worked in tandem with my producer Cynthia Childs to co-direct. But the process really forced all of our hands. Often, the best lines would come when I was sitting behind the camera: People like Larry Flynt and Jeff Stryker wanted to talk to only me and tell me what my parents meant to them. It was very personal. The story really directed itself. My job as the director was to just guide the ship—and at many points it was guiding itself.

_Overwatch is my favorite game right now. That was the first one that I started streaming, I jumped into Fortnite for a little bit, but I found that the skill gap just became too much. There are 12-year-olds who are just gaming all day that are better than the pros. So Overwatch is still my go-to, and I’m better at it than anything else too. I really enjoy the Battle Royales. And this one I can play after taking a break, and still manage to stay competitive. I play games towards the end of the day, once I am done with playing songs for the fans. I usually end up playing with people from the channel, set up some 6 ×6 matches, and get going._
