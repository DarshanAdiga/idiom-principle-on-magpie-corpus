The current president is, at a visceral level, a con man. Misdirection is his stock-in-trade.                                                                                            A classic refutation of misdirection was found on the Resolute desk during Harry S. Truman's term of office. "The Buck Stops Here" declared Truman's intention to assume responsibility for whatever landed on that desk. "Landed" literally or otherwise, to include anything that even vaguely suggested a need for national leadership.                                                                                            The current president assumes responsibility for nothing. Scratch that. He happily pounces on a responsibility for the successes of others. He uses the pronoun "we" to laud the accomplishments of governors left on their own to combat COVID-19.                                                                                            Which brings us to the perverse genius of his latest con. And, sadly, its lethality.                                                                                            The federal government (aka the current president's administration) has issued guidelines for combating COVID-19. He has mouthed his support for the guidelines with feigned solemnity. It must be feigned because he cannot seem to stay on message. He keeps cheers on governors who have in varying degree dismissed the guidelines and exhorts other governors to do likewise.                                                                                            But, here's the beauty part. If you're a sociopath.                                                                                            You win either way.                                                                                            More people will die because the guidelines are being shirked. On May 4, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) doubled its projection of deaths (by Aug. 1) because it could no longer assume that states and individuals would abide by the federal guidelines.                                                                                            [BTW, try to find, now, the IHME hyperlink on the CDC's webpage. It's no longer there. Hmmmm ...]                                                                                            But if you're the current president you don't need to care. If the projections are too high, you get to crow that your cheering and exhortations were prescient. If the projections are too low, you get to blame governors for not following your administration's guidelines.

Fieldman is studying for a master’s degree in health and human services management at Deacon University in Melbourne. She also works in the health and wellness department of a private health insurance company.                                            She first visited Australia in 2017 after graduating from Oregon State University in 2016. She had planned to travel to Thailand instead, for a scuba diving trip with a friend. But when the friend had to have shoulder surgery, and she was on her own, she picked a country where she could scuba dive, but also feel safe traveling on her own. Australia fit the bill.                                            She loved it so much that she obtained a one-year work visa so she could spend more time in the country. Then she fell in love and decided to stay.                                            Fieldman said Australians have been in lockdown and under a travel ban for almost two months, but the payoff has been a very low infection rate.                                            Australia has 6,833 COVID-19 cases as of this week and 93 deaths from the disease. Of course, Australia’s population is smaller than that of the United States. But even so, it had about 271 cases per million at the time of our interview, compared with 3,145 cases per million in the U.S.                                            Anyone who tests positive for the disease is placed in a government quarantine, and people caught traveling for nonessential reasons can face heavy fines.                                            In addition to the lockdown, Fieldman attributes Australia’s low COVID-19 infection rate to the federal government’s centralized, coordinated response to the pandemic and to its public health system.                                            There is no shortage of tests, and anyone with symptoms is encouraged to get one.                                            Also, in Australia, everyone is on Medicare. That means there’s no payment for basic health care like emergency room visits and primary care, guaranteeing everyone a basic level of safety.                                                                     *[FT]: Financial Times

Juba, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 8th May, 2020 ) :South Sudan's main rivals were at loggerheads Friday over who will control the country's 10 internal states, an issue that analysts and diplomats worried could jeopardise a power-sharing deal reached earlier this year.                             President Salva Kiir and rebel leader Riek Machar, old foes whose fallout in 2013 sparked civil war, agreed in February to form a new government after intense international pressure to deliver lasting peace to the conflict-torn country.                             But while they managed to name a cabinet in March, they have yet to strike a deal on who can appoint governors to the states.                             On Thursday night Kiir announced a breakthrough on the states issue, saying his party would appoint six governors while Machar's would appoint three.                             The remaining state would be governed by the South Sudan Opposition Alliance, a grouping of opposition parties.                             But Machar responded with his own statement saying the purported deal was "not a decision taken by consensus".                             "As far as we are concerned the deadlock on the allocation of the states still stands," the statement said.

“The pandemic exposed how little corporations pay many workers, workers on whom the public deeply depends,” John Grant, president of United Food and Commercial Workers Local 770 in California, said in a release. “With all eyes on essential workers during the pandemic, grocery corporations were quick to capitalize on the good PR of raising wages, but they cannot justify taking them away, especially since they have continued to do business while so many other businesses are closed and their profits are record high.”            Cincinnati-based Kroger was one of the last major supermarket chains to introduce some type of bonus or hazard pay. Safeway, Albertson’s, Walmart, Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods had already done so in prior weeks after employees expressed concern about customers and staffers spreading the coronavirus and their fear of coming to work.            Sara Osborne, a spokeswoman for Safeway and Albertson’s, said Friday: “At this point, there is no firm end date for our ‘Appreciation Pay.’ ’’            Walmart employees are receiving a $2 an hour raise through at least May 25, but the company has yet to confirm whether it will be extended. The company last week provided employees a one-time bonus adding up to $1.9 million for its Washington-based workers and $180 million nationwide.            At Seattle-based PCC Community Markets, the nation’s largest community owned chain of food markets, a $2 hourly bonus has been in place since March 16 and is due to end Saturday. PCC spokeswoman Kristen Woody said the company has been re-evaluating extensions on a weekly basis and as of Friday morning had yet to decide whether to continue the program into next week.            In her statement to The Seattle Times confirming the QFC and Fred Meyer decision to end bonus pay, spokeswoman Sanders mentioned Kroger has invested more than $700 million toward employee bonuses and to protect them and customers.            She said the protective measures include gloves and face coverings for every associate, plexiglass shields at checkout stands, floor decals for social distancing and emergency leave for associates diagnosed with COVID-19. By mid-May, she added, Kroger hopes to offer coronavirus testing to employees based on symptoms and medical need.

“People who obsessively watch cable television now obsessively get to peek into the homes of the people they watch obsessively," said Heilemann, editor-in-chief of “The Recount.” He says it all adds up to an “intimacy" that wasn't there before.            That intimacy was on display during last month's NFL draft, typically held in a public place with players dressed in their finest darting onto a stage like stars accepting Oscars the minute their names are announced.            This year, though, produced a look at NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's den and the living rooms of players, coaches and executives. They even got a look at a bathroom in one coach's home — complete with someone who apparently forgot to close the door.            The ratings were the best they've ever been. Yes, people are hungry for sports, but perhaps the padlocked stadiums don't explain everything.            “What people are looking for, hungry for, is something that appears spontaneous and behind the scenes,” said Irving Rein, a professor of communication studies at Northwestern University. “You are seeing these players in a natural setting, seeing what kind of life produced these star players."            The online rooms have also created a connection between interviewees and viewers. Take New York Times reporter Peter Baker. After Room Rater commented that the picture hook behind him had no picture, Baker tweeted that he had been sufficiently shamed and asked his wife to put something on the wall. The move impressed Room Rater enough to raise Baker's score (before dropping it again because one picture was hanging from the back of a door).            Others are more proactive.            CNBC analyst Bob Pisani has taken to subbing out his posters of the Grateful Dead, Jimi Hendrix and other rock stars with each appearance. During the NFL draft, analyst Desmond Howard made sure that when it was his turn to talk, a different record album was in view.            And Singaporean academic and former diplomat Kishore Mahbubani wants everyone to know he now recognizes that positioning himself for an interview so that one copy of his new book, “Has China Won?” could be seen over his left shoulder and another over his right was a bit much. “I learned my lesson,” he said after critical comments from friends.            Kristol relocated to a “more presentable” living room for subsequent appearances, though he said the move from his study prompted emails that asked him what kind of message was he trying to send with the book about Mozart behind him. Still, that one appearance prompted a suggestion from family members to use some of this time at home to tidy up his study.            “I think I should so I can find things better,” he said. “Not too much, but a bit of cleaning.”            Heilemann has taken a different tack. “Limes and jalapeno peppers,” he tweeted when questions about what was behind him popped up on Room Rater. And, he admitted in an email to the AP: “Yes, I do sometimes switch the fruit around (and add the occasional Easter egg) just to mess with the home-backdrop obsessives.”

The flip-flop in a country known for respecting privacy epitomizes the challenges faced by many governments about how to strike the right balance among public health, privacy and livelihoods as they adjust to the new normal presented by the pandemic — and gradually reopen businesses.            In neighboring Austria, Tourism Minister Elisabeth Koestinger said restaurant-goers won't be required to register. They will be asked to reserve in advance, though, so restaurant owners can plan better.            Swiss Home and Health Minister Alain Berset sought to clear up the Swiss conundrum at a news conference Friday, saying a “protection plan” called for operators of restaurants or bars to seek the details of at least one contact person per table in case a coronavirus case turned up there.            “Customers will be invited to participate, give their names, but it will remain voluntary, optional, with regard to data protection,” he said.            Swiss restaurant and bar owners who are eager to reopen had dreaded another requirement as they already faced headaches like staffing uncertainties, doubts about whether customers will show, the need to make disinfectant available and a requirement to increase spacing between tables.            In an interview published Friday in Le Temps newspaper, hours before the government reversed course, Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner Adrian Lobsiger said there was no legal basis to require restaurateurs to obtain personal data from diners. He reluctantly admitted the government could still create such a legal basis, by using emergency powers.

“It is incumbent on planners to learn as much as possible about the solutions out there that can deliver on objectives attached to specific meetings,” says Lisa Block, executive vice president of conference strategy & design at Velvet Chainsaw Consulting. This would include getting demos or case studies from tech suppliers and testimonials from planners who had similar objectives for their virtual meetings. From there, “a planner must create the right expectations for all stakeholders and then follow through,” Block says. “If you conduct a meeting that touts the bells and whistles but then you don’t use them adequately, it’s not only a waste of time and money but you’re also going to disappoint people. Then it’s harder to get buy-in from both executives and attendees on using the virtual medium in the future.”

  On April 19, I saw on Facebook a post that a truck driver had lost his cat at Walmart. He had contacted the sheriff’s office and gave them his contact number and description of the lost cat. I called the sheriff’s office and they told me the cat’s name was Gutter, it was black and white, recently shaved, had no teeth and was approximately 14 years old. I called the number but the person who answered said he had not lost a cat.


  So I decided to go to Facebook to see if this man had an account. I received a call from Claire Windle who said she would start looking on Google to see what she could come up with. Judy Johnson called and asked if she could do anything to help. I made up business cards with all of the information and to call immediately if they spotted a black and white cat. Judy then went to all the drive-through fast food restaurants on both sides of the interstate as well as the motels and gas stations and handed out the cards.

The owners’ associations of New Market, Chandni Chawk and Gausia took the decision on Friday even after the government allowed the malls to reopen on May.                                            Chandrima Super Market shop owners will take a decision on Saturday, but they are likely to follow suit.                                            Aminul Islam Shaheen, the president of New Market Shop Owners’ Association, said they had wanted to reopen the shops on a limited scale because they needed money for their families.                                            “But we’ve lost the courage to reopen as the number of infection in rising daily,” he said.                                            Shaheen also said he sees no chance of reopening the shops considering the health safety of the customers, salespeople and risks of a bigger outbreak.                                            Nizam Uddin, who heads the shop owners’ association of Chandni Chawk, said they would have been able to slightly offset the losses had they resumed trade.                                            “Why would customers come to shops in this situation? No chance,” he said.                                            Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi also said on Thursday the likelihood of people crowding the malls for Eid shopping is next to nothing.                                            The malls in New Market area draw a huge number of customers from different parts of the capital and beyond before Eid.                                            But on Thursday, Dhaka Metropolitan Police said no one will be allowed to shop in malls that are more than two kilometres away from their homes.                                            Manjur Ahmed Manju, the president of Chandrima Super Market Traders’ Association, said they had wanted to allow the shops to reopen if they wanted to.                                            “But the other malls have decided to keep the shops closed and asked us to do the same.

New Delhi, May 8 (PTI) Smartphone major Xiaomi on Friday unveiled its flagship 5G handset - Mi 10 - that features a 108MP quad-camera setup as well as a content streaming device and wireless earbuds as it looks to further strengthen its presence in the connected devices market in India.                                The launch comes at a time when the smartphone industry has been hit by the COVID-19 outbreak.                                "With Mi aim to redefine the premium smartphone experience for consumers in India. With its flagship OIS enabled 108MP Quad Camera setup, UHD 8K video recording, world's fastest 30W wireless charging, we hope our users can create content in a way never thought possible before, with Mi 10," Xiaomi India Managing Director Manu Kumar Jain said at the launch event.                                He added that the company plans to bring multiple devices under the Mi brand to India this year.                                Earlier this year, Xiaomi had said it intended to offer more premium experiences to customers via the Mi brand. Its Redmi franchise of devices would offer more mass market products, while Mi devices will focus on innovation and flagship features.                                The Mi 10 5G features a 108MP quad-camera setup, Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 chipset for 5G connectivity, 8GB RAM, 4,780mAh battery, and 30W wireless charging. It will come in two memory variants - 128GB (Rs 49,999) and 256GB (Rs 54,999) and will go on sale across platforms on May 18.                                According to analysts, smartphone shipments grew 1.5-4 per cent in the March quarter, and demand in the smartphone category is expected to revive only by the third quarter. After 40 days of lockdown, which began on March 25, certain business activities like opening of standalone stores and e-commerce delivery of non-essential items have been allowed in Green and Orange Zones (locations with few or no COVID-19 cases). Companies are also looking at resuming production after getting necessary approvals from state governments.                                Xiaomi, on Monday, had said it expects production of its smartphones in the country to return to normal capacity by next month, and demand returning by third quarter (July-September). It has also introduced an offline-to-online solution called "Mi Commerce" for its retail partners to help customers discover and buy products offline while staying at home.                                There has been a significant growth in consumption of content via digital platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. While the company has its range of smart TVs, it has launched the Mi Box 4K to woo users who have non-smart TVs but want to consume online video services.                                Xiaomi's Android TV streaming media player, which will compete with devices like Amazon Fire TV Stick, supports 4K Ultra high definition video content playback.                                Running on the latest Android TV version (9.0), Mi Box 4K allow users to access content from platforms like Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+Hotstar, YouTube as well as over 5000 apps/games on the Google Play store.                                Mi Box 4K comes with built-in Chromecast that allows users to cast up to 4K Ultra-HD content from mobile, tablet or laptops (Windows/MacOS) onto the TV screen. Priced at 3,499, Mi Box 4K has a 2GB RAM, 8GB of flash storage and will be available from May 10.

Nach mehreren vergeblichen öffentlichen Aufrufen bleibt Connor nur noch eine Chance: Bei einem nächtlichen Einbruch in San Franciscos FBI-Quartier gleicht er die DNA seines Sohnes mit den gespeicherten Gen-Proben inhaftierter Kapitalverbrecher ab.      Fündig wird er lediglich bei einem einzigen Mann - dem mehrfachen Mörder und Gewaltverbrecher Peter McCabe (Michael Keaton). Die Aussicht auf seine Verlegung ins Krankenhaus kommt dem hochintelligenten McCabe wie gelegen, also stimmt er einer Transplantation zu. Nach intensiver Vorbereitung gelingt ihm kurz vor der OP die Flucht. Aus Sorge um die Zivilbevölkerung erteilt Einsatzleiter Cassidy (Brian Cox) sofort den Befehl, McCabe mit allen Mitteln unschädlich zu machen. Für Frank Connor beginnt nun eine wilde Hatz, denn er muss McCabe unbedingt lebend stellen, um so das Leben seines Sohnes zu retten.      Nachdem er seine Karriere in den 70er-Jahren mit mehreren aufsehenerregenden Dokumentarfilmen begonnen hatte ("General Idi Amin", 1974), entdeckte der französische Regisseur Barbet Schroeder in den Neunzigern plötzlich seine Vorliebe für psychologisch ausgefeilte Thriller. Nach dem Überraschungserfolg von "Weiblich, ledig, jung sucht ..." (1992) folgten in geringen Abständen die starbesetzten Produktionen "Kiss of Death" (1995) und "Davor und danach" (1996).      Mit "Desperate Measures" (1998) erhielt Schroeder erstmals die Chance, einen stärker actionbetonten Film zu inszenieren. "Was mir an diesem Genre so gut gefällt", erklärte Schroeder einmal im Interview, "ist die Tatsache, dass diese Art von Filmen einen wieder zu den Ursprüngen des Filmemachens zurückbringt. Alles muss konstruiert werden. Die Bilder, die Geschichte, das Set - jede Einzelheit zwingt dich dazu, jederzeit alles über jede bevorstehende Szene zu wissen."

"From an efficient market perspective, any fundamental reaction to the halving should be heavily priced in at this point; after all, it's hard to imagine a more predictable event than an unalterable supply reduction that has been scheduled for more than a decade in a liquid, heavily-traded ... asset," said Matt Weller, global head of market research at GAIN Capital.                                            Bitcoin relies on so-called "mining" computers that validate blocks of transactions by competing to solve mathematical puzzles every 10 minutes. In return, the first to solve the puzzle and clear the transaction is rewarded new bitcoins.                                            Bitcoin's technology was designed in such a way that it cuts the reward for miners in half every four years, a move meant to keep a lid on inflation.                                            The mining reward is currently 12.5 bitcoins per block mined. In this week's halving, the reward will fall to 6.25 new bitcoins.                                                                     *[FT]: Financial Times

Against this backdrop, we have reduced discretionary expenses and digitized customer service delivery to optimize our cost structure. This resulted in a 1.6% reduction in operating costs this quarter, which drove positive wireline EBITDA growth of 0.5% and a 50 basis point improvement in margin.

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — New Mexico already was among the most poverty-stricken states in the U.S. before oil prices crashed and the coronavirus outbreak derailed efforts to diversify the economy. Now, more than 130,000 have lost their jobs or had their hours cut, putting more pressure on families and food banks that have served as the state's safety net. A stream of volunteers helps daily to sort, label and pack tons of food inside a giant warehouse in Albuquerque for distribution throughout the region as more people seek assistance. Roadrunner Food Bank has sent out more than 7.3 million pounds (3,311 metric tons) of canned food, dry goods, fruits and vegetables over the last two months, marking a 20% increase over the same period last year. Fresh faces in the line at the food pantries range from professionals who have been laid off to graduate students who are no longer getting stipends to help with expenses. “It's all over the map in terms of who is showing up,” said Sonya Warwick, a spokeswoman for the food bank. “We're meeting brand new clients who have exhausted their savings.

That's a nearly 40% increase from the previous week and magnitudes higher than a year ago. Overall, about one in six New Mexico workers have filed claims since mid-March. Nationally, the unemployment rate hit 14.7% in April, the highest rate since the Great Depression.

MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 08th May, 2020) The entire cryptocurrency market capitalization and value of its main currency, Bitcoin (BTC), will continue to rally supporters by the upcoming "halving" event and also after proving its immunity to economic fluctuations caused by panic and an assault on the global economy amid a new COVID-19 virus pandemic, international experts told Sputnik.


  The price of Bitcoin rose to more than $10,000 on Friday for the first time since February 19, according to CoinMarketCap data. With the Bitcoin halving on the horizon on 12 May, the crypto community and experts are currently engaged in a heated debate about how the ongoing pandemic and the upcoming event could affect the price of the cryptocurrency.


  "The upcoming Bitcoin halving event now has more attention than previous years, therefore, making it very interesting to see just how the market responds. In my opinion, I see Bitcoin making huge leaps and bounds in the coming year following the next halving. This is a very significant event for Bitcoin and will create a much higher demand than previously experienced or anticipated. We will see a surge in the price for some time to come but what that price will be is anyone's guess," Instant Crypto exchange Changelly CEO Eric Benz said.


  The term "halving" means that in less than 3 days, bitcoin miners will receive only half the reward going forward. This cuts in half the rate at which new Bitcoin is released into circulation and used as a synthetic form of inflation that halves every four years until all BTC are released and are in circulation. It is expected that this mechanism will continue until around 2140.


  According to another trader expert in crypto, Lukasz Radawiec from Poland, the 'halving' is a long awaited and timed event and any existing business should be prepared for the outcome a long time before it occurs to mitigate its negative effects. He questioned whether there would be enough buying pressure after all the halving euphoria is finished, reminding that the price of bitcoin has just fully recovered from the price crash in March.


  He said in an interview to Sputnik that he remained skeptical about dramatic boost in BTC price in a short term, pointing that the world is facing economic recession while bitcoin is still a high-risk asset class.


  "A lot of professional investors are closing their positions before summer season starts and that can also decrease buying pressure. Thus, miners [who can put buying pressure and boost the price] are not the only players or reason to be taken in consideration when analysing price," he said, adding that in short-term the economic fluctuations would cause huge price volatility.


  "We have already seen bitcoin's price crashing along with USA stock market in March and its recovery right after. These are definitely the one of most risky times to invest but at the same time can be very profitable," the expert stressed.


  His long term prognosis, however, is more optimistic. He explained that the way the bitcoin was designed was to increase in price in the long term. However, that should absolutely not determine anybody's investment decision, Radawiec said.


  "Investing during wrong moment of market cycle or simply 'when the price is close to historical highs' is always very bad decision and can financially ruin anybody. A person not familiar with the way financial markets are operating may be caught in this long term price increase narrative and buy the bitcoin at a price that will be not be seen for another 60 years, if ever," he said.


  It is obvious that an abrupt slowdown of economic activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic, often referred as the most dramatic event since World War II, will effect all markets.


  The crypto community, however, remains optimistic, pointing that this is the situation where bitcoin comes in with its underlying technology and monetary system that make it one of the few investable assets that is to some extent immune to the economic fluctuations.


  "Bitcoin has been designed to avoid regulatory oversight and by its very nature removes the need for counter-party authorities. Covid-19 has been a real test for the global economy and the cracks that appeared during the financial crisis are becoming even bigger, exposing many instabilities," Benz noted.


  According to the expert, the "wonderful thing" about technology like Bitcoin is that whether there is a crash in oil or a global virus it remains consistent with its original design and operates independently without any influence from other markets. "We have seen for the past decade Bitcoin become the best performing asset and this trend will only continue," he said.

Given the rapid decline in oil prices that occurred recently, March and April have been an extraordinary period for rack-to-retail margins, which is indicative of the fuel margin that our variable margin business captures. Rack-to-retail margins have come in, in the recent weeks, but still remain quite strong. We would expect the margins to normalize over time, but the rate at which they do is dependent upon a number of factors from the movement of oil prices, overall demand and site-specific competitive factors that, given the current environment, are even harder to predict than normal. The strength of our variable rate margins has significantly offset, but not completely mitigated the gross profit impact of the loss of gallons we have experienced to date.

Additional (vague) synopses hint at other obstacles to overcome, including uncovering the truth about grown-up Hope's mysterious past, easing dissent among opposing factions within Sanctum, and investigating a few troubling disappearances.

However, there is some room for optimism that the declines in future quarters will be less, although at this time we do not know how this will play out. We can't tell exactly what the depth of the decline in revenues will be or how revenue trends will impact our mix, but as a rule of thumb and given our diversified business mix and decisive cost actions, we would expect the EBITDA decline in 2020, as a percent of our fee revenue decline, to be in the mid-20% range.

(CNN) - Iowa voters are poised to render the first verdict of the presidential race."I have never been not willing to take a chance. I think this election we maybe need to take a chance."Pat Mundy, a retired teacher, has been busy sizing up the field, electing to go with Pete Buttigieg after considering several of the candidates."I started first with Elizabeth Warren. I was very pro-Elizabeth in the beginning," Mundy said. "My next candidate was Pete. I heard him speak twice. Joe Biden, he is a source of comfort. Bernie Sanders comes off much more compelling in person than he does on the screen."A year of listening to candidates at town hall meetings and through TV ads gave voters plenty to think about before making up their minds.Iowa voter Jon Heitland said his No. 1 issue is someone who can beat President Donald Trump."This is the year to play it safe and go with a proven candidate. I think that's Joe Biden," Heitland said.The signs of the season are everywhere in Iowa, from storefronts to front yards. Many voters have been slow to make their choice as they search for the strongest candidate to challenge Trump.Their decisions are driven by issues but above all electability. On that front, Democrats are torn whether to choose a progressive path.Denise Diaz said she's decided on Bernie Sanders."I just love his message. I think he has integrity," she said.But the question of who's everyone's second choice also is critical.Candidates must win at least 15 percent support in the first round of voting. If they don't, voters turn to their plan B.For Hope Bossard, that's Biden. She respects him and is comfortable with him, but after seeing him up close, she wasn't electrified."I have to weigh this out. I like a lot of the new ideas that Tom Steyer has, but I'm good with Biden. If he's our guy I can support him," she said.Cheri Scheib saw Biden and Buttigieg on the same day before Christmas and was unsure who she favored. This week, she said she had come to a decision."I'm going to be with Pete. I am. Mayor Pete got my vote," she said. "As many times as I've seen him, I've enjoyed him every time. I appreciate everything he says. Smart guy. Today really solidified my thought process. I'm going with Pete."Copyright 2020 CNN. All rights reserved.

Man arrested with stolen gun                                                    SALINA -- A MAN was arrested Wednesday after authorities determined he was a convicted felon in possession of a stolen gun.                                                    Salina Police said Wednesday an officer was sent to Wilson Security Solutions, 527 S. Broadway Blvd., for a man, Kristoffer Augustine, 29, of Salina, in possession of a handgun. Augustine was seeking assistance with the weapon malfunctioning and the store called police because of his behavior.                                                    According to police, Augustine left the store before the officer arrived, but it was discovered that Augustine is a convicted felon who was not to be in possession of a firearm.                                                    An officer located Augustine walking in the 1500 block of East Crawford Street. He was in possession of the gun, a Taurus PT111 9 mm. A methamphetamine pipe was also found on Augustine.                                                    Police said the weapon was registered to a 34-year-old Salina man who lives in the 700 block of North Front Street. Police made contact with the man, who said the gun was stolen sometime between 11 p.m. Tuesday and 12:05 a.m. Wednesday. The man suspected Augustine stole the gun, which was lying on a desk in the man's living room.                                                    Augustine was arrested in connection to criminal possession of a firearm, possession of a firearm while under the influence, possession of methamphetamine, possession of drug paraphernalia and theft of a firearm.

BOSTON - There are many possibilities for how lawmakers might tackle next year's budget, Senate President Karen Spilka said, but the pandemic's shocks to state revenues may mean the idea of passing one-month budgets while a full spending plan is developed would need to look different than it has in the past.


  The economic turmoil created by the COVID-19 crisis began as Beacon Hill's budget season approached - typically, the House passes its budget in April and the Senate in May. The final budget is due by July 1, the first day of the new fiscal year, though lawmakers have often negotiated beyond that deadline and passed "one-twelfth" budgets that allocate enough money for a month of operations, based on the previous year's spending.

  With the normal timeline thrown off course and the pandemic's full economic impact not yet quantified, it's still unclear when the Legislature will take up the fiscal 2021 budget or what its bottom line will be.


    Jobless rate spikes to 14.7%; highest since Great Depression  


  The set of emergency rules the House adopted this week gave the House Ways and Means Committee until July 1 to report out its version of the budget, and S&P Global Ratings said in a recent bulletin that it expects Massachusetts to adopt a fiscal 2021 budget this summer.


  "We need to have some budget in some form by July 1, and there's a lot of different possibilities," Spilka told the News Service.


  "We could do short-term and longer-term. We could break it up," she said. "Generally in the past, when we have done a one-twelfth budget for the month of July in the next year, we use the prior year's budget, which I do not believe we can do because the 2020 budget revenue will be bigger than the 2021. Hopefully, we can work very closely with the House and the administration and be on the same page and just really roll up our sleeves and get something done for the commonwealth."


  Tax collections last month fell by more than $2.3 billion compared to April 2019, partially driven by state officials' decision in late March to push the April 15 income tax filing deadline back three months. Economic experts who testified at a recent hearing projected that next year's tax collections could land $4 billion to $6 billion below initial estimates.


  The lack of clarity around a state budget plan creates uncertainty for anyone who relies on spending in the more than $43 billion budget and means local aid levels, a major source of revenue for municipal government, remain unknown for the municipal officials who usually craft their city and town budgets in the spring.


  Spilka, who in the past has served as chairwoman of the Senate Ways and Means Committee and as an Ashland School Committee member, said she spoke to the Natick and Ashland school committees and select boards in her district this week. She said she's "been very honest with them in saying that it may not be pretty, but this is the situation we're in" and sharing economic projections.


    Natick School Committee faces tough choices in wake of coronavirus  


  "I have shared with them that, especially coming from a municipal school committee background, I understand that cities and towns need to plan their budget, they need to set their tax rates, they need something definite at some point in the near future, and we are sensitive to that," she said. "The Ways and Means chairs and secretary of (Administration and Finance) are working on this."


  Last month, the Legislature passed and Gov. Charlie Baker signed a bill that eases some of the deadlines and scheduling requirements municipalities face and allows cities and towns to tap into their free cash, or remaining fiscal 2020 reserves, for fiscal 2021 budgets without having to go through the usual state approval process.


  The Senate on Monday passed another bill intended to give municipal governments added flexibility, and Spilka said it primarily addresses town meetings and vendor services.

Sure. Well, Vik, it's a great question, and it's a bit of a complex answer. Let me first begin by saying that our priorities for the Company have not changed. And we have been very focused, as you know, on continuing to build out, first, our recurring revenue business lines of just property management, facilities management, and certainly if a high-quality property management business came to market today, or in six months, or in a year, we'd be very interested in that business regardless of market cycle. But, then, there are opportunities that are generational. I remember when I was running another firm in this industry back in the GFC, we got through the GFC and put a lot of work into that, and shortly after we began coming out of the GFC a generational opportunity arose, which was the Dutch government asking ING to dispose of their real estate investment management business, which managed $65 billion of AUM. We did not expect to see that coming ever, yet it was an opportunity that was very attractive to us, and it transformed the asset management business at that other firm. So, it's impossible to say what will come from this downturn, if anything. The longer the downturn lasts, the more opportunities will come from distress. If it's a fairly short downturn, maybe very few. Certainly, the distress would come from those usual places. Businesses in our industry that are only Capital markets businesses are going to get hammered, and those businesses we don't know what Capital markets revenues are going to do, but certainly, at least for a short period of time, they could be very, very low, so we're watching those. Businesses that don't have a lot of recurring revenue, so brokerage companies that are in the marketplace, they're going to feel the pain much, much worse than the big three firms will. We'll be watching those firms carefully. But, the primary priorities for the company haven't changed. We love the recurring revenue businesses. We would be interested in asset management if something particularly attractive came at great pricing, probably won't, but you never know, and then if there's real distress in the marketplace and we can buy very cheaply some folks that are on the ropes, we would look at those, probably, across all of our business lines.

As Victorians wait to find out what freedoms will return after the weekend, Premier Daniel Andrews has been careful to say the coronavirus pandemic is not done.


  "Let's not give everything back, let's not throw away all the progress we have made by letting our frustration get the better of us," Mr Andrews said Friday.


  He will announce changes on Monday - the day the state of emergency lifts - but warned social distancing rules would remain at the end of May.


  He is considering the national "menu" of changes available after Prime Minister Scott Morrison unveiled a three-step plan to reopen Australian society and the economy.


  Under stage one of the plan agreed by national cabinet, cafes, restaurants and shops are permitted to reopen, with public gatherings of up to 10 people allowed.


  Victoria's coronavirus tally is 1467 but only 117 are active cases.


  Of 13 latest recorded cases, eight came from the Cedar Meats facility, raising the number of cases in the cluster to 71.

Lusaka, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 8th May, 2020 ) :Zambia's President Edgar Lungu on Friday relaxed confinement measures against coronavirus and allowed certain businesses to reopen after the shutdown caused a drop in revenue.             The southern African country went into partial lockdown on March 20, shuttering borders and businesses and banning public gathering to stem the spread of the virus.             "We have experienced reduced revenue and if the status quo remains the same, our economy will plunge into the worst crisis," Lungu announced in a televised address to the nation.             "I have therefore seen it inevitable to reopen cinemas, restaurants and gymnasiums," Lundu said, adding the hotels and lodges could also consider "getting back to normal operations".

Fred Meyer spokesman Jeffrey Temple confirmed that the chain will also end its bonus pay program on May 16.            In a private bulletin to staffers May 1, accessible only by an employee password, Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen thanked workers for playing a critical role during a challenging time and said he is beginning to see “a slow return to normal in many areas of our business and in businesses across the country.’’ McMullen said the hero bonus through May 16 "is expected to be the final extension.’’            McMullen further told employees: “As consumer behavior stabilizes and our latest safety measures are implemented, we can begin to consider which practices will continue in the future. Some habits, including wearing a mask and physical distancing, likely will continue for some time while others will be phased out.’’            He did not go into detail about what the phasing out might entail.            In response to Kroger’s announcement, grocery workers' unions are calling on the public to support employees in California, Colorado, Oregon, Washington and Wyoming by asking Kroger to maintain the extra $2 an hour in pay. They also want the public to join them in pressuring the company to improve store safety practices and provide testing to all employees as COVID-19 continues to impact local communities.

Let's turn to slide 11 on our media business. Total revenue was up 0.9% in the quarter. This was as a result of 5.6% year-over-year increase in subscriber revenue, driven by Crave growth over the past year and contract renewals with Canadian TV distributors. Not surprisingly, advertising revenue was down 2.5% year-over-year, affected by the industrywide decline in ad sales because of COVID-19. Advertising is frequently one of the first discretionary expense items that many companies cut back on. Although the reduction in spending was relatively small this quarter, that should accelerate in Q2 as advertisers rationalize, delay or eliminate advertising budgets in light of COVID-related impacts on their business.

In terms of the System Fund, I wouldn't actually relate that to what happened in '08, '09 as a real read-across, so, and back then, yes, of course we did reduce, but you're looking at a different environment now. And but what I can say is that, we're acting very quickly and we have managed to scale back the expenditure and System Fund very significantly. It's something that we do want to continue to sustain, because it's the right thing to do, and will drive business and certainly if we were looking into a tough environment in 2021, for example, I wouldn't expect that the System Fund would be cash consumptive.                                                         *[FT]: Financial Times

Great. Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for your patience since we were getting the call up and running. I gather there is quite a lot of call volume at the moment. Anyhow, once again, good afternoon and thanks for joining us. It's a pleasure to be here to provide an update on our progress during the first quarter of 2020. I'll begin today's call with a brief overview of our business operations against the backdrop of COVID-19, and then we'll review first quarter highlights across the pipeline. I'll then turn the call over to Carlos, our new CFO, you just heard of from Chris, and Carlos will review our first quarter financial results, then I'll wrap up and then open the call up for questions.

I decided I could work with the cheesesteak approach and reverse engineer a pizza from there. I kept the sauce the same, and because it can be good on cheesesteaks, used the same yellow American (I am a provolone guy when it comes to cheesesteaks, but that's neither here nor there). The peppers being uncooked before going on the pizza had to be fixed, and to make this more cheesesteak friendly, I diced them and cooked them up with some onions. For the meat, I prepared some shaved steak, then tossed the salami in and got it nice and crispy.                                              *[FT]: Financial Times

And it is early in this -- in this environment. So we'll come back, if things change at the half year and we'll talk about that. And we were in business together with owners for 20 years on the contract. So if they are having troubles with that fees then we will consider deferrals as necessary. So we have to keep it under review. Thanks, Monique.                                                         *[FT]: Financial Times
