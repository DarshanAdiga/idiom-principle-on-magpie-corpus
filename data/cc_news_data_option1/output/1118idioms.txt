There is political significance in Sturgeon not wanting to hang around waiting for Boris Johnson. By being pro-active and making announcements first, it shows that she takes the public health crisis seriously, and wants to inform the public as soon as possible. It sends a signal that the Scottish government is managing the crisis. But more importantly, by Sturgeon announcing key measures ahead of Johnston, such as closing schools, she implies that Scotland is one step ahead of Westminster. It’s a clever strategy; if you want to become an independent country then the first stage is to start acting like one. Sturgeon is sending a subtle message to the nation that her government is ahead of the game.

Governments can help stop this process by creating money and injecting it into circulation. After the 2008-2009 economic meltdown, the United States government and governments around the world created trillions of dollars worth of currency out of thin air and injected it into the economy, usually by buying back their own debt, in an effort to stimulate demand and reverse the multiplier effect. Buying back government debt isn’t necessarily the best way to stimulate the economy, however. The money goes mostly to people who are already rich, and they have very little incentive to invest that money when everyone else is losing income.

EL DORADO - The Butler County Commissioner's passed a resolution on Thursday to for a Public Health Emergency Declaration for Butler County for the county.
   
 The resolution passed 4-1, with commissioner Ed Myer dissenting.
   
 While four of the five voted for the approval, not all were completely in agreement. Commissioner Dan Woydziak did it but felt obligated to do so.
   
 "I'll vote for the resolution because we're forced into a corner where we have no choice," Woydziak said.
   
 With the state's decisions of declaring a state of emergency last week and then with Governor Laura Kelly closing the state's school buildings on Tuesday, the board met on Thursday morning to address the pressing need of a declaration for the county.
   
 The declaration comes six days after a Butler County man tested positive for COVID-19 and two days after Sedgwick County declared an emergency. More than 10 counties in Kansas have issued their own declaration of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 With the declaration, the board also unanimously passed closing all county owned and operated buildings to the public, with the exception by appointment.
   
 The declaration is from Monday, March 23 through Friday, April 3. The two weeks according to the board will give the county time to assess the needs of those within the county and determine what are the next steps needed to move forward.
   
 "There will be employees that we have to address that have compromised health," County Administrator Will Johnson said. "We'll have employees that are truly fearful. We have to have compassion for them."
   
 With the declaration, the county also moved to limit events with 50 or more people. There are certain restrictions according to the board that apply to the detention center as well.
   
 "I'm looking for evidence of 50 people or less in the detention facilities," board member Jeff Masterson said. "That function will have to continue."
   
 For county employees, they are eliminating all out-of-state and out-of-county, with the exception of Sedgwick County travel has been canceled.
   
 "We're going to keep everyone home right now," Johnson said.
   
 All future board meetings will be held without the general public in attendance. To comply with the Kansas Open Meetings Act, all meetings will be streamed via the county website.
   
 "They don't have to participate in the meetings," Johnson said. "As long as they can view, we're in line with KOMA."
   
 The discussion of furloughing county employees was approved. However, how those employees will be paid is still being discussed. Johnson stated those who have been furloughed may use vacation or personal time off. However, Woydziak stated the county should pay employees without using their accrued time.
   
 "We're hoping to be better situated through this," Johnson said. "Only time will tell."

Documented by scientists over 90 years ago, acetylated wood was first produced commercially in Japan in 1980. Until recently the technological challenges and high cost of processing the wood made it too expensive for commercial-scale production. While the initial expense remains higher than conventional wood products, users will save money in the long run through lower maintenance costs.
 Acetylated wood is often produced from fast-growing radiata pine sourced from sustainable forests. Through a series of chemical reactions, the treatment process protects the entire piece of wood, as opposed to other methods which only treat the surface and leave chemicals that can leech out. It also permanently “swells” the wood, creating a stable material with superior dimensional stability, which is a measure of its resistance to cycles of stretching and shrinking. These products have strong resistance to rot- producing fungi and are indigestible to insects (such as termites) and micro- organisms.

In 1893, a state law required towns to have an established high school rather than several schools of higher learning being held in private homes. The Town House became Windham’s first official high school with classes being held in the main part of the building. The town clerk/treasurer/secretary had a small office as well where civic duties were performed and where selectmen held meetings once or twice a month. It continued to serve as the town’s high school until a new, more modern high school was built in 1910.

 GENESEO -- In December Governor Cuomo signed a bill that amended Real Property Law Section 291 relating to the notice of sale or transfer of ownership of residential property.
 The Law is amended to require County Clerks or City Registrars where such conveyance of residential real property is recorded and maintained to mail a written notice of such conveyance to the owner of record beginning March 11. It further states that the County Clerks are entitled to charge a reasonable fee to cover the cost of mailing the notice. To keep consistent across the state the New York State Association of County Clerks has recommended that the reasonable fee be $10.00 per conveyance.
 In Livingston County, this fee will apply to all residential deed recordings submitted for recording on or after March 11, 2020 received over the counter, electronically or through the mail (USPS, FedEx, UPS etc.)
 This fee does not apply to commercial transactions.

WINFIELD -- Organizers of the Walnut Valley Festival are proceeding with plans to host the 49th annual gathering of acoustic music lovers from around the world in September.
   
 Staff at Walnut Valley Association, which manages the festival known to many simply as Winfield, are closely following the situation with regard to COVID-19, and the concerns that festival attendees may have at the prospect of attending a large public gathering.
   
 The crisis stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic has been experienced by everyone, and in so many different ways," said Bart Redford, WVA executive director.
   
 "We think first of those who have contracted this virus, and wish them and their family members a speedy recovery. But our thoughts are also with fellow festival organizers, music venues and musicians, many of whom are seeing their livelihoods threatened because of the cancellations required for social distancing. We will continue to monitor the situation and follow the recommendations of the CDC, WHO and local public health officials. The health and safety of our festival-goers, musicians, vendors and staff is our highest priority," Redford said.
   
 "We have been contacted by several concerned festival-goers, asking whether we intend to have a festival this year," said Rex Flottman, WVA media director. "I think people will understand that we must proceed on the hope that we will get through this and a new normal will emerge in which it makes sense for us to hold a music festival.
   
 "Our hope is that, much like what happened in 2001 when our festival took place immediately following the September 11 attacks, Winfield may be a place where people come together to recover and regroup, bound by music and fellowship."

We encourage patients with mild symptoms to stay at home, to decrease the possibility of transmitting the virus to others. Drink fluids to stay hydrated. Manage fever by taking acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Contact your medical provider if the fever is uncontrollable with over the counter medications or if you are having trouble breathing.

The Congress lost Madhya Pradesh within 15 months of assuming power in December 2018. It had ousted the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which, in turn, had ruled the state for 15 years.
 The government, headed by Kamal Nath, had been on a sticky wicket ever since senior leader Jyotiraditya Scindia quit the Congress and joined the BJP. But the problem in the party is more systemic.
 The infighting within the Congress and the indecisiveness on the part of the central leadership added to its woes.
 This is the second government that the Congress lost within a year. In July 2019 soon after the Lok Sabha elections, the Janata Dal (Secular)-Congress coalition government in Karnataka collapsed after the rebels of the two parties resigned from the assembly, bringing down its numbers and paving the way for the return of the BJP rule.
 The Congress rebels followed a similar formula to bring down the Kamal Nath government in Madhya Pradesh.
 But this was not sudden. Scindia had repeatedly flagged his concerns about the state government's failure to implement the party manifesto or pre-poll promises. He had articulated his concerns and aspirations. But Nath and the central leadership of the Congress remained indifferent, prompting Scindia to quit the party.
 The challenge for the Congress is to keep its flock together in other states ruled by it.
 Rajasthan is already witnessing a tussle between chief minister Ashok Gehlot and his deputy and state unit president Sachin Pilot.
 In Chhattisgarh too, chief minister Bhupesh Baghel is at loggerheads with senior leader, state health minister and one of the aspirants for the top post TS Singh Deo. The differences between Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and his former ministerial colleague Navjot Singh Sidhu are out in the open. In Maharashtra, the problem is distinct, for there are deep ideological differences between Congress and its allies, particularly the Shiv Sena.
 The failure on the part of the central leadership to address the dissension in the state units is adding to the Congress woes. Congress leaders have been waiting for an organisational changes since August last year when Sonia Gandhi agreed to assume the party president's post on interim basis after Rahul Gandhi rejected repeated calls to take back his resignation. He had resigned as the Congress president on May 25 last year, taking responsibility for the party's crushing defeat in the Lok Sabha elections. He had then accused the senior leaders of keeping the interests of their children above those of the party.
 The problems are not restricted to party ruled states only. In majority of other states, the party is yet to appoint different committees right from the block to state levels due to major infighting between the leaders as a result of which its functioning has affected severely.

In light of COVID-19, the Wisconsin Conservation Congress and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources are closely following guidelines from the Department of Health Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization.
 DHS recommends canceling or postponing gatherings of 10 people or more to help protect Wisconsinites from the spread of COVID-19, particularly those who are most vulnerable to infection and severe disease.
 As such, the in-person portion of the 72 public meetings known as the Spring Hearings that were to be held in each county on April 13 are canceled. The public will continue to be able to to provide input on the natural resources advisory questions from the DNR, Natural Resources Board and WCC through the online input option.
 The online input option will be provided through a link that will be posted on the Spring Hearing page and will go live at 7 p.m. on April 13. The online version will remain open for three days (72 hours). Results will be posted as soon as they are available.
 Each year, citizens can recommend changes to natural resource issues through the submittal of citizen resolutions.
 Resolutions can either be emailed to SpringHearingInfo@Wisconsin.gov or typed hard copies can be mailed to: Kari Lee-Zimmermann, Conservation Congress Liaison, P.O. Box 7921 WCC/4, Madison WI 53707-7921. All citizen resolutions must be received by close of business on April 6. Resolutions must also meet the requirements identified on the Spring Hearing webpage.
 Those who complete the online input form will be able to see the resolutions that were submitted by individuals indicating they reside in that county.
 "This is an unprecedented time in history and I'm glad that we have the online option so that we can continue to gather input on these important natural resource questions," said Dr. Fredrick Prehn, chair of the Natural Resources Board.
 Information about the Spring Hearing questions can be found on the DNR website (search keywords "Spring Hearings"). The link will go live until 7 p.m. on April 13.
 "The recent implementation of online voting allows the WCC and its delegates the opportunity to vote without having to appear in person. Following the guidelines from state and federal agencies, members will still have the opportunity to let their voices be heard when it comes to conservation issues," said Larry Bonde, chair of the Wisconsin Conservation Congress.
 "We understand the value of the in-person meeting for discussion and sharing of ideas, but our top priority is the health and safety of our citizens," Bonde said. "We look forward to resuming the in-person meetings next year."
 In addition, two of the five WCC seats in each county are up for election.
 County residents have the option to run for a seat on the Conservation Congress and to elect delegates from their county to represent their county views regarding natural resources on the Conservation Congress. Also, individuals can bring forth new conservation issues of a statewide nature to the attention of the Conservation Congress through the citizen resolution process.
 "As far as the delegate elections go, we will be extending the terms of each of the WCC delegates by one year," said Bonde. "If a current delegate no longer wishes to serve, the seat will become vacant and the county chair can appoint someone to fill the remainder of the term."

Odion Ighalo says he could not afford to have a Manchester United player's name on the back of his shirt when he was growing up in Nigeria.
 Boyhood United fan Ighalo, 30, joined the club on loan for the rest of the season from Shanghai Shenhua in January and has already scored four goals in three starts.
 Following the announcement of the deal, Ighalo's agent, Atta Aneke, posted an old photograph of his client wearing the 2005-06 blue United away shirt that Ruud van Nistelrooy, Wayne Rooney, and Cristiano Ronaldo donned in the League Cup-winning season. The shirt was only used for a year in that form since United switched their shirt sponsorship from Vodafone to AIG in 2006. United retained the blue kit in 2006-07 with the AIG logo.
 Andy Cole and Dwight Yorke were Ighalo's idols when he was growing up but the pair left United for Blackburn Rovers in 2001 and 2002. "I had a United jersey but no player name on the back,” he told the United magazine.
 "It was one of the old blue ones but definitely no name on the back. You have to pay to put names on the back and there was no money to pay for that! I just got the United top.

Im Osten löste das eine Euphorie aus, im Westen einen Schock. Denn mit dem Sputnik, dem „Wegbegleiter“ der Erde, begann eine neue Ära, und Moskau hatte sie eingeläutet. Der Wettlauf im All zwischen den damaligen Supermächten Amerika und Sowjetunion hatte begonnen. Schon zwölf Jahre später schickte Amerika die ersten Menschen auf den Mond. Heute ist der Himmel voll. Nach Erhebungen der Union of Concerned Scientists fliegen derzeit mehr als 2200 Satelliten im Weltraum. Davon geht fast die Hälfte auf das Konto der Vereinigten Staaten (1007), gefolgt von China (323) und Russland (164). Und auch ganz neue Player sind auf dem Markt. Lange Zeit war der Weltraum zwar eine staatliche Domäne. Doch schon 1962 hatte Washington die rechtlichen Wege für private Anbieter freigemacht. So wurde im Mai 1965 der erste kommerzielle Telekommunikationssatellit in eine geostationäre Umlaufbahn geschossen: „Early Bird“. Er verstand sich 35.800 Kilometer über dem Äquator auf alle Arten von Übertragungen zwischen sich und der Erde. Er schaffte gleichzeitig 240 Transatlantik-Telefonate oder eine Fernsehsendung.

Now talking of the Court of Arbitration, I have gathered that FAZ didn't pay their half of the CH22,000 arbitration fees as it was not budgeted for. This means that the only way this case can take off is if Kalusha decides to pay the whole amount alone which is basically 379,334.65 Zambian Kwacha cash money just to be heard with no guarantee he will be on the ballot when the final decision of CAS is made. Based on the deadline given, it means Kalusha must have already paid this cash on Monday this week. Adding the legal cost, it is a princely sum of dough to cough by the King himself.

GENESEO -- In December Governor Cuomo signed a bill that amended Real Property Law Section 291 relating to the notice of sale or transfer of ownership of residential property.
 The Law is amended to require County Clerks or City Registrars where such conveyance of residential real property is recorded and maintained to mail a written notice of such conveyance to the owner of record beginning March 11. It further states that the County Clerks are entitled to charge a reasonable fee to cover the cost of mailing the notice. To keep consistent across the state the New York State Association of County Clerks has recommended that the reasonable fee be $10.00 per conveyance.
 In Livingston County, this fee will apply to all residential deed recordings submitted for recording on or after March 11, 2020 received over the counter, electronically or through the mail (USPS, FedEx, UPS etc.)

Two more persons have tested positive for COVID-19 in Ladakh, taking the number of such patients in the Union Territory to 10, a senior government official said on Friday. Commissioner Secretary (Health) Rigzin Samphel said both the latest cases were from Choshot village of Leh, which was already notified as a containment area by the district administration.
 “After the reports of the two patients came positive, they were immediately shifted to an isolation ward in a hospital here by health officials,” Mr. Samphel told reporters here.
 He said the test reports of 55 more patients, including 11 taken on Friday, were sent to a laboratory in Delhi.
 Officials said the condition of all the coronavirus patients in the Union Territory was stable.
 Responding to a question on the government’s decision to shut a bank branch in Leh, Mr. Samphel said it was part of the preventive steps being taken to control the spread of coronavirus.
 “A family member of a health department official (who had tested positive for coronavirus earlier) is working in a local branch of the State Bank of India. Though an earlier sample of the bank employee was found negative, we are sending his fresh sample for testing again as the latest cases are also from the same family,” he said.
 Once the test report came, the bank will reopen, Mr. Samphel said.
 Earlier, a total of eight patients, including an Army jawan, had tested positive for coronavirus in Ladakh, forcing the authorities to impose prohibitory orders under section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), banning the assembly of five or more persons.
 All educational institutions, hotels, restaurants, bars, food courts and community kitchens were closed down in the region till March 31 while a notification against organising conferences, workshops, rallies, gatherings, sit-in-protests, labour gatherings at Balkhang Chowk, Skampari and Indoor- Stadium was issued, the officials said.
 The authorities had also issued an advisory, restricting the entry of international tourists within the territorial jurisdiction of Leh district till April 30 and said if the need arose, similar steps might be initiated regarding domestic tourists as well.
 Entry of labours from other states into Ladakh has also been banned till March 31.
 As regards the concerns regarding non-availability of left-over food for stray dogs due to the closure of restaurants and food courts in both the districts, Samphel said the running campaign for stray dogs by the Animal Husbandry Department would be intensified and dog sanctuaries created.
 Meanwhile, an official spokesperson said the Indian Air Force’s publicity programme and recruitment rally, which were planned in the Union Territory, were postponed till further orders.
 “Fresh dates for the conduct of the Indian Air Force recruitment rally at Leh and the publicity campaign in the Ladakh region will be communicated as and when finalised and approved by the Central Airmen Selection Board (CASB), New Delhi,” he said.

Great time to adopt'
 Area humane societies are also taking steps to limit possible exposure for staff and volunteers.
 For the time being the Humane Society of Cambria County is working on an appointment basis only, Executive Director Jessica Vamos said.
 When the outbreak hit, the humane society was in the middle of processing adoption applications, so the organization is remaining open in order to continue to serve the community.
 Vamos said her staff have seen a bit of a decrease in adoption inquires, but a positive aspect of the situation is that the staff aren't seeing an increase in intake either.
 She advised pet owners to remember to take care of their animals like any other member of the family and said there may be other positives derived from the quarantine.
 "Right now might be a great time to adopt," Vamos said.
 Because of the increased time at home, she said an individual might benefit from adopting a new pet or even fostering – to get the animal out of the center for some time.
 Humane Society of Somerset County manager Nancy Dantzig agreed.
 "I think it's a great time to have time to spend with a new pet," Dantzig said.
 The Somerset humane society closed to the public Wednesday, but is still taking applications for adoption.
 According to a post on its Facebook page, the society is still allowing people to schedule meet-and-greets with pets once applications are approved.
 Dantzig said the public is still continuing to leave donations for the organization and people are still calling to inquire about pets.

The Congress lost Madhya Pradesh within 15 months of assuming power in December 2018. It had ousted the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which, in turn, had ruled the state for 15 years.The government, headed by Kamal Nath, had been on a sticky wicket ever since senior leader Jyotiraditya Scindia quit the Congress and joined the BJP. But the problem in the party is more systemic. The infighting within the Congress and the indecisiveness on the part of the central leadership added to its woes.This is the second government that the Congress lost within a year. In July 2019 soon after the Lok Sabha elections, the Janata Dal (Secular)-Congress coalition government in Karnataka collapsed after the rebels of the two parties resigned from the assembly, bringing down its numbers and paving the way for the return of the BJP rule. The Congress rebels followed a similar formula to bring down the Kamal Nath government in Madhya Pradesh.But this was not sudden. Scindia had repeatedly flagged his concerns about the state government's failure to implement the party manifesto or pre-poll promises. He had articulated his concerns and aspirations. But Nath and the central leadership of the Congress remained indifferent, prompting Scindia to quit the party.The challenge for the Congress is to keep its flock together in other states ruled by it. Rajasthan is already witnessing a tussle between chief minister Ashok Gehlot and his deputy and state unit president Sachin Pilot.In Chhattisgarh too, chief minister Bhupesh Baghel is at loggerheads with senior leader, state health minister and one of the aspirants for the top post TS Singh Deo. The differences between Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and his former ministerial colleague Navjot Singh Sidhu are out in the open. In Maharashtra, the problem is distinct, for there are deep ideological differences between Congress and its allies, particularly the Shiv Sena. The failure on the part of the central leadership to address the dissension in the state units is adding to the Congress woes. Congress leaders have been waiting for an organisational changes since August last year when Sonia Gandhi agreed to assume the party president's post on interim basis after Rahul Gandhi rejected repeated calls to take back his resignation. He had resigned as the Congress president on May 25 last year, taking responsibility for the party's crushing defeat in the Lok Sabha elections. He had then accused the senior leaders of keeping the interests of their children above those of the party.The problems are not restricted to party ruled states only. In majority of other states, the party is yet to appoint different committees right from the block to state levels due to major infighting between the leaders as a result of which its functioning has affected severely.

"We wanted to see if we could transmit an echo from La Grande to Moscow," Walmsley said. "Using Department of Defense technology, we were able to do it. We became integral in the Oregon Board of Medicine, changing things regarding telemedicine."
 There are several types of echocardiograms. Transesophageal echocardiography produces pictures of the heart by going through the throat. A transthoracic echocardiography uses a transducer to scan a person's chest to gather the images. Additional variations can include stress testing, which looks at the heart after exercise.
 Echocardiogram tests are no risk, according to the Mayo Clinic. The stigma of heart problems and concern over the cost of these tests can keep people from coming in for testing, Walmsley said. The out-of-pocket/no insurance cost can be up to $2,000.
 Walmsley said having this access to the level of imaging Grande Ronde does is what will be most helpful in the fight against congestive heart failure.

People will have to adapt to a totally new way of life. It’s like someone has pressed the ‘pause’ button on the remote. Social distancing means that normal routines and ways of life for the young and old alike will be completely interrupted. Children will have to be amused and entertained at home, while the many elderly people who live on their own could feel increasingly isolated. Thankfully, I’ve heard that local businesses are taking the initiative to offer home deliveries of groceries to the elderly or infirm forced to stay indoors. Neighbours are also playing an important role, offering assistance to those less able. On a positive note, we could see our communities pulling together over this crisis and people helping each other in a way not seen since the war.

We know Plan A works. Studies have shown that early case identification and isolation are more effective than travel restrictions and that early action can substantially reduce the spread of the virus. Experience in these countries confirms the research. However, any delay or hesitation in implementing these measures can have irreversible ramifications. It only takes a small number of cases to be imported to a community for an outbreak to become established. Once past a tipping point, Plan A is no longer effective. Plan B, including draconian travel restrictions and strict closures of public spaces, becomes the only alternative to stem the spread.

La idea de este laboratorio va más lejos de convertirse en un mero circuito en beta permanente. Como explica la consejera delegada de Telefónica, María Jesús Almazor, se trata de un entorno real para probar todos los servicios del coche conectado. “Es algo diferencial y muy avanzado con respecto a todo lo que existe en el mundo”, asegura. Tan novedoso que el pavimento desprende ese olor tan característico a alquitrán de recién asfaltado y las naves que lo circundan brillan como obras estrenadas hace pocos días. La novedad no se detiene en lo estético. Las tecnologías que han incorporado, como las redes 5G, acelerarán la investigación e innovación en soluciones vitales para este ecosistema como las llamadas V2X, que conectan al vehículo con el entorno.

Unfortunately for players and Niantic, the buck stops here — with the global spread of the novel coronavirus (n-COVID-19), starting from China and heading into Europe and the United States more recently, there is likely to be lower community interaction between players who continue to play the game. To make matters worse, many events that were planned throughout the month are now being extended or canceled. Which is not to say that Niantic hasn’t responded to the global pandemic: they have made it easier for players to lure and catch Pokemon from the safety of their own homes, relaxed limits on walking distances to receive bonuses (at least for some rewards), and made it easier for more players to interact with each other without having to be physically close.

This season, Fernandinho has demonstrated his versatility at the Etihad.
 Aymeric Laporte, who's integral to Manchester City, suffered a severe injury earlier in the campaign, forcing the Brazilian into Pep Guardiola's plans.
 Fernandinho has since accumulated around 2,000 minutes in the Premier League as a centre-back and unsurprisingly, he appears to be interpreting the role from the perspective of a midfielder.
 The large majority of central defenders opt to play simple, allowing their teammates higher up the field to take risks on the ball.
 However, due to Fernandinho's midfield roots, his on-ball actions don't seem to have changed despite his new deeper role as part of the last line of Guardiola's defence.
 The 34-year-old is doing more with the ball than most of his central defensive peers, and that can be captured using the numbers.

Many people are now working for home and keeping children off school. The busiest places at the moment are supermarkets, as the panic buying continues and shelves lie empty.

FITCHBURG -- Board members of the Art Longsjo Foundation announced Wednesday, March 18 the end of the Longsjo Classic bicycle race, first held in 1960.
 The event served as a memorial to past Fitchburg resident Arthur M. Longsjo Jr., who in 1956 became the first American to compete in both Summer Olympics (cycling) and Winter Olympics (speedskating) in the same year. In 1958, at the height of his career, Longsjo perished in a car crash while driving home after winning the 180-mile-long Quebec-to-Montreal race.
 Most of the event's budget has come from cash sponsorships by local Fitchburg businesses, such as recent title sponsors Rollstone Bank & Trust, and Research Results.
 "There are many worthy causes, civic groups, and events working to enhance quality of life in Fitchburg," said Reese Brown, event director of the Longsjo Foundation. "After 60 years, the Foundation Board made the decision for the Longsjo race to retire, in part so that the finite local dollars required to support the race can flow to other good causes."
 Also cited was the steep nationwide decline in road-style bicycle racing in the last five to 10 years, with countless races shuttering. In 2010, the race had 1,000 entries across all categories. In 2019, that number had dwindled to 262. From 2016-19, entries fell by 38%.
 "Road cycling is in a freefall, and even USA Cycling (the sport's national governing body) projects continued losses of race entries," said Brown.
 "We mark the Longsjo Foundation's decision to end the race not with sadness, but with deep appreciation," said Fitchburg Mayor Stephen DiNatale. "For 60 years, the race brought international-caliber sports to Fitchburg's downtown streets, and vitality to the city. The race may be bowing out, but it will forever be a part of Fitchburg."
 Art Longsjo's legacy endures in the city, both through the Longsjo Middle School and a memorial on the Upper Common.
 In recent years, the Longsjo Classic expanded into a multi-day event that included races in Leominster and Worcester. Estimates are that more than 15,000 different athletes raced Fitchburg in the past 60 years. Competitors included Tour de France winners, Olympic gold medalists -- and hundreds of local kids, who joined in the event's fun races for those under age 12 in recent years.
 The final Longsjo races, in July 2019, were won by the brother-sister duo of Curtis and Emma White of Delanson, New York -- the latter of whom is slated to compete in the Tokyo Olympics.
 The nonprofit Longsjo Foundation will be distributing its remaining funds to Fitchburg charities and civic organizations. A final news release will be issued regarding these donations. Since 1990, more than $100,000 in event proceeds were donated to local charitable causes.

Netflix has decided to cut its bandwidth by 25% in Europe, Reuters reports. This comes as traffic on home broadband surges globally on the back of remote working due to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. The decision came following a call between the European Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton and Netflix CEO Reed Hastings. This reduction will be in place for thirty days, Netflix said. This is a boon for the EU's internet providers, over 12% of whose traffic is consumed by Netflix in the continent. A spokesperson for the commissioner told TechCrunch that he hopes other streaming companies will follow that example. In France, which is one of Netflix's biggest markets in Europe, an official at the Digital Ministry told a newspaper there that he hopes Disney Plus should postpone its release. A Netflix spokesperson said that streaming quality should not be affected too much.
