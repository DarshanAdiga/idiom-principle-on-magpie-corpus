“At the end of the day, golf is a game of integrity and I never try to get away with anything out there,” McIlroy said. “I’d rather be on the wrong end of the rules rather than on the right end because as golfers, that’s just what we believe.”
 JUST CALL IT A 2
 Normally, the fans would’ve gone wild. Normally, it would’ve been an albatross instead of an eagle.
 Nothing is normal this year at Harding Park, but Mark Hubbard isn’t complaining.
 He holed out from 236 yards in a bunker on the ninth hole — the toughest on the course — to eagle a hole that normally plays as a par 5 for the paying public.
 “I’ve never had an albatross before, so I’m just going to go ahead and count it,” said Hubbard, playing in his first major.
 He shot 71 to make the cut on the number.
 He said he heard some applause from the volunteers and scorekeepers on the course, which is not allowing fans because of the COVID pandemic.
 No matter. It was a sweet memory for his first major.
 “I needed it for my round, but it was also one of those things that no matter what happens after this, I’m going to remember that shot for the rest of my life,” he said.
 TOUGH FINISH
 Mike Lorenzo-Vera of France had a chance to join Li Haotong in the lead, a tall order considering he needed a birdie on the tough ninth hole to end his round. With shots into the thick rough, he wound up making a 15-foot putt for bogey. That gave him a 68, leaving him two shots behind.
 American fans might not know enough about the Frenchman, who is No. 82 in the world despite not having won on the European Tour. His only pro win was on the Challenge Tour in 2007, and then his game went sideways.
 Lorenzo-Vera was brutally honest in a brilliant blog for the European Tour's website in February. That included this gem of a tale of how he started to turn his game around.
 “By the end of 2013 I was kind of lost,” he wrote. "I’ll never forget the moment when I realized how lost I was. I was sitting on the couch at home and the golf was on TV. I was watching David Horsey in a European Tour event and he was going well. Now, this is nothing to do with Dave, but I remember saying out loud ‘How can this guy be doing so well? I was beating him and so many others before.’
 “Then my girlfriend looked at me and said, ‘Because he’s better than you.' I said no he’s not and she’s like, ‘Where are you now, you’re on the sofa, nowhere on the Challenge Tour and he’s playing well on the European Tour so he’s better than you, that’s it.’ This was from a girl that doesn’t know anything about golf, and I was like, ‘She’s right.’ So where do we go from there? That was it. I was on the ground, the bottom of the sea, and that was the moment that I decided to push myself to the surface."

Elias Pettersson is learning on the fly that the playoffs are an entirely different beast and for reasons nobody can really properly explain, as an elite player he has to expect to be targeted with all kinds of physical abuse and play through it. He did an outstanding job of that, simply picking himself up without complaint and playing through it. Brock Boeser is learning that the more he goes to the dirty areas, the more success the Canucks are going to have. And Quinn Hughes continues to learn what he was picking up all through a season that could end up with him winning the Calder Trophy. And that is that he has the chops to be a legitimate star in this league, not just a very good defenseman. The Canucks learned in Game 4 that they don’t have to be saved by their goaltending every game. And Green learned what it’s like to see a young group with long faces and a day off and what it takes to prepare them for the next challenge.

The Jets' Adam Gase, a member of the coaching kiddie corps at age 42, has addressed the situation of coaches getting sick.
 “That’s something that we actually started talking about in April," Gase says. "I’ve looked at it as we almost have a depth chart for myself, the coordinator spots. We talked about position coaches, kind of where that would go. So, a depth chart was really created.
 “I think the biggest concern at the time when we first started talking about it was special teams and making sure that we have guys in the meeting room learning what (special teams coach Brant) Boyer’s teaching. And helping out in that aspect because normally you’ve got your two special teams guys and everybody else is worried about their own deal.
 “So, now it’s the whole staff. We all have to be on the same page. Guys have to understand, hey, you don’t know, you might be the next play caller, whether it be offense, defense or special teams, so everybody’s got to prepare like that. And it’s just like the players."
 Fangio doesn't believe age is a major factor — nor should be — in being careful during the pandemic.
 “I don’t think it matters where you are in your coaching career experience- wise," he says. "This is new for everybody. No one has experience in this. I always like to say, ‘The great ones can INA,’ which means improvise and adjust. We want to be a bunch of great ones here and excel at improvising and adjusting. There’s no wiggle room.
 "The protocols are what they are. We’ve got to abide by them and move past it.”

Since January, Lecompton residents Dennis and Donna Steinman have built wagons in Topeka that promise "a wilder kind of experience."
   
 The Steinmans own PlainsCraft, a Kansas-based business building covered, pioneer-style wagons that can be customized to suit the needs of buyers. The wagons are intended for "glamping," or glamorous camping, which allows people to feel more connected to their natural surroundings without giving up the amenities they love.
   
 Dennis Steinman said he has been enthralled with that style of wagon since he was a kid.
   
 "I'm from Kansas, grew up on a farm, always had horses and just kind of always had a thing for the wagons and the pioneers and the guts they had," Dennis said. "When I was a kid my dad built a little covered wagon for us."
   
 He remembers driving that wagon about 20 miles to the county fair with his little sister and a neighbor.
   
 PlainsCraft melds Dennis' passion for wagons with the business backgrounds he and his wife have. Dennis previously owned an electronics manufacturing company and has done real estate and several other gigs over the years. Donna has a background in interior design and has owned her own retail and interior design stores.
   
 "I've been in business all my life with entrepreneurial-type things," Dennis said, "so here we are."
   
 The name PlainsCraft is a nod to the Kansas plains and the craftsmanship evident in each wooden wagon.
   
 "We put a lot of pride in the craftsmanship," Dennis said. "They're well built. They're going to be around a long time."
   
 PlainsCraft wagons, Dennis added, are bigger and heavier than prairie schooner wagons used by travelers in the 1800s -- so while the newer wagons can be hauled short distances, they aren't intended for cross-country travel.
   
 PlainsCraft wagons are around 225 square feet and start at about $27,000 each. They can fluctuate in price depending on the amenities buyers request.
   
 The wagons are assembled in Topeka at a shop behind the Advance Auto Parts store located at 1939 N.W. Topeka Blvd. Dennis and Donna, who are together in charge of business operations and purchasing, have three employees working there to assemble the wagon parts and create the final product, which takes about a week to complete.
   
 The wagon wheels are crafted by an Amish family in Ohio. The metal work is done by North Topeka Fabrication. And the air conditioning units are made by a company based in Wichita.
   
 "Almost all the materials, except for those wheels, are bought in Kansas," Dennis said.
   
 PlainsCraft has been in business for about two years and had been operating out of Lecompton prior to January.
   
 Dennis said the first wagon PlainsCraft built went to a woman in western Kansas, who chose to furnish it herself with antique furniture. But since then, PlainsCraft has sold mostly to resorts, RV parks and event venues looking to create destination experiences.
   
 Donna uses her design skills to coordinate the interior look of each wagon with a buyer's vision. She helps finalize artwork, customize the number of beds and determine layout of furniture.
   
 "Donna does an amazing job," Dennis said. "That's one of the things that sets us apart I think."
   
 The two wagons built most recently are being transported to Zion Weeping Buffalo Resort in Virgin, Utah. Each one is complete with a full bathroom, at least one bed, lamps, chairs and more.
   
 "We did floor layouts to decide what (the buyer) wanted in there," Donna said, "and I found the furniture and all the accessories he wanted."
   
 Dennis said he hopes to grow the business in coming years as the "glamping" market develops.
   
 "The glamping market is expanding rapidly," he said. "It's a really fun market to be in."
   
 Dennis added half the joy of business is seeing the look on people's faces when they step inside a fully furnished PlainsCraft wagon that's deceivingly spacious.
   
 "We start with a wagon, and the sky's the limit really," he said.

Still, signing for a lower score than you made gets you booted from a tournament, and so, Tringale didn't have to bother waiting around to see if he was in for the weekend.

Jack Ross praised Kevin Nisbet’s performance after the Hibernian striker grabbed a hat-trick in a comprehensive 4-1 win over Livingston.
 The former Dunfermline Athletic frontman got his first two goals for his new club before the interval then calmly slotted in a late penalty for his third.
 Having failed to score on his debut against Kilmarnock, Ross was pleased to see Nisbet leave his mark.
 “I’ve been really pleased with how Kevin has settled in,” said the manager. “He’s made a big impression with everybody from the first time he trained with us.
 “People were impressed with how good a player he was. He played well last week for me as well and played a big part in the first goal. But because he didn’t score, some people judge him on that. So to score and then go on to get a hat- trick is brilliant for him.”
 Ross admitted it was a risk to change the team from last week by moving Martin Boyle to a wider role to accommodate Christian Doidge in attack. But with Doidge also getting on the scoresheet the Hibs boss felt vindicated.
 “You do something like that as a manager and it doesn’t work and you get criticised. And it’s the same with in-game changes. Such is the nature of the beast nowadays,” Ross added.
 “But we struggled here last season and Livingston’s record here overall is brilliant. So we looked long and hard at it and picked a team that we felt would deal with them in possession and then let us do what we wanted to do when we had the ball.
 “We wanted to get the ball wide and into the box and to do that you really need two strikers on the park. On another day it might not have worked but today it worked a treat for us.”
 Livingston’s only consolation was a Lyndon Dykes penalty when they were already three down, leaving manager Gary Holt frustrated.
 “We were not good enough, simple as that,” he said. “We have to look at ourselves. I will look at myself and others have to do the same.
 “I take my share of the responsibility. It was my team, my system, and did it work? I’m not sure. So, I will take that on the chin. But, at the end of the day, the players had to do their job and I don’t think too many did that today.”

CANANDAIGUA -- Before you is a plate brimming with a tasty trio of tacos covered with fresh cheese, pickled red onion and organic radishes. On the side is an enole, a Mexican street corn loaded with cheese and chipotle mayo.
 This comes after you've polished off a giant plate of carnitas nachos, the kind where the maker has defied the universal laws of physics -- toppings, and there are lots of them, on every chip.
 Next step, margarita, right? Good guess and almost there, but not quite.
 Rochester-based Neno's Gourmet Mexican Street Food recently began serving tacos, burritos and other favorites at Star Cider, the year-old cidery near the Finger Lakes Community College campus and Constellation Brands-Marvin Sands Performing Arts Center.
 Star Cider, while now serving Neno's food, has zero plans of giving up on its locally made cider anytime soon.
 So you have the Ciderita, frozen or on the rocks and made with Star Cider's Five Point Cider, which is a blend of five varieties of apples. And it's been quite popular, said Cortni Stahl, who with her husband, Adam, and brother-in- law Nathan Stahl, owns the cidery.
 "It's just super refreshing frozen on these hot days, but it pairs awesome with Mexican food," Stahl said.
 And this is a pairing that makes perfect sense in more ways than one.
 People talk all the time about tequila-based margaritas and tacos, and beer and tacos go great together, according to Fidelio Rita, owner of Neno's. But cider and tacos?
 "It's the best idea in the area," Rita said. "And it's local too."
 Neno's, which got its start as a food cart and food truck and grew to the point where Rita opened a sit-down restaurant on Monroe Avenue in Rochester two years ago, catered Stahl's sister's wedding.
 Everyone loved it, Stahl said, and her brother-in-law approached Rita about doing something together.
 Rita and his sister, who is a partner in the business, mulled it over a while and the answer came in the form of a question -- why not?
 "It was a great idea," Rita said.
 As with most anything today, the coronavirus pandemic temporarily delayed the collaboration from coming to fruition until two weeks ago. And Rita also has had to overcome issues of his own arising from the pandemic and a devastating fire in May.
 But with Gov. Andrew Cuomo's new pandemic-influenced rule forcing bars and restaurants to serve food with alcoholic beverages, the timing was just right.
 Star Cider has ample indoor and outdoor space for socially distanced seating and dining and the experience is more intimate, Stahl said.
 "Guests are able to be more educated on the ciders and the pairings," Stahl said. "It's a different feel and experience, but it definitely worked out for the best. Overall, I think it's a better guest experience."
 Besides forcing a revision of the Star business model -- the cidery previously offered snack foods such as salty bread and soft pretzels as companions to its ciders -- the pandemic also allowed for more time to come up with new flavors, which Stahl, who is a technician in the wine lab at Cornell AgriTech in Geneva, loves.
 "That's my favorite. I love to use different, new local ingredients and try new flavors," Stahl said. "Especially when we were to-go only, people wanted a new flavor every week or so. That was kind of fun."
 Star now offers new summery cider products -- a blue whale seltzer, a seltzer based on its rose cider and a frozen version of the latter, the Frose.
 "The community has been amazing and customers have been awesome. People are excited about cider," Stahl said. "It's exciting to be able to share it face to face."
 Like the Mexican food and apple-based drinks, this business pairing also is working.
 "They have amazing food and they're very talented," Stahl said. "It goes really well together."
