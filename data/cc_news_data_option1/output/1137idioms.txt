In the past, the left has struggled to bring mainstream Democrats on board with Medicare for All, says Sean McElwee, co-founder of the progressive think tank Data for Progress. "At the end of the day there ended up just being a large enough share of the Democratic electorate that really did not feel like they had been brought into Bernie Sanders' movement," he says. To succeed, he adds, progressives must cast a wide net, inviting those who disagree with Sanders on certain policies, but agree on the principles, into the the fold.

We realize that in the current circumstances forced upon him by COVID-19, Trudeau faces many tough choices, where there is no perfect choice, and that any decision he makes will not satisfy everyone.
 But none of this means the prime minister is above criticism.
 That what happens in dictatorships like China, where the COVID-19 outbreak began, not in democracies like Canada, where criticizing the government of the day is a fundamental, constitutional right.
 We believe the prime minister did not respond quickly enough to closing Canada's borders to air travel and the U.S.-Canada border to anything but vital commercial traffic.
 We believe he waited far too long -- years -- before finally shutting down the illegal Roxham Rd. entry point from the U.S. into Quebec, late last week.
 That's where more than 50,000 irregular asylum seekers have entered our country, spurred on in part by Trudeau's ill-advised, anti-Trump, virtue- signalling, tweet on Jan. 28, 2017 that:
 "To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada."
 The fact Trudeau has finally, for now, closed this illegal entry point into Canada is in large part due to long-standing, legitimate pressure from Conservative MPs.
 That's what the official opposition is supposed to do -- criticize the government when its members believe the government is wrong -- and offer an alternative instead.
 The Conservatives have now been vindicated, along with several Sun Media columnists, who were unjustly portrayed as racists by Liberal apologists for urging Trudeau to do what he has finally done -- close down Roxham Rd. -- as a public health and safety measure, in light of COVID-19.
 The prime minister can also be criticized for failing to keep his 2015 election commitment that Canada would have a $1 billion surplus under his leadership this year.
 What we have instead is a $26.6 billion deficit, meaning we'll have to go far deeper into debt to pay for the necessary income-replacement and stimulus package the Trudeau government announced last week.

Next week, Be A Hero and National Nurses United are planning a substantial digital and television ad buy targeted to general election swing states and places with competitive Senate races this fall. Rather than promoting a single candidate, the ads will focus on individual people's health care stories, in an effort to underscore the need to overhaul the country's health care system, especially in light of the COVID-19 crisis.

Liz Jaff, the president of Be A Hero, says that Barkan's group plans to explicitly reach out to Democrats who supported more moderate candidates, but who may favor Medicare for All. Republicans and moderates have pushed the message that "this is only tied to Bernie Sanders," she says, "and so if you don't like Bernie Sanders, you can't like Medicare for All." But in light of the Be A Hero poll, which found that 75% of all Democratic and Independent voters favored the policy, the group is casting a wide net.

I have wanted to share this for so long. A little over ten years ago...at 21 weeks pregnant I was called into the Dr's office at St. Anthony's Hospital in Warwick NY. Being a Catholic Hospital the Dr.'s office was also the old priests office. This day changed my life forever. I remember the large wooden desk the Dr. sat at and the Stained Glass that towered behind him . It was a cloudy day but the soft light danced through the windows and into my eyes. Grady's tiny feet where kicking my belly as my husband grabbed my hand so we could sit down. His first words after we sat down ... "I'm sorry your son has down syndrome, you have two weeks to make a decision...." The only decision we made was to NEVER go back to that Dr's office or deliver there. I have relived those words and that moment over and over again in my mind, they burned deep into my motherly soul. It was THAT very moment my son was named a "decision" and "broken" to the world was also the same day we named him a gift from God. Today is Grady's Tenth Birthday... to celebrate this milestone of Joy I photographed him next to stained glass to bring full circle our story... and to EVERY MARKER that they see on an ultrasound or (after a child is born) that points to Down Syndrome or what the world calls Broken, we filled in with Gold. "Golden Joinery" like the ancient Japanese art of Kintsugi.... an art that celebrates brokenn artifacts by filling the cracks with Gold to bring it to new life.... "Kintsugi often makes the repaired piece even more beautiful than the original" Oh my Grady NO prenatal test could predict that you are filled with a heart of GOLD, you are JOY and LOVE rolled into the most perfect child. Your challenges never ever outweigh your joy. You were sent here to help other's fill in their broken pieces with drops of your gold made by the Creator himself. I love you my boy. Happy 10th Birthday. Love your mom, erin
