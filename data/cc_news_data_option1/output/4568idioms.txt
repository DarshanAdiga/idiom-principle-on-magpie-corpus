LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - It turns out preventing Covid-19 is a bigger deal for markets and the global economy than the drawn-out election of a new U.S. president. News that a vaccine in the works from Pfizer and BioNTech may be over 90% effective gave stocks and government bond yields an injection of adrenalin on Monday. The prospect of a return to normality is a potent market stimulant.                                                           *[FT]: Financial Times

"Now that the election has been independently called for Joe Biden, we look forward to the GSA Administrator quickly ascertaining Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as the President-elect and Vice President-elect," Psaki tweeted Sunday afternoon.
 Psaki added, "America's national security and economic interests depend on the federal government signaling clearly and swiftly that the United States government will respect the will of the American people and engage in a smooth and peaceful transfer of power."
 Additionally, the nonpartisan Center for Presidential Transition's advisory board issued a statement Sunday evening, also calling on the Trump administration to "immediately" ascertain.
 "Now the real challenge begins. We urge the Trump administration to immediately begin the post-election transition process and the Biden team to take full advantage of the resources available under the Presidential Transition Act," the board said in a statement, which was signed by Bush administration chief of staff Josh Bolten, Bush administration Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt, Clinton chief of staff Mack McLarty and Obama Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker.
 In the meantime, there are informal ways to continue the transition process, said Clay Johnson III, who ran George W. Bush's transition in 2000 at a time when the election's outcome was delayed by more than a month over the disputed results in Florida.
 "(Dick) Cheney said, 'We can't wait to see who wins this thing, we have to assume we win it. Full speed ahead,' " Johnson recalled, adding that the Bush transition team was unsure if they would get government support and resources and when it would come. Instead, they raised private money and rented their own office space.
 "Money to support a privately funded transition is easy to raise. (The Biden team) can raise millions of dollars in half a day," Johnson said.
 Bush's team was not legally allowed to formally offer any positions or conduct background checks, so they instead held informal interviews and informal background checks, asking candidates to divulge any possible red flags in their records.
 Trump has made no public indication that he plans to concede or recognize the legitimacy of Biden's victory, and CNN has reported that his campaign is planning a messaging blitz to fuel its argument -- unsupported by any evidence to date -- that the President's second term is being stolen from him through corrupt vote counts in battleground states.
 CNN's Kristen Holmes contributed to this report.

At least three commissioners within the Consolidated Commission on Utilities do not see themselves supporting any pay raises for Guam Power Authority and Guam Waterworks Authority managers, should they be brought up following evaluations for seven CCU employees in a meeting today.                                     Commissioner Simon Sanchez had already stated that he believed it was a bad time to expect pay raises, referring to economic challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has seen tens of thousands of residents lose their jobs or get pay cuts.                                      Newly re-elected Commissioner Judith Guthertz and current Commissioner Mike Limtiaco shared similar sentiments, although Limtiaco leaned more toward the finances of the utilities as his reason.                                      "I'm going to do my evaluations properly, but I'm not inclined to support any increase at this time," Guthertz said. "The timing is not right. I understand the employees probably deserve it, otherwise they wouldn't get a good evaluation. But in this environment ... I'd like to wait until we get through this COVID virus issue."                                     Limtiaco said the pandemic has had a huge adverse impact on the island's economy, ratepayers' jobs and their ability to pay utility bills.                                     "This has impacted the finances of both GPA and GWA. I will base my decision on the current financials and near term financials. Based on the impacts of the pandemic and current financial outlook, I do not foresee approving pay raises," he added.                                     Chairman Joey Duenas, who also recently won re-election, said he has no preconceived notions on pay raises and will wait until he is able to perform the evaluations.                                     But while he understands the concerns in the community and that people are hurting, Duenas said pay is not a matter of public opinion.                                     "Pay is not determined by what people in the community think. It depends on the value that that person brings to the job, in providing that service that the public needs," Duenas said.                                    "In (the Guam Waterworks Authority and Guam Power Authority) they're essential. They come before the police department. I know that sounds arrogant, that sounds like you're stupid - no. If you don't have power and water, you don't even have an economy. So that's what I think of pay. It should be based on what that person brings to the job to do that job," he added.                                    As Duenas said before, pay raises are not guaranteed even with positive job evaluations. It will depend on the will of the CCU.                                     Francis Santos, another commissioner, had not shared his thoughts on pay raises as of press time.                                     The evaluations will include the general managers of the power and water utilities and their respective lawyers and chief financial officers, as well as the board secretary.                                     It will be the first time the CCU will conduct evaluations since the pay-raise controversy in mid-2019, in which the commission was found in violation of the Open Government Law for discussing pay raises behind closed doors.                                                         *[FT]: Financial Times

So, that’s the background, but really relevant to the effect I was talking about is that what the publishers chose to push and what the public would have bought kept getting further and further apart. Because the publishers had excluded the possibility of accidental bestsellers, what they were left with was a stable, continuously spiraling down the drain. For instance, midlist print runs in the '70s were around 70,000 paperbacks, while five years ago they were about 5,000. Publishers had all sorts of excuses for this—“TV,” “movies,” and “games”—despite the fact that two of those were already in existence in the '70s.                                                      *[FT]: Financial Times

Nathan Bain provided one of college basketball’s signature moments last season. His buzzer-beating layup in overtime gave unheralded Stephen F. Austin a stunning upset over Duke on Nov. 26. 2019. Duke was the No. 1 team in the country at the time and hadn’t lost a nonconference game on its home floor in nearly 20 years. But that became just a sliver of the story that night. Bain's layup won a game — and rebuilt a home, rebuilt a school and rebuilt a church, all of it directly impacting the lives of hundreds of Bahamians whose lives were upended by Hurricane Dorian.

The premiere, directed by "Girls'" Lena Dunham, nicely sets the tone of this series, which was created by Mickey Down and Konrad Kay. The producers have also done an exceptional job in casting the new faces -- which include Myha'la Herrold as Harper, an American hiding some secrets, and Marisa Abela as Yasmin, who struggles to earn respect from her male superiors, while beginning a coy flirtation with fellow rookie Robert (Harry Lawtey). Ken Leung, as Harper's mentor, and Sarah Parish as a demanding client are among the more familiar co-stars.
 "Industry" doesn't break a lot of new ground, but the series captures how the entrenched practices of an enterprise like Pierpoint -- and its win-at-all- costs culture -- aren't easily eradicated by diverse talent pools and human- resources departments. The show also depicts the toll that exacts, starting with Hari (Nabhaan Rizwan), who sees working around the clock as the only way to keep pace.
 While "Industry" doesn't posse the artillery of many high-profile premium dramas, it shines primarily based on sharp execution. In that sense, like its hungry characters, it's the sort of overachiever that appears to have a bright future.
  _"Industry" premieres Nov. 9 at 10 p.m. on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of WarnerMedia._

“You cannot substitute the amount of motivation racers get when trying to catch the person in front of you or trying to widen the gap between those behind," Guam Triathlon Federation board member Karly O’Neal said. “It’s very hard to get that same motivation when racing by yourself and just looking at your watch.”                            Recognizing that motivation is key to performing well, Art Guerreo plans to race with four others in an effort to recreate the fire and fuel of competition.                            “We are all going to treat the virtual event as a real race,” said Guerrero, adding this will be his first virtual race since he started competing in 1987.                            Avid triathlete Cameron O’Neal, who has represented Guam in competition and is a Six-Star finisher, recently completed the Boston Marathon virtually. For the virtual triathlon, he said, one of the more difficult aspects is going to be choosing your route.                            “Without traffic control and volunteers, you have to fend for yourself out there on a virtual event. It presents a fun challenge,” he says.                            O’Neal, also a running and triathlon coach, advises younger participants to enjoy it as much as possible.                            “As a virtual event, there are so many variables that come into play that it’s a race against yourself on your course in your weather conditions,” he said. “Completing the event is all part of the fun! It’s a great way to motivate yourself to get the miles in and hopefully, we can be racing on course in real life in 2021!”                            One of the younger participants this year will be 16-year-old Mark Imazu who has goals that go far beyond having fun this year.                                             *[FT]: Financial Times

First off, the Giants already have a shortstop with a big contract on the team. Brandon Crawford's deal, which will pay him roughly $15 million in 2021, expires at the end of the season. The Giants don't need to sweat the small stuff when it comes to the budget, but a $15 million contract is not small stuff. It's reasonable to think that Crawford — who it should be noted had a higher OPS+ than Lindor in the shortened 2020 season and was no slouch with the glove either — would need to be offloaded to bring in a big-money player at the same position.                                                      *[FT]: Financial Times

We at GRREC are excited to continue to be able to help our districts by providing support for the safety of their students, adults and communities.”                                  Costellow, who recently took his current position at GRREC after leading Rich Pond Elementary School as principal, said additional funding for staff training and addressing safety issues will go a long way in making educators, parents and students more at ease at school.                                  “This ensures that schools have a comprehensive plan for addressing emergencies for school safety concerns,” Costellow said.                                                      *[FT]: Financial Times

The newly rebuilt Tabernacle Baptist Church in Freeport, Bahamas, doesn't see as many parishioners as it would in normal times, simply because coronavirus concerns keep a number of them from venturing too far from home. So these days, the church arranges delivery of groceries, care packages, health supplies and more to those in need.                                                                         Strangers made that possible.                                                                         And it all started with a layup.                                                                         Nathan Bain provided one of college basketball's signature moments last season, a buzzer-beating layup in overtime to give unheralded Stephen F. Austin a stunning upset over Duke on Nov. 26. 2019. Duke was the No. 1 team in the country at the time and hadn't lost a nonconference game on its home floor in nearly 20 years.                                                                         But that became just a sliver of the story that night. Bain's layup won a game -- and rebuilt a home, rebuilt a school and rebuilt a church, all of it directly impacting the lives of hundreds of Bahamians.                                                                                                                                   *[FT]: Financial Times

Those are now vanishingly unlikely. Nor is there much to worry about from more onerous regulation – especially since Republicans did little to unravel the post-crisis protections in the first place. And while a President Biden would get to put forward his own people to run financial regulators, those will likely have to pass muster with moderates, even if Democrats manage to get control of the Senate. Financial industry executives may even be on the shortlist, and the revolving door will still revolve.                                                         *[FT]: Financial Times
