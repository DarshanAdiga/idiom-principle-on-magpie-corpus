WASHINGTON (AP) — Joe Biden has won Georgia and its 16 electoral votes, an extraordinary victory for Democrats who pushed to expand their electoral map through the Sun Belt.The win by Biden pads his Electoral College margin of victory over President Donald Trump.&nbsp;Biden was declared the winner of the presidential election on Nov. 7&nbsp;after flipping Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin to the Democrats’ column.Biden now has 306 electoral votes to Trump’s 232.Trump won Georgia by 5 percentage points in 2016 over Democrat Hillary Clinton.In 2020, Democrats had focused heavily on the state, seeing it in play two years after Democrat Stacey Abrams narrowly lost the governor’s race. Both of Georgia’s Senate seats were on the ballot this year, further boosting the state’s political profile as well as spending by outside groups seeking to influence voters.&nbsp;Those two races are headed to a January runoff.Georgia hadn’t voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Bill Clinton in 1992.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

GEORGE COUNTY, Miss. (WLOX) - In George County, schools didn’t escape the wrath of Hurricane Zeta.Every school building in the district sustained some sort of damage, with at least one receiving structural damage when a tree fell on the roofStudents of George County High’s horticulture class spent the morning with tools in hand, working to rebuild one of their greenhouses that was destroyed by Hurricane Zeta.“It’s a little bit disappointing,” said student Aaron Goff. “We worked like two or three weeks just getting the tops pulled in over those and changed out from the last storm, and then that one came in and blew both of them over, and now we got to restart completely. Got to do more work than we did before.”That’s just some of the damage the school district experienced from Zeta.Many of the athletic facilities at the high school will have to be repaired, including the softball dugouts and concession stand.And at George County Middle School, Zeta knocked a tree on to the roof of the building.Now eight classrooms, including the band hall are unusable until the roof can be repaired.Superintendent Wade Whitney said repairs will be costly and could take a while.But despite all the damage, Whitney said they were able to make adjustments and get students back in the classroom quickly following the storm.“We felt like as quick as we could get our students back in our buildings,” said Whitney. “And get our staff back in our buildings, it was the best thing for us, and so again we was able to only miss four school days and we were up and running.”Whitney said he doesn’t expect the damage at the middle school or high school to be repaired before the end of the school year.Copyright 2020 WLOX.

quot;India is a country with close-knit families and friend circles, and hence we believe people will start flying and moving from one place to another to meet their loved ones. Therefore, we believe that leisure travel will see an increase towards the end of this year or early 2021, while corporate travel will take a back seat till the pandemic situation recovers to a larger extent,&quot; the IndiGo spokesperson said.

“Football and its followers deserve better. The current fiasco in reaching an agreement isn’t about the lack of money, but lack of leadership.”
 Knight continued: “We’re putting the current leaders of the Premier League and the EFL on notice.
 “We want to be kept in the loop about every discussion, every meeting, every call, every email, to save clubs at risk. Nothing should be withheld from the committee, and so that fans can see what’s going on, we’ll make these updates public.
 “The predecessor DCMS committee called for legislation to bring in an independent system of football licensing and regulation if the game wasn’t able to reform itself. That time may be fast approaching.”
