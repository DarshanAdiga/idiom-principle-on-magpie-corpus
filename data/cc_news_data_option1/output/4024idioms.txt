The new virtual membership is part of the Tidelands Health Safe in Our Care commitment, which helps area residents safely access the health and wellness services they need amid the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a press release.
 Vanlandingham said initial signups show the virtual class popularity among older people, which can provide challenges for some.
 "They've kind of struggled a little with the virtual and we've been able to talk with them directly and get them signed up," she said. "That initial process is a little difficult sometimes if you're not tech savvy. But it's fairly user friendly once you get signed in if you're not familiar with apps."
 Vanlandingham said there've even been members join from outside the Grand Strand and Hammock Coast areas.
 "We have had some members who aren't planning to visit the area this year, but they've reached out to join us as virtual members, so that's exciting for us," she said. "I think they're very grateful to be able to connect with us and see our faces. The instructors they're used to, the classes they're used to. They're enjoying that."
 Tidelands HealthPoint's virtual fitness classes join Tideland's other virtual programs like the TeleHealth appointments offered by its rehabilitation services team and its parenting classes offered by Tidelands' community team. Personal training is also offered through Webex and FaceTime so patients can have face-to-face time with an exercise physiologist.
 Vanlandingham said she's excited for the future of the program.
 "We're just getting started," she said. "Our plans are to be able to offer virtual fitness challenges and times they can call in and talk to a trainer. And do some healthy cooking classes and letting them connect that way, too. Those are things that we did in the facility and we want to still be able to provide those. We're just going to offer it virtually, as well, now.
 "This may be our future and we don't want this to go away. This wasn't started for it to end when COVID ends. I think there are a lot of opportunities for members that are traveling to be able to take advantage of this virtual membership... they can stay connected with us all year. This gives us a lot of opportunities to have that connection and keep everybody physically active and stay on track with their wellness program."

In response to questions and a request to interview Khalil, his attorney, Michelle Suskauer, said by e-mail: “Mr. Khalil will not be responding to your questions and denies all allegations against him.”
 For Egypt’s ancient Coptic Church, which is usually closed about its inner workings, the allegations and the laicization after sexual abuse claims were unusually public. There followed announcements of changes by some Coptic dioceses to prevent abuse and address claims — as well as questions about the handling of Zakhari’s allegations and debates among some Coptic Christians.
 ___
 The Coptic Church is the main community among Egypt’s Christian minority and has many followers who have emigrated to the United States and elsewhere. Over the years, as other faith communities around the world publicly grappled with clerical sexual abuse, what publicity the Coptic Church received mostly came when it was targeted by militant groups and other extremists.
 “As Copts, we’re not used to discussing such things in public,” said Samuel Tadros, senior fellow at Hudson Institute’s Center for Religious Freedom. If there have been similar cases “they were handled behind closed doors.”
 Online, some criticized the public naming of the priest or expressed fears the scrutiny could be used to unfairly taint the church, especially since Christians are a minority in Egypt.
 Others praised the church for removing Khalil from the priesthood. Still others said leaders responded too slowly and demanded transparency and prompter action on abuse claims.

 Nebraska voters will soon decide whether or not their state approves commercial casino gaming and possibly its first-ever legal sportsbooks.
 Nebraska Initiative 429 would amend the state constitution to allow “games of chance” at licensed racetracks. It’s joined on the ballot by Initiative 430 and 431, which would create a governing body and gaming tax on the newly legal commercial gaming bodies, respectively. All three need majority approval for casino gaming to pass.

When Apple jumps into the 5G market, it's expected to immediately be a huge player. This year, Apple likely will ship 50 million 5G iPhones, according to Strategy Analytics, which would make it the second biggest 5G vendor in 2020 -- and that would be in less than three months of sales. By comparison, Samsung shipped more than 6.7 million Galaxy 5G smartphones last year, after its first 5G phones hit the market in May.
 Next year, Apple is expected to be the world's biggest 5G phone vendor, Strategy Analytics said
 ##  A different iPhone launch
 Apple holding its event over the internet isn't the only thing that sets its iPhone announcement apart from those of previous years. The device is also arriving later in the year than it typically does, with analysts expecting either a late October or early November launch for Apple's newest handsets. That's about a month later than typical iPhone launches, something Apple warned about in July when it acknowledged the new smartphones would arrive "a few weeks" later than normal.
 Apple's announcements will also overlap with Amazon's rescheduled Prime Day shopping event, scheduled for Oct. 13 and 14. Typically, that entirely made-up holiday taken place in July, but this year it was pushed back due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 Apple still held its annual September event, though, using it to announce new iPads, a new Apple Watch and its new Apple One subscription service. The service combines its $5-a-month Apple TV Plus, $10-a-month Apple Music, $10-a-month Apple News Plus and $5-a-month Apple Arcade gaming efforts.

As of Wednesday morning, Ernst had posted 387 portraits on social media. Among them: 77-year-old Gene Kalish, who was drawn in a Detroit Red Wings T-shirt, and Thom and Edith Ecker, who were married for 68 years and died within 10 days of each other. Ernst memorialized 52-year-old Jerry Drake holding his twin children and 35-year-old Carmelo “Pokey” Franchino Castro, who loved to fish, showing off an enormous catch. Each portrait is accompanied by a few sentences about the person’s life.
 “It’s kind of a more lighthearted way to remember victims, rather than just seeing the doom and gloom that this virus has unfortunately brought to this country,” Ernst said.
 Ernst has about 100 pending requests for portraits, which she fulfills in the order she receives them. After Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died on Friday, Ernst took a break from drawing coronavirus victims to commemorate Ginsburg’s life with a similarly styled portrait, swapping out the yellow heart for a purple one, symbolizing pancreatic cancer awareness.
 “She was one of my inspirations,” Ernst said of Ginsburg. “She just stood for everything that I think is right in times like this.”
 Ernst said she remains frustrated by those who continue to dismiss the seriousness of the coronavirus and ignore the guidelines to reduce its spread, but the gratitude and support she has received from the community of people who have lost loved ones to the disease is “beyond anything I could have imagined.”
 Ernst started 10th grade this month and is taking all of her classes virtually. While navigating that challenge, she continues to draw portraits in her free time and has no intention of slowing down.
 “This is definitely something I want to keep doing,” Ernst said. “With the things that are said on the news in regards to second waves, if God forbid there is one, I’m trying to just raise awareness that there are so many lives that can be saved and hopefully that means that there’s less faces I have to draw. As much as I love helping the family members and remembering those lost, I’d rather not do it, because that just means there’s one more person who’s passed away.”

Wary of a potential backlash from ticket aspirants, the Congress delayed the release of its first list of candidates for the upcoming assembly elections in Bihar with Thursday being the last date of filing nominations for the first phase of polling on October 28. The other political parties such as the ruling Janata Dal (United), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) had already declared their candidates for the first phase. A Congress functionary said the party released the names of 21 candidates for the first phase a few hours before the close of the nominations to avoid strong reactions from ticket aspirants. Among the candidates are Shubhanand Mukesh, son of Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Sadhanand Singh, who has decided not to contest this time, from the Kahalgaoon seat and former Bihar Youth Congress president Lallan Yadav from Sultanganj. The party also fielded Akhauri Onkar Nath from Gaya Town instead of Mohan Shrivastava, who is facing alleged charges of rape. Shrivastava's name was earlier cleared but dropped at the last minute following objections raised by a section within the party. The names of two other candidates were also held back on similar grounds. The Congress list included seven Rajputs, four Bhumihars, four Dalits and two Brahmins. There is only one woman candidate in the first list. Seventy one constituencies in 16 districts will go to polls in the first phase. Most of these constituencies fall in Left Wing Extremist affected districts. In the second phase on November 3, polling will be held in 94 constituencies while 78 seats will go to polls in the third and final phase on November 7. Votes will be counted on November 10. The Congress is contesting on 21 seats in the first phase. The names were cleared by the party's central election committee (CEC), headed by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, on Monday. The functionary quoted above said the party candidates on these seats were individually informed about their selection and asked to submit their nomination papers. "This was done to avoid any backlash from the aspirants who have been denied party nomination," he added. He further said the Congress had received 2700 applications on all the 243 seats but eventually had to accommodate only 70 contenders. As per the seat-sharing deal finalised among the 'mahagathbandhan' or Grand Alliance constituents, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) is contesting on 144 seats, the Congress on 70 and the left parties on 29. On Monday, the CEC had discussed 46 names and on October 12, the panel will select the party candidates for the remaining two phases.

 I’ve known people who are not ashamed to declare that nothing will stop them from living exactly the way they want and this might be true, however waiting until you are taking your last breath to admit you are wrong is very risky to say the least.

Dawson Springs teachers started working in their classrooms and planning the curriculum to get everything planned for school in mid-August, said Cavanah. They wanted to plan for every type of learning experience the students could have this year.
 On Monday and Tuesday of this week, the independent school system hosted soft openings to acclimate students back into the classroom and go over the new guidelines everyone must follow amid the pandemic.
 “It was still up in the air on what we would be able to do so I feel like we came up with all the plans we possibly could,” said Cavanah. “Moving toward this hybrid learning plan, we spent a lot of time working on what activities would be best for them to work on at home versus what they are going to be doing in our room.”
 Becky Oliver, a fifth and sixth grade social studies teacher, said they are utilizing more technology this year than in past years with students doing more independent work and less group activities.
 The number of students has reduced per class, with some still doing virtual learning and the other students doing in-person split into groups that come on different days of the week.
 “The advantages is anytime you have smaller classes, you can give more one-on- one. The disadvantage is trying to keep up with where everybody is at because you are presenting on one day and you have to wait and present it on the next day. Repeating makes it a little more difficult,” said Oliver.

The Smithville Seminoles got the monkey off their backs, hanging on in the fourth quarter for a 27-21 Division 2-1A win over Vardaman on Friday night.
 “We made some drastic improvements this week in all phases of the game, offense, defense and special teams,” Smithville coach Chad Collums said. “We had some costly penalties that we have to clean up, but I think if we can take care of the ball and play more disciplined football, we are going to be fine the rest of the year.”
 Smithville took an early 6-0 lead, capping off a drive with a 3-yard touchdown run by Chandler Woodham.
 Vardaman answered just a couple of minutes later, taking a 7-6 lead on Logan Jenkins’ 31-yard run, but Dylan Christian found the end zone with 2:31 to go on a 19-yard run to put the Noles up 13-7 to end the quarter.
 Christian extended the lead with a 9-yard scoring run late in the third quarter to go up 21-7.
 The Rams cut that to a one-score game on Grant Fugue’s 47-yard touchdown reception from Britton Bailey, but Christian and the Noles answered again as he scored on a 20-yard run with just a little over two minutes to go.
 “Dylan (Christian) ran the ball really well last night, around 26-27 times. I’m not sure how many yards he finished with, but he had a really good night, also with an interception on defense,” Collums said. “Chandler (Woodham) had a really good game on both sides of the ball and had some sacks on defense, along with Blake Williams, who also played well defensively. Tyler Lann played really well and ran the ball well. He did everything we wanted him to, and it’s just a matter of getting him game experience because he doesn’t really have any of that since junior high.”
 Vardaman made it interesting with Bailey’s 4-yard keeper with 11 seconds to go, but their onside kick attempt went out of bounds to help ice the win for Smithville.
 Collums said another one of the big improvements came on the offensive line, a position they are finding some depth at.
 “They were stepping where they needed to step and doing what they needed to do,” he said. “We had a lot of guys that stepped in at random times and did really well. We have about eight or nine guys getting playing time on the offensive line.”
 The Noles have their third straight home game this week, hosting West Lowndes in another division showdown.
 “They are a very big, very athletic team,” Collums said. “I was joking with their coach and told him that it looks like they have the exact same thing going that they had when I was here before in 2015 and 2016. They are going to be really good, and we have to bring our A-game. We still have to make improvements and continue to do that, but it’s big to get that first win, so hopefully we can build off that.”

In mid-August, Ernst, who recently got into digital design after sketching, drawing and painting for years, was “messing around” with the Procreate app on her iPad and drew a silhouette of her grandfather in a blue polo shirt and glasses, his white hair parted to the side. Ernst’s mother, Karen, was so impressed with the portrait of her late father that, with Hannah’s consent, she shared it with her online coronavirus support groups and solicited requests for portraits from others who had lost loved ones to the disease.
 The next day, Hannah created a Facebook page and an Instagram account to share her portraits, figuring she might receive five or 10 additional requests.
 “It’s just snowballed,” she said. “Suddenly, we were getting 10, and then 20 requests per day. Eventually, it went national, and then we were getting people from India, Greece, England and all over the place asking for portraits.”
 Ernst says a single portrait, which she draws from a photograph provided by the victim’s loved one, typically takes about 15 minutes. Some portraits, including of people in uniform or holding something, such as a pet or a meaningful object, take a bit longer.

MOSCOW — Compile a list of least-enviable jobs of 2020, and athletic director probably lands somewhere near the top.
 As athletic directors and other administrators try to devise plans that balance safety and student involvement during a pandemic, decisions seem to change daily out of necessity. That’s been no truer than for Moscow High School athletic director Lance Abendroth, who saw sports at his school canceled in the spring and fall, then return in a matter of weeks in September.
 For Abendroth, 49, a day starts before 7 a.m. with what sometimes is hours of phone calls, text messages and emails to everyone from parents, to coaches, to other athletic directors, state directors, health advisors and more. By the afternoon or evening, Abendroth often is headed to a Moscow football game, volleyball match or other event. Then, it’s home by 10 p.m. at the earliest and the whole scenario starts again the next day.
 “There’s a lot of being creative, a lot of patience, a lot of understanding and a lot of communication and teamwork with all types of people,” said Abendroth, whose sixth year as the Bears’ assistant principal/athletic director has been unlike any he’s seen in about three decades working in high school athletics as a coach and administrator.
 It all started in the spring when sports were canceled across the nation because of the coronavirus pandemic. That led to a summer of planning for every scenario imaginable as schools wondered if sports would return in the fall.
 Instead of a summer vacation with road trips and relaxation, it was Zoom calls almost every other day with other administrators in the Inland Empire League.
 “You tried to have a minimum of two to three (plans), but I’ll be honest, those would change about every four or five days because you’d get more information or something else would happen,” Abendroth said. “There would be a new development that would wipe away half if not all of that one plan, so it’s an incredibly tedious learning process as well.”
 In addition to the obvious challenges of coming up with COVID-19 protocols and changing sports schedules on the fly, there’s also dealing with a shortage of officials and bus drivers in the area.
 “It’s affecting everybody in different ways you wouldn’t really think of,” Abendroth said.
 Abendroth said he’s thankful for his fellow administrators, coronavirus- related committee members and experts who have helped in the decision making.
 The challenge lies in trying to be as safe as possible while also giving kids an opportunity to play sports in what for many will be the final chance to do so. It’s tough when even experts sometimes disagree with each other on what is best.
 “I do not want to get into politics or religion but just who do you go by, who do you trust when scientists and doctors don’t even agree?” he said. “And then you’re trying to make the best decision you can, or your group is, and there’s arguments on both sides. And then once you feel like, ‘OK, we’ve kind of got this resolved,’ then it changes again.”
 Abendroth said one of the hardest parts of the job recently has been turning people away from events. A Moscow graduate himself (1989), he knows a lot of people in the small Palouse town.
 Moscow currently allows only four fans per player at sporting events, and masks and social distancing are required.
 “I know a lot of people (here), and that’s one one of the hardest things right now is having to say ‘No,’ ” Abendroth said. “But the bottom line is if we want to continue to give these kids a chance to play, we’ve got to continue to stay safe.”
 Abendroth said it will continue to take everyone working together to make things work.
 “I know everybody is stressed and I know everybody is concerned,” Abendroth said. “I just hope they try to keep things in perspective. Just try a little harder (to show) compassion and understanding towards each other, ’cause everybody is struggling. They might not show it, but everybody is struggling with something. If we can keep that in mind, I think we’re going to be just fine, we’re going to weather the storm and continue giving these kids a good opportunity.”

In addition to his son, he is survived by daughter Monica and wife Carli Nash.
 John Lester Nash Jr., whose father was a chauffeur, grew up singing in church and by age 13 had his own show on Houston television. Within a few years, he had a national following through his appearances on “The Arthur Godfrey Show,” his hit cover of Doris Day’s “A Very Special Love” and a collaboration with peers Paul Anka and George Hamilton IV on the wholesome “The Teen Commandments (of Love).” He also had roles in the films “Take a Giant Step,” in which he starred as a high school student rebelling against how the Civil War is taught, and “Key Witness,” a crime drama starring Dennis Hopper and Jeffrey Hunter.
 His career faded during the first half of the 1960s, but he found a new sound, and renewed success, in the mid-60s after having a rhythm and blues hit with “Let’s Move and Groove Together” and meeting Marley and fellow Wailers Peter Tosh and Bunny Livingston during a visit to Jamaica. Over the next few years their careers would be closely aligned.
 Nash convinced his manager and business partner Danny Sims, with whom he formed JAD Records, to sign up Marley and the Wailers, who recorded “Reggae On Broadway” and dozens of other songs for JAD. Nash brought Marley to London in the early 1970s when Nash was the bigger star internationally and with Marley gave an impromptu concert at a local boys school. Nash’s covers of “Stir It Up” and “Guava Jelly” helped expose Marley’s writing to a general audience. The two also collaborated on the ballad “You Poured Sugar On Me,” which appeared on the “I Can See Clearly Now” album.
 After the 1980s, Nash became a mystery to fans and former colleagues as he stopped recording and performing and rarely spoke to the press or anyone in the music industry. In 1973, he told Crowe that he anticipated years of hard work: “What I want to do is be a part of this business and to express myself and get some kind of acceptance by making people happy.”
 A quarter century later, he explained to The Gleaner during a visit to Jamaica that it was “difficult to develop major music projects” without touring and promoting and that he preferred to be with his family.
 “I think I’ve achieved gratification in terms of the people I’ve had the chance to meet. I never won the Grammy, but I don’t put my faith in things of that nature,” he added. “A lifetime body of work I can be proud of is more important to me. And the special folksy blend to the music I make, that’s what it is all about.”

SALT LAKE CITY - Vice presidential debates typically play second-fiddle to the presidential contests, but President Donald Trump's COVID-19 illness - coupled with his and Democratic nominee Joe Biden's age - will thrust the spotlight on Mike Pence and Kamala Harris.
   
 The 90-minute event Wednesday will allow viewers to assess the understudies for the role of commander-in-chief. And there may be a clearer discussion of the policy differences between the two campaigns than was apparent during the first presidential debate, which quickly descended into chaos with name calling, frequent interruptions and the candidates veering away from subjects asked.
   
 Here's what to watch for in the Pence-Harris match up.
   
 Appearing presidential
   
 Both candidates will do their best to sell themselves as a credible potential replacement for the top of the ticket. That basic threshold for the vice presidential nominee is of heightened importance because Trump's illness - and the pandemic in general -increases the possibility that Trump, 74, or Biden, 77, might not be able to finish a term. Either would be the oldest president sworn into office on inauguration day next year, raising the risk even if COVID-19 goes away.
   
 "I suspect the renewed focus on succession will make the candidates focus even more on demonstrating that they are plausible presidents in the eyes of potentially reachable voters," said vice presidential scholar Joel Goldstein, an emeritus professor of St. Louis University.
   
 In addition, Pence and Harris will have a leg up on other potential presidential candidates in the 2024 election. So both need to do their best to help their running mate win in November while preserving their own chances of competing in four years.
   
 "I'll be curious to see to what extent, if any, (Pence) seems to be laying the groundwork for that possibility," said Republican strategist Michael Steel.
   
 Dominance of COVID-19
   
 Even before the president contracted COVID-19, the coronavirus pandemic was dominating the campaign. Harris will undoubtedly focus on the administration's response to the pandemic - and can specifically criticize Pence as head of the White House's task force.
   
 "He's not really in a position to defend Trump's handling on it because he and his office are a part of the failure," said Goldstein, the vice presidential scholar.
   
 Harris can also question if Pence acted appropriately after the president's diagnosis or whether he should have quarantined to potentially protect others from getting infected if he turned out to be a carrier, as well as to protect the line of succession if Trump's condition worsens.
   
 "When the president told me he was headed back to the White House, he told me to head to Utah," Pence said Monday after Trump tweeted that he would be leaving Walter Reed Hospital.
   
 Pence has gone after Harris for saying she wouldn't trust Trump's assurance on the safety of a COVID-19 vaccine.
   
 "That's an insult to thousands of dedicated scientists and researchers who have been working around the clock to save American lives," Pence said while campaigning in Pennsylvania last month.
   
 Pence going after the 'radical left'
   
 As much as Harris may want to talk about the pandemic, Pence has sought to paint her as part of the "radical left." He's accused Harris of wanting to abolish fossil fuels, banish red meat from Americans' diet and allow "abortion on demand right up to the moment of birth." In keeping with the Trump campaign's heavy emphasis on law and order, Pence has also criticized Harris for saying it's "outdated" and "wrongheaded" to "think the only way you're going to get communities to be safe is to put more police officers on the street."
   
 "What we have to do and what we will do is reimagine public safety," Harris said, before talking about improving communities.
   
 Alan Schroeder, a presidential debate historian and author of the book "Presidential Debates: Risky Business on the Campaign Trail," said Pence will try to portray Harris as an out-of-touch liberal from San Francisco.
   
 "I expect we're going to hear the words `San Francisco' a lot," Schroeder said. ""They're going to try to depict her as sort of a modern day, Angela Davis, or Emma Goldman, or pick your favorite female radical in American history."
   
 Pence is a 'master of the pivot'
   
 Harris used her prosecutorial background to bear down on Attorney General Jeff Sessions during a 2017 hearing on Russian interference in the 2016 election.
   
 "I'm not able to be rushed this fast," Session said at one point. "It makes me nervous."
   
 Schroeder said he doubts that Pence is "going to be quite the shrinking violet that Jeff Sessions was."
   
 "He will have studied, I'm sure, those exchanges and they're going to try to prepare him for that," he said.
   
 For her part, Harris has likely worked on strategies to get the famously disciplined Pence off his talking points.
   
 "He is a master of the pivot," said Robert Barnett, the Washington lawyer who has prepared many Democrats for presidential and vice presidential debates, including portraying Pence in Kaine's 2016 debate prep.
   
 Supreme Court opening
   
 Before Harris questions Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett from her seat on the Judiciary Committee at next week's confirmation hearing, the topic will likely come up during the debate. Democrats have tried to center their opposition to Barrett around her criticism of the court's decision upholding Obamacare, a ruling that will be revisited shortly after the election.
   
 But a Biden campaign aide said Harris won't shy away from arguing that the landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion is in jeopardy if Barrett is confirmed.
   
 "Judge Barrett has a long record of opposing abortion and reproductive rights," Harris said after Barrett's nomination to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg. "There is no other issue that so disrespects and dishonors the work of Justice Ginsburg's life than undoing the seminal decision in the court's history that made it clear a woman has the right to control her own body."
   
 Coming from a woman, Harris' charge could pack a bigger punch. And there's no bigger opponent of abortion than Pence, for whom it has been a top issue throughout his political career, setting up some potential fireworks.
   
 Pence's opposition to abortion is rooted in his deeply held religious beliefs as is Barrett's. Republicans have accused Democrats of anti-religious bigotry in questioning how Barrett's faith might affect her judicial opinions.
   
 Speaking to the Faith and Freedom Coalition last month, Pence accused Harris of having "attacked" a federal judicial nominee in 2018 for being a member of the Catholic Knights of Columbus fraternal organization. Harris had asked the nominee whether he was aware that the fraternal organization "opposed a woman's right to choose."
   
 "These attacks on our freedom of religion must stop," Pence said.
   
 Expanding the Supreme Court
   
 In the first presidential debate, Biden refused to say whether he supports adding justices to the Supreme Court if he wins. That's a move many liberals are calling for but could turn off the more moderate voters - particularly in the suburbs - who are contributing to Biden's polling advantage over Trump.
   
 Harris, herself, stumbled over the question in an MSNBC interview last week. After the Trump-Biden debate, she told CNN that the focus should be on the election now and Biden would "deal with later, later."
   
 She may get pressed again to get the ticket to take a position.
   
 'Religious freedom' issues
   
 Before Pence became vice president, he made national news through a controversial law he signed as Indiana's governor that critics said could be used to discriminate against gays and lesbians. The state law was modeled after the 1993 federal "Religious Freedom Restoration Act," which Harris wants to change. She's introduced "Do No Harm" legislation to amend the law, saying it's been used to discriminate against LGBTQ individuals, women and children in the guise of protecting freedom of religion.
   
 As vice president, Pence has continued to champion "religious freedom," making the subject ripe for contrast. He particularly likes to talk about the Little Sisters of the Poor, one of the religious non-profits which fought against Obamacare's requirement that birth control be included in health insurance offered by non-church employers.
   
 "President Donald Trump ended the assault on the Little Sisters of the Poor," Pence recently said, before accusing Biden of wanting to resume the fight.
   
 Harris is likely to counter that access to health care is a right and employers can't decide such issues for a worker.
   
 Pronouncing Kamala
   
 Trump likes to play around with Harris' first name, which is pronounced "comma-la," like the punctuation mark.
   
 "You know if you pronounce her name wrong, she goes crazy," Trump said at a September rally in Virginia, before mispronouncing it "kah-MAH-la" but adding, "It's like a comma. She's like a comma."
   
 Pence also uses the "kah-MAH-la" pronunciation. If he does it Wednesday, we'll see how Harris reacts.
   
 Audience size
   
 The 2016 vice presidential debate between Pence and Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine attracted 44% fewer viewers than the least-watched of the three presidential debates that year, according to the Pew Research Center. That was the biggest- ever drop-off.
   
 Even without the extra dynamic of Trump's hospitalization, the historic nature of Harris' nomination as the first woman of color on a major party ticket may attract a larger-than-usual audience. So far, the only vice presidential debate that was watched more than any of that year's presidential contests was the 2008 matchup of then-Sen. Biden and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. Nearly 70 million tuned in compared with 37 million in 2016.

Skai Jackson's _Dancing_ _With the Stars_ tribute to late co-star Cameron Boyce was "really special and touching" for the late actor's parents, they said during a new episode of _People (the TV Show!)_. Jackson, 18, dedicated Monday's dance to John Legend's "Ordinary People" to her former _Jessie_ co- star, who tragically died at just 20 in July 2019 after suffering an epileptic seizure in his sleep. Jackson's emotional performance wowed the judges, earning her the first 10 of the season and a total score of 28/30.
 "For Skai to have the opportunity to share her love of Cameron in that way was just really special and touching," Cameron's mother, Libby Boyce said of the dance. "She looked beautiful," Cameron's father, Victor Boyce, chimed in. "I've known her since she was 7 and she's always been talented. And now, as a young woman, she really projected grace, and it was just heartfelt."
 Jackson said during Monday's episode that Cameron had "taught me so much, even little things like being a kind person, being motivated [and] wanting to try harder," telling host Tyra Banks that she hoped the dance would make him proud. "He was someone that was really important to me and he's part of why I did the show," she said tearfully.
 Victor and Libby said that it was good to hear about their son's positive impact as they continue to grieve to loss of their son. "We can have a few days go by that we're holding up, and the next day, we fall into each other and remember the reality, which is extremely raw and painful and will be forever," Libby said. "It's nothing you get better from. It's an everlasting pain, and it's part of our life and the cards we were dealt."

 Jackson also drew attention to the Cameron Boyce Foundation, launched by Victor and Libby after his death to provide "young people artistic and creative outlets as alternatives to violence and negativity and uses resources and philanthropy for positive change in the world" as well as raise awareness about epilepsy. "Epilepsy is what killed our son, and we pretty quickly realized that that had to be at the core of what we are doing," said Libby.
 "Everyday is unreal and surreal," Victor continued. "I just can't describe it to you. Immediately when our son passed, my wife's first thing was his death cannot be in vain. Our goal is to keep his legacy alive and help as many people as we can."

With everything going on in our country these days, now seems the perfect time for something a little more aspirational, like reliving the story of the Mercury Seven, America’s first astronauts.
 But the new Disney+ drama, “The Right Stuff,” doesn’t tell a completely rosy story, as it shares all the warts of the seven men who were racing to become the first in space. And that’s OK, because doing so makes for pretty compelling drama, while still creating the nostalgia for a simpler time I think we all can use right now.
 Based on the novel of the same name by Tom Wolfe, “The Right Stuff” begins in the earliest days of the U.S. Space Program as the newly created NASA works to send a man into space in two years, desperately trying to win the space race with the Soviets. Seven men are chosen to begin the intense training regimen, but two of those men rise to the top pretty quickly — Alan Shepard (Jake McDorman), one of the Navy’s all-time best pilots, and John Glenn (Patrick J. Adams), a squeaky clean, but legendary Marine pilot.
 As the seven become celebrities and set out on a national tour to generate support for NASA, Glenn becomes the group’s front man, thanks to his natural abilities in front of the camera. Shepard only wants to fly and struggles with the public relations aspects of the job. And it doesn’t help that Shepard is a real playboy and not-so-devoted husband. Shepard is not the only one with marital issues as Gordon Cooper (Colin O’Donoghue) must convince his estranged wife to pretend to be happily married in order to achieve this opportunity, all while being followed by reporters. In contrast, Glenn is completely devoted to his children and his wife, Annie (Nora Zehetner), who struggles with a speech impairment. Concerned about the constant interference in their lives, the seven strike an exclusive deal with Life magazine to present a perfect picture of their lives to the public.

ECRU– The Ripley Tigers (2-3, 1-0) built a 21-0 lead early in the first half and never looked back, defeating the North Pontotoc Vikings 35-21 on Friday. The Vikings cut the lead down to a touchdown late in the third quarter, but Ripley scored with two minutes left to secure their first Division 1-4A win.
 Penalties and turnovers doomed the Vikings offensively as North was flagged six times on the night for holding. Reece Kentner threw three interceptions in the first half and five total for the game.
 “You aren’t going to win many games by turning the ball over five times,” said Vikings head coach Andy Crotwell. “I have to do a better job as well making sure we are protecting the football and that we treat it as important as it really is on game days, because without that thing it’s just 22 guys out there butting heads.”
 Ripley led 21-0 with eight minutes left in the second quarter behind two Immanuel Griffin touchdowns and an 8-yard run by LeBron Vance. Kentner scored on a 9-yard run to put the Vikings on the board. Winn Navarrete hauled in a 22-yard touchdown reception from Kentner for North Pontotoc with four seconds left in the first half to cut the Tigers' lead to two scores. Ripley led 28-14 at halftime.
 The Vikings put together their best drive of the game to open the second half, and it resulted in a 23-yard touchdown pass from Kentner to Navarette to make it 28-21 at the end of the third quarter. North Pontotoc (3-2) had three drives in the fourth quarter, and three of them ended with turnovers. Ripley scored on an 11-yard touchdown pass from Ty Long to Diamante Williams to seal the game late and hand the Vikings a tough loss at home.
 “I thought that with the exception of a few coverage breakdowns our defense played better this week,” said coach Crotwell. “Offensively we just kept putting them in a hole, and when your defense is out there for that long you are going to give up touchdowns.”
 Raquan Booth led the Vikings with 108 yards rushing, and Winn Navarette finished with 47 yards receiving and two touchdowns.

 Zakhari was born in Florida to parents who are “faithful servants” in the Coptic Church and the church was at the center of her upbringing, she said.
 In her statement to the Altamonte Springs Police Department in Florida in February 2013, Zakhari said the incident happened in the late 1990s when she was 11 or 12.

 The Altamonte Springs Police Department told AP an investigator discussed Zakhari’s report with the state attorney’s office at the time and it was determined that the statute of limitations had expired.

 # Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger on Titans' COVID-19 cases forcing schedule change: 'We got the short end of the stick'
 Lorenzo Reyes
 USA TODAY
 Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger expressed frustration over a schedule tweak due to the COVID-19 outbreak that has hit the Tennessee Titans.
 After two more Titans players tested positive Wednesday, there have now been at least 20 confirmed infections since last Monday of Tennessee players and staff. The outbreak forced the postponement of the Week 4 scheduled game between the Steelers and the Titans in Nashville.
 The shift moved up the Steelers' bye week, which had originally been scheduled for Week 8. That means that Pittsburgh will now be forced to play 13 consecutive weeks in the regular season. That number could extend, if the team qualifies for the postseason and doesn't qualify for a first-round bye, which only the top seed in each conference earns.
 The NFL and NFL Players Association are investigating whether the Titans broke the league's COVID-19 protocols. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a memo Monday that "Protocol violations that result in virus spread requiring adjustments to the schedule or otherwise impacting other teams" could result in forfeits for the offending party.
 Roethlisberger, however, doesn't foresee that applying to the rescheduled game against the Titans.
 "I don’t think they will consider forfeiting our game (against the Titans), and of course, we got the short end of the stick," Roethlisberger told reporters Wednesday morning.
 Pittsburgh is now scheduled to play the Baltimore Ravens on Week 8, when the Steelers and Ravens' bye had originally been set. The Steelers and Titans are scheduled to make up their postponed game on Week 7.
 Roethlisberger has led Pittsburgh to a 4-0 start in his return from an elbow injury that knocked him out of the 2019 season.
 "Well, the league already tried to slow it down, so I guess I’m going to start back over from scratch and hope this week I didn’t take too many steps backward," Roethlisberger said of trying to set benchmarks in his recovery. "Just try and see how it goes this week, I guess."
 Roethlisberger's remarks struck a markedly different tone from those of Steelers coach Mike Tomlin, who said he'd prepare his team to play whenever games are scheduled.
 "We are moving within our normal rhythm, but we acknowledge when we come in here day-to-day that we could have to adjust," Tomlin said Tuesday. "And when we have to, we do, and we will. But, we won’t spend a lot of time putting together proposals and counter proposals and contingency plans based on the ball that may or may not drop. That’s just not prudent use of time from our perspective."

 # In about-face, Trump seeks to salvage parts of virus aid
 Andrew Taylor and Aamer Madhani
 Associated Press
 View Comments
 _Washington_ – The White House on Wednesday tried to salvage its favorite items lost in the rubble of COVID-19 relief talks that President Donald Trump blew up, with his administration pressing for $1,200 stimulus checks and a new wave of aid for airlines and other businesses hard hit by the pandemic.
 In a barrage of tweets, Trump pressed for passage of these chunks of assistance, an about-face from his abrupt and puzzling move on Tuesday afternoon to abandon talks with a longtime rival, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The California Democrat has rejected such piecemeal entreaties all along.
 Trump’s tweets amounted to him demanding his way in negotiations that he himself had ended.
 He called on Congress to send him a “Stand Alone Bill for Stimulus Checks ($1,200)” – a reference to a preelection batch of direct payments to most Americans that had been a central piece of negotiations between Pelosi and the White House.
 “I am ready to sign right now. Are you listening Nancy?” Trump said on Twitter Tuesday evening. He also urged Congress to immediately approve $25 billion for airlines and $135 billion the Paycheck Protection Program to help small businesses.
 Trump’s decision to scuttle talks between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Pelosi came after the president was briefed on the landscape for the negotiations – and on the blowback that any Pelosi-Mnuchin deal probably would have received from his GOP allies in Congress.
 “It became very obvious over the last couple of days that a comprehensive bill was just going to get to a point where it didn’t have really much Republican support at all,” White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said Wednesday on Fox News. “It was more of a Democrat-led bill, which would have been problematic, more so in the Senate than in the House.”
 The unexpected turn could be a blow to Trump’s reelection prospects and comes as his administration and campaign are in turmoil. Trump is quarantining in the White House with a case of the coronavirus, and the latest batch of opinion polls shows him significantly behind Democrat Joe Biden with the election four weeks away.
 Trump’s withdrawal from the talks came immediately after he spoke with the GOP leaders in Congress, Many Republican senators had signaled they would not be willing to go along with any measure that topped $1 trillion, and GOP aides had been privately dismissive of the prospects for a deal. Any Pelosi- sponsored agreement of close to $2 trillion raised the potential of a GOP revolt if such a plan came to a vote.
 Pelosi and Mnuchin talked briefly on Wednesday morning about the chances for a stand-alone airline rescue, Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill tweeted. Pelosi directed Mnuchin to a measure she had attempted to pass on Friday on short notice under fast-track procedures, but only after Democrats made a number of changes Republicans did not like.
 The talks have been troubled from their start in July and never appeared to close in on an agreement both sides could embrace.
 Pelosi had been demanding a host of Democratic wins on food aid, unemployment benefits, help for renters and homeowners, and aid to state and local governments. Republicans charged she was dragging the talks to deny Trump a political victory before the Nov. 3 election.
 Early rounds of virus aid passed by overwhelming margins as the economy went into lockdown in March. After that, Trump and many of his GOP allies focused on loosening social and economic restrictions as the key to recovery instead of more taxpayer-funded help.
 Still, the decision to halt negotiations now could be politically perilous. While the stock market has clawed much of its way back after cratering in the early weeks of the crisis, unemployment stands at 7.9%, and the nearly 10 million jobs that remain lost since the start of the pandemic exceed the number that the nation shed during the entire 2008-09 Great Recession.
 The economy has recovered more quickly than most economists had expected, largely because of the aid Congress approved in a $2 trillion package in March. The $1,200 stimulus checks, supplemental $600 unemployment benefits each week, and aid to small businesses boosted household incomes and enabled many low-income Americans to pay bills and rent and maintain their overall spending, according to data from Opportunity Insights.
 But the recovery has slowed and certain sectors such as restaurants, hotels, theaters and airlines remain in bad shape, shedding jobs and risking permanent realignment. Without more stimulus, economists expect growth will slow significantly in the final three months of the year.
 “You’re going to see quite a significant drag on growth,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, a consulting firm. It “would really risk a double-dip recession.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House is trying to salvage its favored proposals for coronavirus aid now that President Donald Trump has ended negotiation with Democrats. Trump has used a flurry of tweets to press for Congress to approve $1,200 stimulus checks and new aid for airlines and other businesses hard hit by the pandemic. It's an about-face from his abrupt move on Tuesday to abandon talks with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She has rejected such piecemeal entreaties all along. Pelosi did speak with Trump's treasury secretary on Wednesday morning about the possibility of passing a rescue bill just for the airline industry.

Tanti esordi, passi in avanti sul piano del gioco, ma soprattutto il primo punto della stagione. C'e tutto questo nello 0-0 che il Palermo oggi pomeriggio ha strappato a Terni contro i ragazzi di Cristiano Lucarelli, una delle squadre favorite per la promozione. Al Liberati buona prova dei rosanero, bravi sia a contenere che a ripartire. Ok soprattutto il primo tempo dove probabilmente gli uomini di Boscaglia meritavano piu di quanto raccolto, discreta la ripresa nonostante i rosa siano ancora distanti da una condizione ottimale. Bene il centrocampo, reparto che continua a dare certezze e che dal prossimo turno di campionato potra contare anche sull'apporto di Luperini. Viene da chiedersi a questo punto quanto potra essere protagonista il francese Martin. Delude Saraniti, troppo macchinoso in avanti e ombra costante di un esplosivo Rauti. Appuntamento a domenica prossima, quando i rosa ospiteranno l'Avellino al Barbera.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House on Wednesday tried to salvage its favorite items lost in the rubble of COVID-19 relief talks that President Donald Trump blew up, with his administration pressing for $1,200 stimulus checks and a new wave of aid for airlines and other businesses hard hit by the pandemic.
 In a barrage of tweets, Trump pressed for passage of these chunks of assistance, an about-face from his abrupt and puzzling move on Tuesday afternoon to abandon talks with a longtime rival, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The California Democrat has rejected such piecemeal entreaties all along.
 Trump's tweets amounted to him demanding his way in negotiations that he himself had ended.
 He called on Congress to send him a “Stand Alone Bill for Stimulus Checks ($1,200)” — a reference to a preelection batch of direct payments to most Americans that had been a central piece of negotiations between Pelosi and the White House.
 “I am ready to sign right now. Are you listening Nancy?” Trump said on Twitter Tuesday evening. He also urged Congress to immediately approve $25 billion for airlines and $135 billion the Paycheck Protection Program to help small businesses.
 Trump's decision to scuttle talks between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Pelosi came after the president was briefed on the landscape for the negotiations — and on the blowback that any Pelosi-Mnuchin deal probably would have received from his GOP allies in Congress.

Our preliminary design calculation is a 70% reduction in CO2 I compared to a typical facility. Secondly, we will produce DEF, which reduces the emissions profile of diesel trucks and equipment.” DEF has been EPA mandated for new diesel engines since 2008 and eliminates 90% of nitrogen oxide emissions while improving fuel consumption by 3 to 4%. “We will be producing our own shale gas onsite for power and as feedstock. Our gas will move through our own new gathering system from our own new wells, resulting in a closed methane system and ideal to monitor and remediate fugitive methane emissions.

HAMILTON – Nettleton forced four sets in its first game back from quarantine, but Hamilton came away with the 3-1 win last Monday night.
 Hamilton won the first two sets 25-15 and 25-16 before Nettleton forced the fourth set with a 25-22 win in the third set. The Lady Lions secured the win with a 25-22 win in the fourth set.
 “They came out rocky in the first couple of sets, and of course they hadn’t played in a few weeks,” Hamilton coach Bryan Loague said. “We came out on fire and lost focus there. The first set we hit every serve in, and the second set we hit four out and the third one we hit five out. The fourth set we had maybe just one out. They got better as the day went on. You have to give them credit because they are going to be okay.”
 After Hamilton won the first set by a commanding 25-15 score, Nettleton opened the second set with a kill by Melly Gardner. The Lady Lions pushed ahead 6-2 behind a pair of aces from Aniston Atkins, but Nettleton tied the game on a kill from Kaillee Grace Inmon and an ace from Zyah Gunter.
 Mallory Kendall helped push Hamilton back in front with an ace, and the Lady Lions rode the momentum to the 25-16.
 The two teams went back and forth in the third set with Nettleton finally able to take the lead behind a pair of aces from Caroline Riley. Aaliyah Harris had a pair of kills in the set, and the Lady Tigers were able to secure the 25-22 win as Sharman Mosely had a kill after Hamilton cut it to one.
 Kendall opened up the final set with an ace, and after the game was tied midway through, Hamilton pushed back ahead behind a kill from Lann Hollis and an ace from Kendall.
 Nettleton tied the game at 22-22, but Madison Mitchell had back-to-back aces to regain the lead, and Mollie Cockerham finished off the 25-22 win with a kill.
 “Madison Mitchell came through at the end with some big serves,” Loague said. “We hit it well at times, and Aniston (Atkins) came in and got a bunch of serves in. She had 27 serves and all of them were in.”
