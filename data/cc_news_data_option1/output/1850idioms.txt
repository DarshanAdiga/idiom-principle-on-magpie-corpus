          \"Over the hills and through the woods, to Grandma's house we go\", many of us remember singing from our childhoods. If we were able to have those treasured times with our grandparents we were blessed. As a child growing up in the parsonage, it meant living all across the states with plenty of transitions. Grandma's house was the cherished place that resembled being constant. Summers my parents would put me on a plane as a very young girl and I would fly miles to her quaint home in the country that was nestled on a gravel road in Richland County, Illinois. Holidays my family would often trek clear across the country to be with my grandparents, it was the highlight of growing up. Traditions that were instilled then, are now carried on in my own children's homes, from those early years.          As soon as I saw her warm face and the welcoming embrace that took me in, my entire heart sang. The summers did not hold grand adventures to theme parks, but the simple every day togetherness that to this day holds some of my most cherished memories. Mornings that woke me with the scent of bacon, if I close my eyes can see the country kitchen and see my Grandpa making toast. Playing paper dolls on the front porch, waiting patiently for a car to pass, so I could wave. To this day the sound of gravel on a winding road is like a path to being in her arms, makes it all cascade instantly back to mind.          Visions of homemade noodles drying on the table, is something that is one of those things that comes to mind of Grandma's house. Just as much as how she could always make a meal out of nothing if someone stopped by. Hearing music played around the piano most probably is one of the reasons I learned to play as well. Every time I hang out clothes ,her voice echoes gently instructing me the proper way of doing such. The smell of fresh cut hay brings back trips to the barn to feed the livestock and frolicking in the loft. Escaping from the city was the best summer vacation ever, most likely why it was chosen later in life as a permanent choice.          My most treasured memory is the times going to the old country Church and the weekly tradition she had of always having that stick of gun waiting for me on the way there. The creek nearby, the sweet harmony of the old hymns and the gentle spirit that was felt there, makes it a hallmark place of sacred sentiment.          Find comfort at the glimpses of the quilts that adorn my home throughout the day that grandma made, it is as if a small piece of her stays near me. Sometimes just driving by her homestead, brings transcending peace that she bestowed. Miles of fields, serenity and capturing that glimpse of where childhood memories last and time stands still.          Ode to Grandmas, may we be blessed to be that oasis for our little ones, so they can remember us and hopefully pass on those timed traditions for those generations to live on forever more.

In Ohio, troopers have had drivers use COVID-19 to try to get out of a ticket, according to Lt. Craig Cvetan with the Ohio State Highway Patrol. In early March, an officer had pulled someone over for speeding, and the man behind the wheel told the officer that he had tested positive for the virus, Cvetan said, hoping the reasoning would get him out of a ticket.
 The officer notified emergency management and the state’s Department of Health, Cvetan said. The DOH, in an attempt to track cases, then made contact with the speeder.
 “That person then provided fictitious information about when and where they got tested,” Cvetan said in a recent interview.
 When the DOH discovered the information given to them was false, they notified police, who handed out additional charges to the offender.
 Costly choice
 In Virginia, anything over 80 mph or 20 mph over the speed limit is considered reckless driving, but they’ve still seen an uptick in people hitting speeds over 100 mph, according to Virginia State Police Sgt. Brent Coffey.
 He said troopers have maintained visibility throughout the state by issuing speeding tickets and reminding drivers “that an open road is not an open invitation to speed.”
 From January to April 23, there have been 224 traffic deaths across the state, compared with 226 from the same time frame last year, according to preliminary data, Coffey said.
 Virginia State Police spokesperson Corinne Geller said she would have expected the fatalities to decrease because there is less traffic on the roads.
 “Unfortunately, our fatalities are not down,” she said. “Overall, crashes have decreased, but the fatalities have not gone down, and a lot of them are due to speed and failure to buckle up.”
 In Kansas, there are now more deaths related to COVID-19 than there are traffic in 2020, according to public information officer for Northcentral Kansas Ben Gardener. He recently posted on Twitter that so far this year, there have been 110 traffic deaths in the state, and 124 coronavirus deaths.
 If people don’t slow down, however, those numbers could change. Gardener said that even though traffic in his state is lighter, people are traveling much faster than usual.
 “Our troopers are aware of it, and we’re addressing and giving tickets,” Gardener said.
 Enforcement changes
 For some states, a significant drop in traffic has resulted in few tickets across the board. That’s why New York State’s March speeding tickets were down 38 percent from last year, according to Beau Duffy, director of public information for the New York State Police.
 Pennsylvania speeding tickets are also down significantly. In fact, crime in general has dropped about 60 percent across the state during the pandemic, according to Trooper Brent Miller, director of the PSP communications office.
 In March, Pennsylvania troopers issued 131 citations for speeds over 100 mph, an increase from the same month last year, which had 123 citations, Miller said. April saw a significant decrease, however. From April 1 to 26, they issued 69 of those citations, compared with last year’s 151 in the same timeframe.
 According to the Ohio State Highway Patrol Statistical Analysis Unit, speeding citations for 20 mph over the limit were down by nearly 5,000, during the timeframe of March 23 to April 19, when compared with 2019 and 2018. However, the 100 mph citations for the same timeframe in 2020 matched 2019’s 130 citations and 2018’s 159 citations.
 Lt. Cvetan said those numbers could have been affected by the fact that patrol officers aren’t spending as much time on lesser traffic offenses. He said patrol officers, typically dedicated to highways, have been pulled in other pandemic-related directions in the past few months, like transporting N95 masks for sterilization and transporting food supplies for Meals on Wheels programs.
 He said they’re doing more rest area checks and they’ve been helping with perimeter and security checks at correctional institutions.
 “Because we’ve been tasked with other things, some of those lower traffic violations, they’re not necessarily focusing on right now,” Cvetan said. “These are unprecedented times for all law enforcement. We’re doing things we normally wouldn’t do.”
 Gardener said that Kansas troopers were already being very careful when approaching vehicles at a traffic stop, but now, COVID-19 is another consideration. He said to maintain social distance, troopers are staying further away from car windows, or approaching offenders from the passenger side of the car.
 They’re also writing down information from licenses and registrations, instead of taking those items into their vehicles, Gardener said. They all have masks and gloves to use should they need to come in close contact with the public during incidents or arrests, he said.
 “Our day is ever changing,” Gardener said. “We’re going to adapt to the new challenges to make sure our roadways are safe.”

This final note was necessary in light of the Grand Chamber’s reasoning in _N.D. and N.T. v Spain_, where the applicants argued that they were subjected to a collective expulsion after their immediate return to Morocco. The Court found that the applicants were within the Spanish jurisdiction (they were on Spanish territory) and that they were indeed subjected to an ‘expulsion’ within the meaning of Article 4 Protocol 4. The final issue that had to be resolved was whether the ‘expulsion’ was ‘collective’. The Court made the answer to this question dependent on whether there were ‘genuine and effective means of legal entry’ (para 201), such as border procedures and visa applications at embassies and consulates (para 212 and 222), that the applicants could effectively make use of. While a stronger emphasis was placed on the availability of border procedures, the Court in _N.D. and N.T. v Spain_ also reasoned that the applicants could have taken advantage of existing procedures for claiming international protection at Spanish embassies and consulates (para 223-228). This gave the basis for the Court to eventually conclude that the absence of individual identification and assessment of the applicants’ circumstances could be justified, and was thus not ‘collective’ in violation of the prohibition of collective expulsion, since the applicants did not take advantage of existing legal entry procedures.                  *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

"So while I was paying for the groceries, I exchanged it for another similar National Lottery Scratchcard, and bought an extra one for good measure.

The 1982 _Thing_ corresponds more closely to the original Campbell novella. In particular, the Campbell dwells on the tests to distinguish humans from the inhuman Thing. Speculation begins after the Huskies (not “Russkies”) start howling and thrashing against their cage and the Antarctic crew catches the dog in mid-Thing. Next, Blair (Wilfred Brimley) retreats to a remote shack and barricades himself inside. He wants to prevent himself from taking action against the others because he has figured out they all must die to deny the Thing any chance of leaving Antarctica. MacReady (McReady in the novella) takes charge and starts conducting the tests to determine who’s been made into a Thing. The liberal use of fire to destroy all Things that are Thing-like comes from the book. In the final showdown, going back to Blair, he’s been using his time in the shack to secure, not stop, the Thing’s takeover of Earth.                  *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

To buy or not to buy, that is the question; Whether it is nobler to shop local or to feed a corporate beast.                           I pull up in front of Wal-Mart and look at the labyrinth of orange cones and caution tape. Corona zombies mindlessly meander within the lines, and stop every 6 feet for the tape bar across the makeshift cattle chute. The speakers blare out repetitive instructions, over and over. "Maintain social distancing. Please follow the arrows for one-way traffic in the aisles. Remember to have a nice day." It's creepy. It would remind me of a slaughterhouse, but those are supposedly closed. The gatekeeper has a homemade Spongebob-printed surgical mask pulled down to protect her chin and neck. The speaker keeps blaring. It reminds me of the repetitive TV celebrities telling me, "We're all in this together", while they're quarantined with their Cabana Boy and Personal Trainer and $12 designer ice cream. "We're all in this together." That could have been the motto over the gate at Auschwitz. For a fleeting moment I wonder if Gulags and other internment camps were invented at the Arkansas home of the superstore.                           I wonder if I want to go through a maze to buy anything. It seems ironic to park in a handicapped spot to be close to the door, and then walk a 5K to get in the building.                           I can get almost anything in the small businesses in town. I pull out my phone and look through the electronic shopping list. Milk and eggs are constantly on the list. I can get those at Wonder Mart and most of the time they're actually a little cheaper than in the mega marts. I'm also confident that the town's milk supply has never been in China, but the big stores may have routed virtually everything through the communist country.                           The next item is paint. Our lumber yard has paint, and the Dollar General does too. Walled-in Mart has a huge selection, and can custom mix. Still, there's that maze and the constant propaganda being broadcast like a subliminal message from Der Fuhrer. Do I really need that paint?                           I put 22 caliber ammunition on the list because I can't afford the bigger stuff that booms real good. I can get that in town too. It's cheaper at the big store but finding an employee to get it for me can be a problem. I usually have to look around for an "Associate" who has to call the Keymaster to peruse my FOID card to see if they can take my money. I bet if I started putting inventory in my pockets the Associates would miraculously appear. I never have to look for someone at our gun shop. I still have to show the FOID but I don't have to chase anyone down.                           I don't even have to put on the list to pick up prescriptions. As certified Geezers, we take pills all of the time. I know to get meds every time I get out of the recliner. Wal-Mart is the winner in that area. I'd have to drive a long way to go to a local pharmacy, so that makes it "not local". I can get pills shipped to the house from a mail-order pharmacy, but that's a problem if I need the medicine this century. Anyway, it's the big stores for the win in medicine.                           The way I see it, I only need Wal-Mart for pills and paint. The deal is that up until the KGB, or whoever, started manipulating the shopping there, it was pretty painless to buy everything during one stop. It was also the place we talked to people, but nobody seems to talk right now. Plus, who can talk while navigating a cattle chute while listening to Comrade Commie?

He told the media, on Monday, that whether the wrongdoings and discrepancies witnessed thus far do impact the results depend on their magnitude and the impact of said magnitude on the ballots cast. “Any electoral process, even if you have wrongdoing, the precedent has always been to look at the magnitude of the wrong doing to see if that magnitude could affect the results. For example, if you have an election where you come up with a count where the difference [gap between political parties] is 20, 30, 40 votes and the wrongdoing is 80 or 100 votes, there’s a serious problem because the wrongdoing exceeds the difference and therefore could impact on the final results,” he explained.                  *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

NEW YORK (AP) -- Just 0.7% of Major League Baseball employees tested positive for antibodies to COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus.                           The small number of positive tests, announced Sunday, was positive news for a sport pushing ahead with plans to start its delayed season.                           Researchers received 6,237 completed surveys from employees of 26 clubs. That led to 5,754 samples obtained in the U.S. on April 14 and 15 and 5,603 records that were used. The survey kit had a 0.5% false positive rate.                           Dr. Jay Bhattacharya of Stanford, one of the study's leaders, said the prevalence of the antibodies among MLB employees was lower than for the general population during testing in New York, Los Angeles, the San Francisco area and Miami.                           "I was expecting a little bit of a higher number," Bhattacharya said during a telephone news conference. "The set of people in the MLB employee population that we tested in some sense have been less affected by the COVID epidemic than their surrounding communities."                           Data for players was not separated in the study, and some MLB family members were included.                           Spring training was stopped March 12 and opening day was pushed back from March 26 because of the pandemic. MLB intends to give the players' association a presentation this week for a possible start to the season, and has said frequent testing would be necessary.                           Antibodies are produced by a person's immune system if they have been infected by a virus. These tests are different than the polymerise chain reaction (PCR) tests used to detect active infection.                           "By using two different technologies, both PCR to diminish the active virus, as well as the antibody, the serology tests, that will give you better information and may even be able to alleviate some of the concerns with false positives," said Daniel Eichner of the Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory in Salt Lake City. another of the study leaders.                           "So I would definitely advocate if anyone was going to put a program together to get their sport of their work back, is to utilize both different technologies," he said.                           The University of Southern California also participated in the study.                           Bhattacharya said MLB employees are younger than the overall population and took protective measures such as frequent hand washing when they reported to spring training in February, earlier than most people.                           No MLB employees have been known to have died from COVID-19.                           While the percentage of Los Angeles Angels employees with positive tests was the highest among teams, the error margin is too high to draw results because just 123 tests were included from the team.                           Bhattacharya called the results "both good and bad news" because they showed the virus has not spread widely in MLB but still has many baseballers left to target. Eichner said results could mean MLB employees had been diligent in use of personal protective equipment, such as masks.                           "If this population was social isolating and practicing good PPE, then it shows that that worked and it didn't get the spread in there," Eichner said. "And then the flip side of that is that means it's worked well, then they keep doing it."                           Sixty people tested positive in the raw data, and the figured was adjusted to about 42 to account for false positives and false negatives.                           Over 95% of the participants were under 65 and few reported comorbidities, according to Stanford medical student Bianca Mulaney, who authored the study.                           The Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati, Colorado and Miami did not participate, Bhattacharya said. A pre-print server will publish the study this week, and it will be sent to a journal for peer review.                           Test kits were provided by the Partnership for Clean Competition, which funds anti-doping research, and researchers worked for free.                           Mulaney said the prevalence of positive tests for antibodies was higher in areas that have been harder hit by the virus, such as New York, and lower in less-impacted areas, such as Ohio.                           "This is a special population. It's not it's not representative of the American population at large," Bhattacharya said. "But it's an important population because it allows us to get a peek at the nationwide prevalence."                  *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

          Business will change, perhaps forever due to the coronavirus (covid-19). Once Uganda emerges from this crisis, business managers especially in the tourism sector have to reinvent their product offers to survive in the post-coronavirus economy.       In all his presidential addresses, President Museveni admitted that one of the sectors that have been hit hard and will take time to it recover is tourism sector.       Additionally, World Tourism Organisation (WTO) last month warned that the tourism industry is “one of the hardest-hit’ as lockdowns on land; in air and on water has brought business crashing’.       However, players in a sector that contributed Shs8.3 trillion worth of GDP by 2018 admitted that things are not going to be good in the short run but that does not stop them from planning after Covid-19.          Herbert Byaruhanga, the vice chairperson of Uganda Tourism Association (UTA), says the most important thing tour operators should do is to stay alive and keep communicating with the world.       He explained that players should spend more time and resources should be focused on social media marketing telling their clients that they are still in business.       “Clients must see you. They should be able to feel you. Companies; should invest more in creating blogs, doing online conferences, uploading videos on whatever they are doing and plan to do, this gives clients confidence,” he said.          Mr Byaruhanga added; “Those who have money should hire excellent content writers to sell their business. It is time to carry out research and understand what is likely to take place after Covid-19.”       Just like the tour association, Eng Ivan Batuma, the chairperson at the Kigezi Tourism Cluster, says strategies should be lined out and online presence should be felt.       “We are working online as well as doing general maintenance. It is sad that we had to let our staff go because of the slow business but we have not allowed to be forgotten,” he said.          Planning        Eng Batuma said the plan is how to make domestic tourism work as they wait for other countries to open up their airports and borders.       “We are now thinking of how to develop discounted short term for the local market, definitely the international market will take time; at least 12 months,” he said.          Tourism after Covid-19       Mr Byaruhanga said after the Covid-19, the mode of tourism is likely to change and clients are likely to do shorter trips for fear of contracting the disease. So players should think about doing things the unusual way.       “We must think about how we redesign our products and services, instead of having the traditional 15-20 days,” he said.       Mr Byaruhanga also said tourists will want to go to countries that were not so badly hit by the disease for safety reasons and good conditions for travel.       “In America, Britain, people are still in their houses and are not travelling much so this is the time to do research online,” he said.       Additionally Mr Byaruhanga urges tourism players to get in touch with the old clients through emails.          Government should also vigorously market the industry through the private sector and Uganda Tourism Board (UTB).       “We need to be visible, competition is going to be higher; America, intra-African competitions, Asia all will be competing with us hence we must wake up because they have better products,” he said.       Mr Byaruhanga also said players should be ready to train and retool staff; people are going to leave and others will come in.                  *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

"Over the hills and through the woods, to Grandma's house we go", many of us remember singing from our childhoods. If we were able to have those treasured times with our grandparents we were blessed.  As a child growing up in the parsonage, it meant living all across the states with plenty of transitions.  Grandma's house was the cherished place that resembled being constant.  Summers my parents would put me on a plane as a very young girl and I would fly miles to her quaint home in the country that was nestled on a gravel road in Richland County, Illinois. Holidays  my family would often trek clear across the country to be with my grandparents, it was the highlight of growing up. Traditions that were instilled then, are now carried on in my own children's homes, from those early years.                           As soon as I saw her warm face and  the welcoming  embrace that took me in, my entire heart sang.  The summers did not hold grand adventures to theme parks, but the simple every day togetherness that to this day holds some of my most cherished memories.  Mornings that woke me with the scent of bacon, if I close my eyes can see the country kitchen and see my Grandpa making toast. Playing paper dolls on the front porch, waiting patiently for a car to pass, so I could wave.  To this day the sound of gravel on a winding road is like a path to being in her arms, makes it all cascade instantly back to mind.                           Visions of homemade noodles drying on the table, is something that is one of those things that comes to mind of Grandma's house. Just as much as how she could always make a meal out of nothing if someone stopped by. Hearing music played around the piano most probably is one of the reasons I learned to play as well.  Every time I hang out clothes ,her voice echoes gently instructing me the proper way of doing such.  The smell of fresh cut hay brings back trips to the barn to feed the livestock and  frolicking in the loft. Escaping from the city was the best summer vacation ever, most likely why it was chosen later in life as a permanent choice.                           My most treasured memory is the times going to the old country Church and the weekly tradition she had of always having that stick of gun waiting for me on the way there.  The creek nearby, the sweet harmony of the old hymns and the gentle spirit that was felt there, makes it a hallmark place of sacred sentiment.                           Find comfort at the glimpses of the quilts that adorn my home throughout the day that grandma made, it  is as if a small piece of her stays near me. Sometimes just driving by her homestead, brings transcending peace that she bestowed. Miles of fields, serenity and capturing that glimpse of where childhood memories last and time stands still.                           Ode to Grandmas, may we be blessed to be that oasis for our little ones, so they can remember us and hopefully pass on those timed traditions for those generations to live on forever more.                  *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

During the pandemic, public officials and health care providers have run into repair monopoly barriers such as long wait times, limited traveling technicians, and patented parts, as they scramble to bring more medical repair in-house and build arsenals of critical equipment, including lifesaving ventilators. Major manufacturers such as General Electric, Fisher & Paykel, and Medtronic recently caved to advocates’ urging to make some manuals and repair information public or available by request. But Medtronic, for instance, has yet to make all its ventilator manuals available, and other ventilator manufacturers, including Vyaire Medical and Dräger, still have restricted access to manuals. In the meantime, Good Samaritans are exposing themselves to legal risk by publishing medical device manuals, jail-breaking continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines to function as ventilators, or 3D-printing missing parts.                  *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange
