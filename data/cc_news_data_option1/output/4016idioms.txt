Repeated calls for help with COVID-19 testing in Cayuga County continue to fall on deaf ears in Albany, and that trend becomes more troubling by the day with local coronavirus cases on the rise and more people being required to get tested.


  Cayuga County officials have been doing all they can to stay on top of the situation, partnering with Auburn Community Hospital to hold drive-thru clinics and offering free testing last week with the assistance of Upstate University Hospital, but the county has also continually informed the public about options for testing in Onondaga and other counties and recently put out a statement encouraging people without a primary care physician to go out and get one, an indication that perhaps the county and ACH are in over their heads trying to keep up with demand.

And our engagements with the Law have betrayed the fact that we – each one of us in the LGBTQ+ community – have actually had more engaging exchanges with Life. What do I mean? I mean, we’re willing to expect and accept less from the Law than Life. While in Life, we’re willing to leave our birth families to make our own warm fuzzy feeling somewhere else, boldly walk down streets holding fear like a burning ball in the core of our bellies, swish in and out of categories like they're changing rooms, find ways to make each other sing the body electric, fashion flesh to our bidding and so on. But from the Law, we’re convinced that we must be happy with our lot, which is little. We don’t ask for the moon and the stars but seek the scraps granted to us. We nibble, we never bite.

Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump and his allies looked to capitalize on his discharge from the hospital on Monday, painting his return to the White House as a triumphant metaphor for his strength and vigor a month before Election Day.


  The president highlighted a supporter saying his return to the campaign trail would make him an “invincible hero.” A campaign spokesman chided Joe Biden, his Democratic opponent, for lacking the experience of contracting and beating the coronavirus, while lawmakers tweeted Internet memes about Trump defeating the virus in battle.


  Trump, at the same time, pointed to his own experience to implore Americans not to fear the virus, shortly before a staged return to the White House that saw him defiantly remove his mask and pose for photos as he entered the residence.


  The president’s behavior may excite his strongest supporters, but the risk for him is that it will cement broader perceptions he’s been too cavalier about the spread of the virus and the threat it poses. That was underscored on Monday when three more White House aides, including Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany, were reported to have been infected. And an ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted after Trump’s diagnosis found that 72% of voters thought he had not taken the threat of contracting the disease seriously enough.


  “Don’t let it dominate you,” Trump said in a video posted to Twitter after his return. “Don’t be afraid of it. You’re gonna beat it. We have the best medical equipment, we have the best medicines, all developed recently.”


  In his Twitter video Monday, and others posted since he entered the hospital, Trump showed no recognition that as president, he received medical care beyond the expectations of most any other human. More than 7.4 million Americans have contracted the virus and 210,000 have died since February.


  Trump basked in the theater of his release from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland, carefully staged to coincide with broadcast networks’ evening newscasts. He dramatically walked out the hospital’s bronze front doors pumping his fist and flashing a thumbs-up to reporters.


  He was whisked away by the presidential helicopter, swooping over a crowd of supporters standing vigil outside the hospital. After he landed at the White House, he ascended the steps of the mansion’s South Portico to the second- story balcony. The entire journey was covered live across broadcast and cable networks.


  On the balcony, Trump removed his mask, flashed a double thumbs-up and then saluted the departing Marine One helicopter. His political opponents pointed out that he appeared to be breathing heavily, and the word “gasping” began to trend on Twitter.


  Yet the moment was so picture-perfect that the president, still without a mask, re-emerged from the White House residence minutes later with a camera crew in tow to re-shoot his dramatic return.


  In his Twitter video, Trump defended behavior his critics have called reckless before he contracted the virus, including seldom wearing a mask and gathering large crowds of supporters at campaign rallies.


  “Nobody that’s a leader would not do what I did,” Trump said. “I know there’s a risk. I know there’s a danger.”


  He made his battle with Covid-19 the centerpiece of a campaign fundraising email sent early Tuesday morning.


  The president’s allies poured on the praise, underscoring the extent to which Trump and his team appear unbowed -- and even invigorated -- by his brush with a virus that has felled so many other Americans.


  Erin Perrine, a spokeswoman for Trump’s campaign, drew attention for a remark about the president’s experience, including his personal fight against Covid-19.


  “He has experience as commander-in-chief, he has experience as a businessman, and he has experience now fighting the coronavirus as an individual,” Perrine said in a Fox News interview. “Those firsthand experiences, Joe Biden, he doesn’t have those.”


  After criticism, she said later in a tweet that “the point I was making is that first-hand experience changes the way any individual talks about or relates to something.”


  Senator Kelly Loeffler, a Georgia Republican, tweeted a video of Trump, participating in a WWE wrestling match before his presidency, body-slamming a man with an image of a virus superimposed over his face. Florida Representative Matt Gaetz repurposed an old Chuck Norris joke to praise the president.


  Democrats weren’t amused, regarding the spectacle as more of the same sort of attitude that led to the White House outbreak in the first place.


  Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, pointed out that the president’s treatment – which included a team of dedicated doctors, access to an experimental medicine, helicopter flights and a sprawling hospital suite – was not likely to be the experience for most Americans.


  “The president’s incompetence has already gotten 200,000 killed,” he said in a tweet on Monday criticizing a Trump tweet in which the president admonished Americans against fearing the virus.


  “The consequences of this tweet will probably kill a couple thousand more,” Murphy said. “Just bone chilling.”


  Separately, the president’s campaign said he still intends to be ready for his next debate with Biden on Oct. 15 in Miami, just two weeks after he received his first positive test for Covid-19.


  “We are seeing the president who is so tough, such a fighter, returned back and get ready to go right back at it, just days after being diagnosed,” Trump’s former press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said during Fox News coverage of his return.


  For Trump’s campaign, the hope is that the heroic depiction of his ordeal and recovery from the virus can improve his standing among voters – particularly those who have soured on his handling of the deadly pandemic.


  Biden held a 53%-39% lead over the president among registered voters in an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released over the weekend. More than half of respondents – 52% - said Biden would do a better job dealing with the coronavirus, while just 35% said the same of Trump.


  Double Gamble


  But the president is also gambling – both with his return to the White House and his political posturing – that his rapid recovery from the virus will hold. A return to the hospital would be both a concerning development for his health and further reinforcement of perceptions that he’s been impatient with the virus at every turn.


  White House physician Sean Conley said he was encouraged by the president’s progress Monday, but also acknowledged the potential for regression, saying it would be a week before the medical staff could “take that final deep sigh of relief.”


  “He may not entirely be out of the woods yet,” Conley said.

Nash brought Marley to London in the early 1970s when Nash was the bigger star internationally and with Marley gave an impromptu concert at a local boys school. Nash’s covers of “Stir It Up” and “Guava Jelly” helped expose Marley’s writing to a general audience.

For the first time since the tragic car accident that claimed his father's life, New England Patriots running back James White talked about his dad following Monday's game with the Kansas City Chiefs.
 White, who played at Fort Lauderdale St. Thomas Aquinas, credited his father for him playing football and reaching the NFL.
 "He meant a whole lot," White told reporters. "He's one of the biggest reasons why I play football. Being a little kid, seeing my brother play, knowing that my dad played football. That kind of motivated me to go out there and play football. My dad, he was a coach for me growing up. Obviously, it was not always fun having your dad be your coach, but he pushed me and made me who I am today.
 "I miss getting those texts that he usually sent me on Saturday nights before games ... just the simple texts he would send to get me prepared for the games. I kind of look back at the last text I got on Saturday before the Seahawks game and kind of reminisce on that, but he meant everything for me. He pushed me. Wouldn't always tell me what I wanted to hear, but he just always wanted me to do the right thing and push myself and be the best I can be."
 The accident happened Sunday, Sept. 20 in Cooper City, according to a previous Herald report. The car crash occurred when White's mother, Lisa, who was driving west on Griffin Road, turned onto Southwest 118th Avenue and was struck by Cooper City's Daniel Chamberlin, who was heading east on Griffin Road, in a "T-boning style crash," the Broward Sherrif's Office said.

During last week's presidential debate President Donald Trump called on his supporters "to go into the polls and watch very carefully."


   


  In Kansas, however, election officials said, an individual can't just show up at a polling place to do that.


   


  They have to meet specific criteria to be eligible as a "poll agent" or "poll watcher" and they must register with the local election officials to receive the designation in advance of the election, according to the Kansas Secretary of State's office.


   


  State laws also prohibit "electioneering" - which is any display in support of a specific candidate, issue or party - within 250 of the polling place.


   


  Reno County Election Officer Jenna Feger said local election officials have no concerns about poll watchers showing up at county polling places on Election Day, and that she welcomes them.


   


  "We've had them in the past and there've never been any issues," Feger said of poll watchers. "They aren't allowed to stop the process or anything like that. They just observe."


   


  "Basically they are just checking the process, making sure everything is going smoothly," she said. "Sometimes they have a list and are checking it off as people come through. If they know of people who haven't voted, they'll call them."


   


  In Kansas, however, "poll agents" are people authorized to be so because of the position they hold, said Katie Koupal, Deputy Assistance Secretary of State for Communication and Policy.


   


  Those include chairpersons of state and county political party committees; chairpersons of committees concerned with questions that are on a ballot, if any; candidates themselves or a member of their family aged 14 or older; precinct committeepersons; and write-in candidates who have filed affidavits of write-in candidacy.


   


  The qualified individuals may also appoint someone else to serve in their stead, but just one person per eligible category per polling place.


   


  "You can't send 10 people to the same polling place to observe," Koupal said.


   


  An application to become a poll watcher is available through the local election office or Secretary of State's Office. They must be submitted to the local election office for approval, but that can be done by mail, email, fax, or hand-delivered.


   


  "They are required to carry their appointment form and produce it upon request" at the polling place, Koupal said. "They also have to wear a badge identifying themselves as an observer."


   


  "They can't just show up," she said.


   


  Poll watchers can ask to see an unmarked ballot and watch the voting processes, but they are prohibited from handling a completed ballot, participating in the administration of the process, or ballot counting.


   


  "They are prohibited from hindering or obstructing any voter or election board worker in the performance of their duty," Koupal said. "They cannot be within three feet of a polling booth or a table used by election boards or staff."


   


  In Reno County, the local Democratic party has applied for watchers for the Nov. 3 election, Feger said, but so far no one else has.


   


  Local election officials attempt to address concerns that may be raised by poll watchers by having members of both major parties represented by poll workers at each precinct table, Feger said.


   


  "Typically we try to have one Republican and one Democrat at each table," she said. "They take turns, switching around in different positions (at the table) during the day."


   


  "Any board worker who feels something was not done correctly, we give them a phone number to call us, or at the Fairgrounds, we have people there and they can flag us down and bring it to our attention."


   


  Separate state law addresses electioneering at a polling place.


   


  The law defines electioneering as "knowingly attempting to persuade or influence eligible voters to vote for or against a particular candidate, party or question submitted. Electioneering includes wearing, exhibiting, or distributing labels, signs, posters, stickers, or other materials that clearly identify a candidate in the election or clearly indicate support or opposition to a question…"


   


  The activity is prohibited within 250 feet of the entrance of a polling place on Election Day or at an advance voting site. To visualize the distance, that's about 15 feet shy of a length of a football field.


   


  Bumper stickers affixed to a vehicle used to get to a polling place are excluded from the law, but it does include hats and T-shirts, Koupal said.

Well, no. Quite apart from the monstrousness of the ideology they spawned, there is plenty of evidence that racist themes and tropes did suffuse the thinking of both Marx and Engels. To put it in theological terms, they were guilty of three sins. The first was a sin of omission. Marxism”s foundational writings evince a profound indifference to, or perhaps ignorance of, race as an analytical category. The founding fathers of Marxism simply could not fit it into their formal theory of history, except perhaps to note that the world was more or less naturally divided into races, some of which were advanced and some retrograde. Nowhere in their revolutionary framework for understanding oppression, injustice, and inequality, is there any sense that race is an independent causal variable – or even a meaningful intervening one. Nowhere in their works does one find the category of race deployed as a means of understanding exploitation or oppression, except as an epiphenomenon of class conflict. And nowhere is there even a hint that the category of race or the reality of race might be the product of power-laden social relations other than those associated with capitalism. To put it the other way around, nowhere in their work is there even a hint that race might be anything other than an epiphenomenon of capitalism – that is, that race might be a driver of human history in the same way as class. Simply put, you can search high and low, hither and yon, but you will not find race as a meaningful category of thought or action in the entire oeuvre of these two iconic thinkers. While race occasionally intersected with class in their writings, the latter”s logic was always paramount, the logic of the former irrelevant to the point of near invisibility.

Music fans who know Bryan Porter Hinkley from his previous bands might be surprised by the sound of his brand new solo debut EP, "We Live Through It."


  That's because Hinkley, who now lives in Milton, is probably best known to local rock fans as part of Tree, the hardcore punk quartet that released half- a-dozen sizzling albums between 1993 and 2001. Later, Hinkley and his brother (and Tree drummer) Bill Hinkley formed Never Got Caught, which shifted their sound a bit into hard rock, and has put out four solid albums. In between all that, Hinkley did a stint in '99 playing guitar with Boston punk-rock legends Gang Green, and spent five years on the road as a tour guitarist with Maryland hard-rockers Clutch.


  So, will it turn heads to learn that Hinkley's solo effort, while maintaining that punky intensity and insouciant attitude, works in a folk-pop mode? The new EP, produced by Paul Gaster of the hard rock group Clutch, was recorded, written, and produced during the pandemic. Lyrically, Hinkley's songs suggest taking a new look at life in these days, seeking a sharper focus on what really matters.


  Want news like this sent straight to your inbox? Head over to PatriotLedger.com to sign up for alerts and make sure you never miss a thing. You pick the news you want, we deliver.


  "I think that's partially it," Hinkley agreed when we offered that interpretation. "That was definitely on my mind when the pandemic forced the world into kind of a pause. It brought on some forced introspection. But the overarching thought I was having was about time and change, and how it relates to people. We were all in a stand-aside mode. Lyrically I like to keep an abstract direction, rather than being super specific. That way, people can interpret as they want. I try to keep it loose, so more people can take it and relate it to their own experience."


  On the new EP, due out on October 16, the tune "Red Bull and Gasoline (Living for a Change)" is a surging folk-rocker, with words about finding a new way to look at life in America. The frenetic pace and swirling guitars of "Hand In the Fire," delivers a message about habits and patterns of behavior shaping us. "No Time" is probably the most punk-influenced number, what might accurately be called folk-punk, a rhythmic charge that deals with self-doubt and reassessing things.


  Hinkley will be performing the new music on The Town and The City Festival on October 23-24 on the Once Somerville virtual venue, and then has a virtual concert celebrating the new record on November 13, also on the Once Somerville virtual venue. The new music will also be available at HInkley's website, bryanporterhinkley.com.


  "That's just the style I'm doing now," said Hinkley. "I call it rock, really. I've always had pretty eclectic tastes. I love hardcore, punk, heavy metal, but I also grew up immersed in my mom's love of folk and bluegrass. I wanted to do an acoustic-based thing here. When people hear distorted guitar, they start to bang their heads and expect heavy metal. I wanted to make music you could listen to without being categorized as heavy rock. I think this style is more palatable for a wider audience, and I didn't want to limit myself to one audience. I wanted this record to be more open-ended, as far as who would want to listen to it."


  Hinkley's interest in many styles of music is reflected in the "day job" he has developed. His Gratitude Sound in Boston produces music for TV and radio ads, and also for TV shows and films. It allows him to use his creative side in a way he probably never imagined when he was growing up in Westwood as your typical rock fan, who also had a newspaper route delivering the Patriot Ledger.


  "For the past seven years I've been doing custom music for ads and I also license bands and performers getting their music into ads, or TV or films. I work with ad agencies that contact me and need a specific piece of music. I have a team of composers, besides myself, and we can do anything from hip-hop to orchestral music. It has been nice to be able to work in a different platform with a lot of my musical friends. Even before this, with streaming services, which are free or subscription, it had become tough for musical sales any other way. Vinyl has made a comeback, which is interesting, but the music market is not the same as it was in the 1990s. Change is inevitable I guess.


  "This business has definitely affected my own musical palette," Hinkley added. "When you're writing to someone's brief it forces you to do something you normally wouldn't. I've done some metal, some hip-hop, some quirky background music. But again, it's not always me writing and I know enough to get people who specialize in certain styles like hip-hop, and I stick to the styles I like to do."


  The demands of his studio work have limited Hinkley's performances recently, even before the pandemic put everyone on the sidelines. But a Tree reunion show at The Sinclair in Cambridge in 2015 -- with Never Got Caught opening -- was such an event Blue Hills Brewery produced a special Tree Beer for the occasion.


  "I've always had a small amount of stage fright, but I think it's a good thing," said Hinkley. "I had never played solo acoustic before, but seeing (Quincy's) Lenny Lashley and Jesse Ahern and how well they make it work really inspired me. Since my business tends to be all software, I really enjoy playing solo very much.


  "The new record is mostly me," Hinkley noted. "I've been working with ProTools for years and someone recommended a program called Able-ton that I used. But, it is essentially just me in my daughter's bedroom, which I turned into a little studio. I have a friend in Maryland who's a drummer and sent him my demos and he was excited. So, I was happy he agreed to do drums for me. Then, we brought it all to Mad Oak studio, located just above my business in Boston, and put it all together."

HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - A Waikiki man who was arrested in May for illegally carrying ammunition during a protest rally has now been charged with orchestrating email attacks on the Honolulu Police Department’s computers.Christian Grado, 29, remains behind bars after he was accused of sending thousands of emails to a server used to help report and enforce stay-at-home violations. Authorities characterized the attack as an email bomb.“It’s basically what we call a DNS -- a denial of service attack -- where they system gets overloaded with data coming in that it’s not able to handle and process all that data. It’s like clogging the pipes,” said former HPD cybercrime investigator Chris Duque.A criminal complaint filed Tuesday said that between Aug. 9 and Aug. 10, Grado used a program to send “2,292 emails ... or one email sent every 30 seconds for 20 hours straight.”“There were a lot of digital cookie crumbs left behind by the culprit,” Duque said.According to the complaint, HPD’s computer sleuths investigators were able traced the emails to Grado home on Ala Wai Boulevard, which they raided last month.Along with the computer evidence, sources said police also found drugs and ammunition. He was arrested on the drug charges on Sept. 24.According to his LinkedIn page, Grado is a dance instructor, an Army veteran and an expert marksman.After the attack, investigators looked into Grado’s social media accounts, searching for a possible motive.They found a GoFundme page showing Grado equipped with military gear and seeking donations to cover bail after was arrested in May.Police said he was arrested then for illegally carrying ammunition during a George Floyd/Black Lives Matter protest.His court-appointed attorney said he’s not dangerous.“Just noting that this is a non-violent offense,” said Deputy Public Defender Megan McDonald during Grado’s initial court appearance today.But prosecutors disagreed.“The defendant has prior arrests in 2020 for illegal possession of ammunition and also for a C felony for promoting a harmful drug," said Deputy Prosecutor Darryl Miyahira.Grado is next expected in court on Oct. 20.Copyright 2020 Hawaii News Now.

Given the Padres' pitching straits, however, the Dodgers may be even heavier favorites. Right-hander Mike Clevinger was a late addition to the roster and the surprise Game 1 starter after missing the final days of the regular season and the Wild Card Series because of arm problems. Unfortunately, just two pitches into the second inning Clevinger was removed with an undisclosed injury. Bear in mind that fellow starter Dinelson Lamet also remains sidelined with a biceps injury. Anyhow, the injury to Clevinger forced the Padres' bullpen to work hard -- nine San Diego pitchers were used in this one. And this comes after the San Diego bullpen was leaned on hard over the course of the three-game series win over the Cardinals in the first round. More ominous for the Padres is that the LDS schedule includes no off days. Down 1-0 and with a strained staff, the Padres are in a bad spot.

Out of the group, though, Amazon seems to have engaged in the most egregious anticompetitive behavior, especially in regards to third-party sellers on its marketplace platform. Earlier this year, the Wall Street Journal reported Amazon's employees used these vendors' data to inform the development of its own products. The company had previously vowed it would not use individual seller data to launch its private-label offerings, but the House investigation confirmed through several interviews with former employees and current sellers that Amazon had misused seller data and "routinely bullies and mistreats" them. And while Amazon publicly called third-party sellers "partners," the investigation showed that behind closed doors, it referred to them as "internal competitors." This is not great news for the nearly 2 million small and medium-sized businesses that sell on Amazon's platform, roughly 40% of which rely on the company's marketplace as their sole source of income.

At the age of 80, Abdul CK is still a child at heart as he goes about making handmade wooden toys with movable parts. As he attains fame through social media, Abdu _ikka_ (elder brother), as he is called, is happy that more children will get to enjoy the toys that he crafts from junk and wood.


  Years before Prime Minister Narendra Modi exhorted Indians to become a world- beater in toy-making, Abdu was making toys in Wayanad district in Kerala and selling it in different places like Pulpally, Kaniyambetta and Mananthavady in the district. Instead of selling it to a middleman, Abdu used to sell his toys himself. “I would go around rolling the toys I made and passers-by would stop to buy it. Pedestrians, those in cars...,” he says.

Then, with eight minutes left to play in the first half, Gambill put in a long goal that smashed into the left corner of the net to give Pulaski a 5-0 lead.


  Late in the half, Eli Buckles, who had two failed attempts earlier in the quarter, put in a goal for the Cardinals after a corner kick assist from Will McCowan. The goal put the game at 5-1 heading into halftime.


  After the break, and after two missed attempts by each team, Jesus Lopez kicked in a goal for South Laurel as Maroon goal keeper Howell dove for it and just missed it.


  Several minutes later, Dalton extended the Maroon lead back to four after sending in a penalty kick goal from the box. The goal gave the game its final score of 6-2 with about 24 minutes left to play. The defenses held the other team scoreless for the remainder of the half and Pulaski got the win.


  During the senior night game for Pulaski, the goals came exclusively from the Maroons senior class. This included three by Gambill, two by Dalton, and one from Coomer.


  "Good win against a team that absolutely dominated us last season and a great bounce back after last night's subpar performance," said McGahan. "All the seniors got a lot of time tonight and helped contribute to the win. This was a team win and the scoreboard reflected that."


  The win put the Pulaski County Maroons at 4-4-2 heading into their final regular season matchup tomorrow night where they will play the Mercer County Titans on the road. The loss dropped the South Laurel Cardinals to 5-6-2.


  "Hopefully we can take this energy and keep it going into the game Thursday at a tough Mercer County and continue into district next week." said McGahan.
