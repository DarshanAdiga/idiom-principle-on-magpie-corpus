The 34-year-old became the oldest player in Champions League history to score a hat-trick before then converting a penalty, which he had won himself, to put the seal on a sensational 4-0 win that sealed top spot in Group E for the Blues.
 Giroud had gone into the game having started just one previous game this season. However, he now has six goals to his name, averaging one every 45.5 minutes.
 "It was an amazing performance from Oli, to score four goals at this level, against a really good opponent," Lampard told reporters after the game.
 "There was the quality of goals but also his contribution to the team performance, so it was right that he got a standing ovation as he came off the pitch.
 "I'm delighted for him because he is the ultimate professional, and I think he's shown that throughout his career. I also think that's why Oli has such great numbers for France and in the Champions League.
 "He wasn't always a regular before I got here, but as soon as I came in I could feel the positivity off him as a player, in terms of how he wants to train and how he wants to affect people whether he starts or not.
 "So, he's started a lot for us now and been very impactful. He's a great example for younger players, but also guys that don't always start, which happens a lot as we have a squad of 20-plus players."

KUCHING, Dec 3 — Several Employees Provident Fund (EPF) contributors were seen queueing up outside the EPF office at Jalan Uplands here today to enquire on the recently announced i-Sinar withdrawal and other matters.
 When met by reporters, most contributors expressed that they were unclear on the terms and conditions to make a i-Sinar withdrawal, which was the reason why they rushed to the EPF office here.
 Ina Atam, 51, was one of the contributors in the long queue outside the EPF office.
 “The move to allow withdrawals from Account 1 is very good, especially for us who are affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.
 “If the withdrawal application is successful later, it will help lessen our burden, especially for me who is self-employed and only working as a cake seller,” she said when met outside the EPF office today.
 Ina and her husband, who hail from Kampung Sebako, in Lundu near here arrived at the EPF office this morning had at first lamented that their savings in Account 1 could not be withdrawn because they have not reached the mandatory age.
 However, she said with the recent announcement allowing withdrawals from Account 1 was a “huge relief”, as she plans to make good use of it to develop her cake business in the village further.
 Meanwhile, Rahmat Zaini, 35, said he did not understand the terms and conditions of the i-Sinar withdrawal, which was the reason whyhe and his wife Maya Rusandi, 34 were in line at the EPF office to enquire about the details.
 “I think it’s necessary for the government to grant us permission to withdraw from Account 1, especially for people like us who are affected because of the pandemic.
 “I had since left my job at the factory that I used to worked for which has ceased operations before the movement control order (MCO).
  “But since the pandemic hit, my own business which I set up with my wife has not been good either and at least this will help tide us over for the time being,” he said.
 The terms and conditions of the previously announced i-Sinar withdrawals from Account 1 can be obtained from our previous news report here. A more detailed explanation can also be obtained on the EPF website here.
 The first category encompasses contributors employed in the formal or gig economy sectors; those who are self-employed or have not contributed for a long time; housewives; as well as those who have lost their jobs or been put on unpaid leave.
 According to the EPF, members who have not contributed for at least two consecutive months or more at the time of application, or those who are still employed but facing basic salary cuts of 30 per cent or more after March 1 this year are eligible to apply for the facility.
 The second category comprises members who are still employed but facing a reduction of 30 per cent or more of their total earnings — which includes salaries, allowance and overtime pay — after March 1 this year, which can only be verified through supporting documents. — Borneo Post

KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 3 — Natural gas will continue to help bridge the inevitable energy transition and tackle the issue of climate change faced by the world, said Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin.
 He said Malaysia’s energy mix had been underpinned by natural gas for decades now and would be for the foreseeable future, but the country still had a long way to go in its journey towards a sustainable future.
 However, he expressed confidence in the collective minds and abilities to realise the energy transition, ensuring that today’s needs were met while addressing tomorrow’s challenges.
 “We look forward towards natural gas to play a pivotal bridging role for this energy transition, providing secure, affordable and sustainable baseload energy source in synergy with the growing, but often intermittent, renewable energy sources.
 “This synergy gives rise to significant investment opportunities, not only in upstream but across the value chain,” he said at the 7th International Energy Forum (IEF) — International Gas Union (IGU) Ministerial Gas Forum Virtual Roundtable which was held virtually today.
 The prime minister said the long-term outlook for gas was brighter than that of other fossil fuels because of its comparatively lower cost and lower emissions from production.
 To find a true competitive advantage amid a volatile market, gas players must refocus their efforts in capital efficiency, supply-chain optimisation, downstream market development, de-carbonisation as well as digital and advanced analytics, he said.
 “If done successfully, I believe gas could ride out an unpredictable market and find opportunities for faster growth not only in Malaysia, but the global market as a whole,” he said.
 Muhyiddin said technology would play a critical role in order to realise the positive future for gas.
 Gas producers, he said, could apply digital and advanced analytic techniques to realise significant hidden value potential.
 Only through these tech-investments, the role of natural gas in de-carbonising the energy sector vis-a-vis other energy.
 Muhyiddin said governments, in the design and implementation of policies, played a crucial role in shaping such opportunities.
 “Much will also depend on the capacity of investors to provide new solutions and navigate risks over the future direction of gas markets and technologies.
 “To this end, governments may provide incentives to key stakeholders to accelerate development, commercialisation and production of new technologies for energy transition,” he said.
 The prime minister said regulatory incentives might play a more effective role in encouraging energy innovation such as “regulatory sandboxes” policies that could create safe spaces for stakeholders in energy innovation to test their solutions in a live, but controlled, environment without being subject to normal regulatory requirements.
 He also pointed out that any further financial assistance needed to be used wisely.
 As some of the earlier experience with renewable subsidies in advanced markets showed, it could lead to a high taxpayer burden, over-capacity and eventual unsustainable costs for consumers when phased out, if not executed carefully, he added.
 Giving an update on Malaysia’s efforts in the energy sector, Muhyiddin said a Natural Gas Roadmap (NGR) was currently being developed that would form a key part of the overall National Energy Policy (NEP), which would be announced in the first quarter of next year.
  Thus, these upcoming documents would serve as an important policy framework in the energy sector under the 12th Malaysia Plan, 2021-2025, he said.
 “The NGR strives to optimise the value of indigenous gas resources, enhance security of supply and access to cost competitive gas, among others,” he said.
 Muhyiddin noted that numerous initiatives and infrastructure had been established to further grow the usage of gas within the country and beyond its shores.
 Malaysia’s global innovation in gas with the completion of the world’s first operational floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) facility in 2016 with the capacity to produce 1.2 million tonnes of LNG per year has allowed it to optimise previously stranded gas fields.
 This would be followed by the second FLNG which was expected to go into commercial operations next year, he added. — Bernama

 Mr. Rajinikanth explained how the pandemic had delayed his political entry. “In 2017, I had said that I will not contest in local polls and I will decide on Lok Sabha elections at that time. And I will start a political party before the State Assembly elections and contest in all 234 constituencies.”
 He added, “In Leela Palace hotel in March, I had said that we need to create an uprising among people and then I will start a party. I had planned to tour Tamil Nadu, but the COVID-19 pandemic made it impossible to do it.”
 Elaborating on his fragile health, Mr. Rajinikanth said, “Everybody knows that I have had a kidney transplant. The natural (body’s) immunity needs to be reduced to enable the body to accept a new organ. However, the body needs immunity to fight COVID-19. This is a big problem. Doctors advised that it was dangerous to meet people and campaign.” But now he had decided to take the plunge, he added.
 Mr. Rajinikanth said that prominent political activist Tamilaruvi Manian will supervise party activities along with R. Arjunamoorthy, who joined him after quitting as State BJP intellectual cell president.
