While impressions can be hard to change, highlighting and promoting what goes on 'behind the scenes', including the training, skills and drive needed to work in the industry, is key to elevate the standing of the estate agent profession. With expert local knowledge and an understanding of the wider property market, estate agents can become trusted advisors to their customers - delivering the high levels of satisfaction reflected in the BEIS study. However, to gain that trust, in a highly competitive market, agents need the right skills and qualifications.

Illinois obliterated another coronavirus record Friday with 15,415 new cases of COVID-19 reported, erasing the previous record by more than 2,700 cases.
   
 With the coronavirus pandemic showing no sign of easing, Gov. JB Pritzker on Friday also extended the moratorium on evictions for another 30 days.
   
 However, this latest extension comes with some new requirements aimed at preventing people who can afford to pay rent from trying to take advantage of the moratorium.
   
 The Illinois Department of Public Heath reported 27 additional deaths bringing the death toll to 10,504. The state now has a total of 551,957 confirmed and probable cases of the coronavirus since the onset of the pandemic.
   
 IDPH said 5,362 people are hospitalized with the virus, an increase of more than 100 from Thursday. There are 990 people in the intensive care unit, with 488 of them on ventilators. The statewide positivity rate climbed again to 13.2%.
   
 "They're awful. They're awful. We are at a crisis level," Pritzker said of the numbers at his daily briefing. "We are watching these numbers go up. There's got to be some personal responsibility that's taken not only by people for wearing masks, but also the local leaders who are taking no responsibility."
   
 Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike said the surge in cases is straining hospital resources.
   
 "We are seeing capacity decrease everywhere," Ezike said. "You have seen the numbers that have been put out, 100%, 200%, 300% increases depending on where you are. So everyone's capacity is being threatened."
   
 She said some hospitals have already begun postponing non-emergency procedures in order to ensure beds and staff are available for those who have acute medical problems.
   
 Pritzker, though, advised people not to panic.
   
 "Our hospitals are not overrun, but we have hospitalizations that are rising at a rapid rate and we want to make sure we don't' get to a point where patients are getting turned away," Pritzker said.
   
 As part of the eviction moratorium, the state has awarded $182 million to provide assistance to more than 36,000 renters who sustained financial hardship because of the pandemic. Renters must apply for the assistance, but the money goes directly to landlords.
   
 Another 4,300 homeowners affected by the pandemic received $36 million in mortgage assistance to prevent foreclosure on their homes.
   
 Pritzker said both the rental and mortgage assistance programs had twice as many applicants as available funds. He said additional financial aid should be provided by Congress.
   
 "But because we can't just wait around for the Republicans in the U.S. Senate to take action, I'll also be extending the moratorium on evictions," Pritzker said. "It's the right thing to do to protect our most vulnerable residents."
   
 Still, many landlords complained of tenants who simply stopped paying rent because they knew they could not be evicted. Pritzker said landlords need protections, too.
   
 "This new moratorium will ensure that the rents are paid by tenants who may have been taking advantage of the eviction moratorium, but who are in fact able to make their monthly rent payments," Pritzker said.
   
 That means people can make no more than $99,000 a year of income, or $198,000 if filing jointly, to be eligible for assistance.
   
 "Renters unable to pay will be required to submit a declaration to their landlord certifying that they are unable to pay their rent due to the substantial loss of income or an increase in out of pocket expenses stemming from the pandemic," Pritzker said.
   
 The Chicagoland Apartment Association issued a statement saying is "grateful that Governor Pritzker has fine-tuned his residential eviction moratorium so landlords are not taken advantage of by tenants who withhold payments that cause demonstrated financial loss due to COVID-19. The amended eviction moratorium announced today by Governor Pritzker provides greater accountability by non-paying bad actors."

This is roughly the time frame in which the Paris Agreement finds its aim of limiting "the [global] temperature increase […] to 1.5 degrees Celsius" (UNFCCC). Bear in mind, however, that these are targets which will not be easily achievable or attainable, and that they require continued and persistent international cooperation and commitment. They are extremely ambitious but are equally instrumental and indispensable in the building of a sustainable future. Thus this research, alongside other recent and upcoming IPCC reports, is a backdrop against which world leaders should be developing and following national and international climate goals and actions.

Because of NCAA restrictions on home visits due to COVID, the recruiting process unfolded a little differently. But Steve Rodriguez said that Baylor’s coaches weren’t exactly flying blind. Four of BU’s eight signees were committed to the Bears prior to the pandemic’s arrival, and the coaches were well-acquainted with the other four, too.
 “It was different, but I’ll be honest, we did not recruit a lot of kids who we had not seen before,” Rodriguez said. “There were some schools who were recruiting people left and right. We didn’t do that. We’ve had kids who were either at our camp, or we have had really reliable sources who feel comfortable saying, ‘Hey, what do you think about this guy? Hey, we have a guy.’

THE FACTS: Officials with the Oklahoma State Election Board said the video shows spoiled ballots where the voter marked more than one option. The ballots were discarded at a polling place. In a video viewed more than 150,000 times on Twitter, two men claim to have found ballots marked for Trump when they went out to take out the trash during a wedding at a church. We wanted to show you what we found,” one man says. The men then remove ballots from a trash bag, going through each one to show votes from Trump. “This is even happening in Oklahoma guys,” said one of the men, noting that Oklahoma votes “red” and overwhelmingly supported Trump. The Instagram video received thousands of shares online with some posts suggesting the men were in Nevada. The posts shared the video to allege fraud in the 2020 election. “Patriots at wedding in Oklahoma find DISCARDED & torn up ballots that were TRUMP VOTES! Isn’t it interesting… when WE find ballots that were thrown away they’re ALWAYS TRUMP Votes But when THEY find ballots that were not counted yet they’re ALWAYS ALL Biden VOTES,” one Twitter post said. The Oklahoma State Election Board addressed the video on Twitter explaining that it showed spoiled ballots in Tulsa County where the voter marked more than one option in a race. The board also shared a photo of affidavits signed by voters acknowledging their ballots were spoiled. “Here are screen shots from the video that clearly show the ballots have been spoiled,” the board said on Twitter. “We also are posting a redacted Spoiled Ballot Affidavit signed by voters before their spoiled ballots were destroyed.”

Ma'a Nonu may be 38 years of age, but the ex-All Black centre showed glimpses of his former glittering past in an assured comeback for Toulon in their comprehensive 38-9 Top 14 victory over Agen on Saturday.
 More than 900 days since he last turned out for Toulon, the two-time World Cup winner, capped 103 times by New Zealand, again proved a menacing presence in midfield, against an Agen side that has now lost all nine games this season.
 Nonu bossed Toulon's effective defence, producing a couple of turnovers and a solid tackling display, albeit against the club which has not only the worst attacking record of the Top 14, but also the worst defensive one.
 A slick one-step pass by Nonu's Australian midfield partner Duncan Paia'aua enabled winger Erwan Dridi a clear run in for the opening try.
 The Kiwi's attacking guile was demonstrated as he produced a deft grubber through that was collected on the Agen line by Fijian flanker Masivesi Dakuwaqa for try number two.
 France scrum-half Baptiste Serin missed the two conversions, having hit an early penalty.
 Two Paul Abadie penalties, allied with a Jean-Marcellin Buttin drop-goal, kept Agen in the game at 13-9 at half-time.
 The tide quickly changed in the second half, Tongan half-back Sonatane Takulua, with literally his first touch of the ball after coming on for Isaia Toeava, darting over from close range after an effective attacking line-out.
 Theo Dachary, who replaced Nonu after 57 minutes, crossed for Toulon's fourth try after fine bulldozing work by Paia'aua, Serin converting.
 And flanker Swan Rebbadj added some gloss for Toulon by muscling over for a fifth and final try in injury time after fielding a pinpoint crosskick by Serin, who also converted.
 "We didn't want to be the first team to lose at Agen," said Toulon coach Patrice Collazo.
 There was some consolation for rudderless Agen, however, with the post-match anouncement that Regis Sonnes will take over as head coach, aided by fellow former club players Jalil Narjissi (forwards) and Sylvain Mirande (backs).
 The trio has signed until 2022, according to president Jean-Francois Fonteneau, who assumed interim coaching responsibilities after the sackings of Christophe Laussucq and his assistant Remi Vaquin earlier this month.
 "All three of them have a link, a particular attachment to the club," said Fonteneau.
 "They are profiles that correspond to the identity and values of Agen rugby club."
 Fonteneau added: "I haven't lost hope of winning a match. That will be the mission of the new coaching team."
 Earlier in the day Toulouse beat Pau 22-16, a welcome first victory during the international window that has seen the team deprived of its players on Test duty.
 Antoine Hastoy scored all of Pau's points, thanks to a try, conversion and three penalties.
 Toulouse's sole try came from veteran France back Maxime Medard, Australian playmaker Zack Holmes making the difference as he hit the conversion and five penalties.
 Gaetan Germain kicked 19 points to help Bayonne notch up an impressive 29-20 home win over Montpellier.
 But Racing 92 left it late, scrambling to a 23-19 win away at Brive thanks to a last-minute Fabien Sanconnie try converted by Francois Trinh-Duc.
