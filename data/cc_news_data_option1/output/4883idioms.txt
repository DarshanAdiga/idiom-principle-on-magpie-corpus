If there's a plot to "Lovers Rock," it centers on Martha (Amarah-Jae St. Aubyn), the young woman we see at the film's beginning. She and her friend Patty (Shaniqua Okwok) meet at a nearby playground then make their way to the party, which is in full swing when they get there. McQueen, who wrote the script with Courttia Newland, has a keen eye for the subtle come-hither glances and furtive gestures of seduction: Eventually, Martha begins to dance with a charismatic stranger named Franklyn (Micheal Ward), and the night unfolds before them with the beckoning allure of the unknown.

Starting preseason in late May, the conflict with spring sports will be lessened but not eliminated, if spring sports stick to their traditional calendar. Baseball and lacrosse players would be in the latter portion of their regular seasons, preparing for playoffs that conclude the third Saturday in June. Track and field state meets are the first Saturday in June. Of course the spring sport calendar could be condensed but there is a strong sentiment to keep that season as intact as possible, since spring sports were already wiped out at the beginning of the pandemic.

"Maybe there's promising data with this vaccine, but you have to be honest with people," he said in a Friday interview. He also said he's worried about how alack of clarity could affect trust in other vaccines, as well as in AstraZeneca's.
 By Thursday, AstraZeneca had beat something of a retreat. Pascal Soriot, the company's CEO, told Bloomberg News that the company would further investigate the half-dose-full-dose regimen. He said he still expected to press forward with requests for regulatory approval in the UK and European Union.
 US authorization will have to wait for a trial currently underway in that country, Bloomberg reported. Morgan Stanley analysts said they expect that trial to deliver results later this year or early in 2021.
 ## 'There's something interesting here'
 In the long run, the mistake made by workers testing the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine could prove fortuitous if it reveals a better way to give the immunization, said Deborah Fuller, a microbiologist at the University of Washington who works on treatments and vaccines for viruses. But there's a need to investigate it more fully and understand the reasons behind it, she said.
 "Let's put the mistake aside and look at the data because there's something interesting here," she said.

Hiking close to home is one way to continue to safely explore and enjoy the outdoors, despite travel restrictions aimed at containing the COVID-19 pandemic. Locally, we have many parks, trails, and special areas for outdoor enthusiasts. Texas also boasts almost a hundred state parks, natural areas, monuments, and historic sites. In addition, two national parks in West Texas are just a long day’s drive from here. To deal with our own wanderlust, Bonnie and I decided to explore both the Big Bend and Guadalupe Mountains National Parks, camping in a small travel trailer.
 Big Bend National Park flanks the Rio Grande River at the tip of the horseshoe curve it makes winding south along the Texas-Mexico border before suddenly veering northward. This park boasts river, desert, and mountain ecosystems. More than 800,000 acres of land, resources, and history are protected here. Both the United States and Mexico are joined in an effort to preserve natural habitats upon which wildlife are dependent, irrespective of arbitrary political borders. Big Bend NP is also an important part of the bird migration route of South, Central, and North America.
 Many of the expansive landscape vistas belong to both nations. Santa Elena Canyon at the far western end of Big Bend NP is perhaps the best-known example of this. Hikers often take a short cut to the trails along the south wall of the canyon, overlooking the Chihuahua Desert of Mexico, by wading through the shallow Rio Grande. I chose instead to make a steep climb to the overlook trail without getting muddy and wet. On the eastern side of the park, Boquillas Canyon Overlook and a nature trail at the Rio Grande Village campgrounds where we stayed are excellent areas from which to access or view the Rio Grande and bordering landscapes. These are also excellent areas to catch sunsets against the stunning geologic shapes of the Sierra Del Carmen Mountain range.
