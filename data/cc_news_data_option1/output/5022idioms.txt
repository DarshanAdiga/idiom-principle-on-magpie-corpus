Generally, if you're young, employed, and financially stable, a market downturn presents a nice buying opportunity -- it's like a warehouse sale for investors who can afford to wait for a recovery. But if you're older, living paycheck to paycheck, sitting on a lot of debt, or uncertain about your job, you're wise to sit tight and do nothing after a crash. In that case, cash on hand serves you better than stocks, which may take their sweet time turning a profit for you.

“The stimulus and unemployment benefits have definitely helped the lower end of (credit card borrowers),” said Sanjay Sakhrani, an analyst at investment bank Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.
 As part of the $2 trillion coronavirus aid bill Congress enacted in March, most Americans got a $1,200 stimulus check. While the Census Bureau found that the bulk of Americans used their funds toward household expenses, roughly one out of five used it to pay down debt. Experts also argue that some household expenses would have ended up on credit cards were it not for stimulus checks and healthy unemployment benefits.
 In some ways, what’s going on in the credit card market also reflects the diverging fortunes of those impacted by the pandemic.
 Since the Great Recession more than 10 years ago, few mainstream credit card companies have put effort into lending to subprime borrowers or to the poor. Credit card companies are now focusing most of their attention on middle- to upper-class borrowers, who typically have jobs allowing them to work remotely and are not in businesses that have been shut down due to the virus.
 Even so, many middle-class individuals who do work in industries impacted by the pandemic have gotten financial relief through extended unemployment benefits or government and private programs that have allowed borrowers to enter into forbearance or deferred payment programs.
 “But those measures are now sunsetting, and (once they are gone, these borrowers) are most likely to be the first to feel pressure and pain,” said Sakhrani of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.

But there are simply not enough black STEM Ph.D.s to go around. In 2017, blacks made up 1.2 percent of all doctorates awarded in physics to U.S. citizens and permanent residents, according to the annual Survey of Earned Doctorates from the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics. Blacks earned 0.9 percent of all mathematics and statistics doctorates, 1 percent of all doctorates in computer science, 2 percent of all doctorates in chemistry, and 1.7 percent of all doctorates awarded in engineering disciplines. There were no black Ph.D. graduates in medical physics, atmospheric physics, chemical and physical oceanography, plasma/high-temperature physics, logic, number theory, robotics, or structural engineering. How academic STEM departments and Silicon Valley tech firms are going to fulfill their diversity pledges in light of that dearth of supply is a mystery. Yet in July 2020, MIT’s president blamed his own institution for not making headway on “racial equity and inclusion,” despite years of quota-izing effort. Virtually every other college leader has issued the same self-indictment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  *[FT]: Financial Times

"The Mayor did not experience any symptoms or test positive for COVID-19 until more than 48 hours after his return," the Trump campaign said, noting that "no legislators in any state or members of the press are on the contact tracing list, under current CDC Guidelines," which define "close contact" spending at least 15 minutes within six feet of an infected person within 48 hours of that person feeling ill.
 The World Health Organization has stated that people who are asymptomatic can still spread the virus.
 The decision to close Arizona's legislature comes as coronavirus cases in the state rise at a daunting rate. In the past week, reported cases grew 56 percent and reported deaths rose 80 percent, according to The Washington Post's coronavirus tracker. The positivity rate among reported tests in Arizona is nearly 30 percent, among the highest in the country.
 Arizona was the first stop on Giuliani's tour of states the Trump campaign says stole his victory by means of rampant voter fraud. State and federal officials, including allies of Trump, have repeatedly stated that there has been no evidence of such claims, and judges in six states — including Arizona, Georgia and Michigan — have ruled repeatedly that Trump's lawyers haven't proved that the election was fraudulent.
 The hotel event in Arizona on Nov. 30 included nine Republican lawmakers who sat on a panel to hear accounts from people who apparently witnessed votes being compromised, The Arizona Republic reported. Additional current and future GOP legislators sat in the audience.
 The next day, Giuliani held a private meeting with Arizona's GOP leadership, including state Senate Majority Leader Rick Gray, Senate President Karen Fann, House Speaker Rusty Bowers and House Majority Leader Warren Petersen, according to a tweet from state Sen. Vince Leach, who also attended the meeting. Leach posted an image of himself with his arm around Giuliani with neither wearing a mask.

BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Romania’s opposition Social Democrats bounced back from a series of corruption scandals to take a surprise lead in the country's parliamentary election. With 95% of ballots counted on Monday, the populist, left-leaning party won around 30% of the vote, leaving the governing National Liberal Party behind by around 5%. Neither party has a clear path to forming a new governing majority in Romania’s 465-seat bicameral parliament. The National Liberal leader, Prime Minister Ludovic Orban, said Monday that coalition talks with the Social Democrats were out of the question. But Orban did not provide a clear explanation for how his party hoped to reach a new governing majority in the 465-seat bicameral parliament.

"They certainly don't seem like a movie studio anymore," said another leading producer with ties to the studio, who declined to use his name.

The mean black score on the business school admissions test (GMAT) in 2017 was 453, on an 800-point scale. The average for whites was 565, for Asians 586, and the overall average was 549. Only 15 percent of black test takers scored 600 or higher in 2017, compared with 45 percent of whites and Asians. Sixty-six percent of black GMAT takers scored less than 500. In 2018, students entering the top ten business schools, as ranked by _The Economist_ , had average GMATs ranging from 690 to 732. The _Journal of Blacks in Education_ estimated in 2006 that only 1 percent to 2 percent of black GMAT takers scored above 700, a proportion that has not likely changed. A former Harvard Business School professor told the _Wall Street Journal_ in June that he had quit to protest the school’s systemic “antiblack practices.” An expectation of high-level quantitative skills was likely among those antiblack practices. Far from discriminating against blacks, the Harvard Business School admits at least twice as many black applicants as their average GMAT scores would predict. Nevertheless, Dean Nitin Nohria claims that the school’s efforts at racial justice have been “painfully insufficient.” California has now mandated minority representation on the boards of corporations headquartered in the state, regardless of whether the quota hires possess business expertise; other states will follow suit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  *[FT]: Financial Times

Police are preparing for more impaired drivers. The courts could see a deluge of requests for expungements of prior marijuana possession convictions.
 Prop 207 provides for neither defense.
 Prop 207 won a much larger victory – 1,946,440-1,302,458, or 60-40 percent, according to unofficial results – than President-elect Joe Biden did in the state.
 Although it legalizes possession of up to an ounce of marijuana, its full impact probably won’t hit home until April – when medical marijuana dispensaries will be able to sell weed to millions of new customers who won’t have to qualify for a medical marijuana card.
 Of course, it’s not as if those without a card couldn’t find marijuana in Arizona, a border state known for illegal drug trafficking.
 However, voter approval of the medical marijuana proposition in 2010 gave birth to a thriving industry.
 Through October, 287,715 residents with cards bought 2,786,197 ounces of marijuana from dispensaries this year alone, according to the Arizona Department of Health Services.
 Tom Dean, a defense attorney who specializes in marijuana cases, said he anticipates many people will not understand all the nuances in the new law.
 He said people may mistakenly believe they can buy recreational marijuana now.
 They can’t because no dispensary is authorized to sell it and likely won’t be until April and Dean thinks some people “are going to say, ‘screw that, I’m going to buy it from someone willing to sell it to me.’’
 Assuming the election results are certified tomorrow, the law will allow anyone over 21 to possess an ounce of marijuana legally and smoke it in their home.
 Since those without a card won’t find any place to buy it legally, Dean advises people to be patient and wait until April, when dispensaries are expected to have the green light to sell recreational weed.
 “I expect at least short term, there will be an increase until April or May’’ in black market sales, Dean said. “When there is demand, there is supply. This will cause a large increase in the black-market supply.’’
 Meanwhile, police are readying for more stoned drivers.
 Mesa police Officer George Chwe has spent the past year working with the Governor’s Office of Highway Safety, helping to establish a statewide standard for driving-under-influence investigations, which includes the influence of marijuana
 Mesa alone has 25 officers trained as Drug Recognition Experts and the state has added 50 more, bringing Arizona’s statewide total to 346.
 “I think we have a good head-start for this’’ law, Chwe said, noting more Mesa patrol officers are scheduled to receive additional training in how to spot marijuana-induced impairment.
 Chwe agreed with Dean that at least some people won’t want to wait and simply want to get high, fueling an increase in impaired driving.
 “It’s going to go up. People will think it’s okay to smoke marijuana and drive,’’ Chwe said. “People smoke marijuana for the feeling it gives them.
 “I tell them that feeling, because they feel different, they are going to drive different. If you drive different, you are impaired.’’
 Under the new law, simply driving with an illegal drug in your system law will no longer apply to marijuana.
 One major enforcement issue is the difference between arresting a driver high on alcohol and one high on weed.
 While drivers can be arrested for having a .08 blood alcohol level, there is no established number of nanograms of marijuana metabolite at which drivers are presumed impaired on weed.
 Officers must instead rely on their own observations of impaired driving and on an evaluation by a certified drug recognition expert.
 For marijuana consumers, the new law does come at a financial cost.

Arsenal were not outplayed at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium but rarely threatened Spurs, delivering a league-high 44 crosses into the area throughout the duration of the game but failing to find the target.
 It means the Gunners have now won just one of their last seven Premier League matches, while Arteta is coming under increasing pressure on the back of Arsenal's worst league start since 1981/82.
 For Arteta the salutation to Arsenal's problems is simple one: "By scoring goals. Very simple. We need to score goals. It is not sustainable.
 "It doesn't matter what we do in other departments if we don't score, we need to put the ball into the net urgently. At the moment it looks like we need a lot to score a goal.
 "In terms of the performance, they did everything that I asked them to do. We played the way we had to play this game. All the stats are in our favour, at the end of the day it is about putting the ball in the back of the net."

However, the envoys who called on the President yesterday (Sunday) at Jinja State Lodge in Jinja City, are said to have briefed him about the political situation in South Sudan and the way forward to the current standoff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The president reiterated to the envoys that the African problem is ideological, and advised them to focus on promoting the correct ideology of interests in the African countries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          “What our partners need to know is that many of the problems in Africa are ideological. You should therefore, focus on ideology because it is the real problem of Africa,” Mr Museveni is quoted as saying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          According to him, most Africans do not know that wealth comes from the four sectors of money, that’s, commercial agriculture, industries, services and ICT, adding that for them (Africans) think wealth can only be found in government jobs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          “Africa is 12 times the size of India and four times the size of USA. Our population is 1.3 billion people in Africa. We have a huge continent with a lot of resources. But for Africans, wealth only comes from government jobs,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          He advised the delegation to also go and meet President Salvar Kiir of South Sudan and Dr Riek Machar to have their sides of the story so that a way forward is sought to solve the South Sudan problem once and for all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          *[FT]: Financial Times

Ultimately, you want to tip the scale heavily in the positive direction. Sure, you’re going to say some negative things periodically. That’s just part of being human and being a triathlete who cares about your sport. You get tired, sick, and injured. You get frustrated, angry, depressed. The conditions get the better of you. So, you get down on yourself occasionally. But, when you tip the scales in the positive direction, you will find that, in contrast to the past, you are far more positive, you have much more confidence, and, most importantly, you are your best ally rather than your worst enemy in training and on race day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 *[FT]: Financial Times

“We were talking about issues that matter to people,” Kerans said about why she believes she was able to so far outraise her opponents. “We were talking about the pandemic and the economy and the other candidates were not. I think that was an important factor.”
 Kerans, who previously held the same seat in the House from 1991-97, added that she received a lot of support this time from friends and family in addition to new supporters.
 “They give because they know you and they think well of you, and they know you will put our heart and soul into it and work tirelessly for the people you represent,” she said.
 May said he found it “eye-opening” that Kerans received so many donations from donors across the country.
 Kerans reported receiving 194 donations from people in the district — Danvers, Peabody and Middleton — out of 393 total donations from within Massachusetts — more than all the other candidates. There were also 135 donations that came from out of state, campaign finance records show.
 May received 58 donations from residents in the district out of 112 from within Massachusetts, according to public records. He said his "grassroots campaign" was primarily funded by local donors who want to have a conservative voice on Beacon Hill.
 Guida, who raised more money than May but finished well behind him in votes, said he believed he was able to raise so much because he has been fortunate to meet and have positive interactions with people during his career as an attorney and in government.
 "The ray of light you take out of it, is you get to meet a lot of good people," Guida said, "and that so many people believed I would be a good candidate and state representative and were willing to support me. I really appreciate that."
 Over the course of the campaign season, Kerans spent $93,607 to May's $18,937. Guida, meanwhile, reported $25,684 in expenses, Bates $6,386, and Keohane just $65.
 Kerans, Guida and May said that because they campaigned during a pandemic, the majority of money spent went toward mailing flyers to voters, yard signs, door hangers and digital advertising.

Leading the charge in the Prairie girls’ basketball victory against the Lewiston JV on Nov. 24 was sophomore Tara Schlader, who fell just short of a rare triple-double performance with 20 points, 14 rebounds and nine steals.
 But she did not fall short of gaining recognition as the Tribune’s Prep Athlete of the Week.
 “She goes after every ball like it’s her last,” Prairie coach Lori Mader said of Schlader. “She is definitely well-driven, and always wanting to kind of fill in and do what you want. Has tons of desire, tons of determination, and just honestly never says ‘die.’”
 The 5-foot-9 post comes from a family of basketball players who introduced her to the game at a young age and keep her active “not just during the season, but during the offseason,” Mader noted.
 “I wanted to keep the (family) tradition going I guess,” Schlader said of her commitment to basketball. “I guess I’ve just continued to grow and love the sport as I’ve gotten older and started to understand it a little bit more.”
 Along with basketball, Schlader also plays volleyball and softball, and she is active in student chapters of BPA (Business Professionals of America) and HOSA (Health Occupation Students of America).
 As one might expect of a player with her pediwgree in a program with a history like that of Prairie, Schlader has her eyes set firmly on Idaho Class 1A Division I state glory this season.
 “It’s a tradition at our school that the girls make it to State, and I’d like to have a state championship under my belt,” she said.
 “I think everyone on our team is very qualified for that this year especially, so i think we should take advantage of that, and I think we could make it all the way.”

Miami was just one of four in their trips to the red zone and saw several possessions fizzle due to a vanilla approach — run early on and attempt a third-down fade along the perimeter. The Dolphins, playing an elite quarterback like Patrick Mahomes next week, can not trade touchdowns for field goals and expect to win. It's not possible or realistic. That's a similar script to the one we saw play out for the Dolphins in Week 4 in their 31-23 loss to the Seattle Seahawks. Miami flew close to the sun all game and cut the Seattle lead to 17-15 with just ten minutes remaining before things fell apart. They simply need to be better in the red zone.

“one positive of COVID taking away my sense of smell is changing my son’s diaper has become way less traumatic,” he tweeted.
 Also earlier in the day, the top-ranked Gonzaga Bulldogs hit the pause button on the program, forcing the postponement of several home games, including a nonconference affair Dec. 14 against Idaho.
 The Warriors (2-0), who are ranked No. 5 in the country in the NAIA preseason coaches top 25 poll, rolled to relatively easy victories at the Activity Center the previous two days against Yellowstone Christian. On Friday, three LCSC senior standouts — Travis Yenor, Damek Mitchell and Trystan Bradley, a Lewiston product — combined for 39 points as the Warriors bounced the Centurions 82-54.
 But that 28-point margin wasn’t good enough for LCSC, which came out Saturday and started the game on a 22-2 run, in a 98-49 throttling of ­Yellowstone Christian. All 13 players who played in the game for the Warriors saw seven or more minutes in the contest and every one of them scored.
 “Things haven’t been normal the past 12 months, so to have 40 minutes of some kind of normalcy for our players, to see them run around and smile, root for each other, make shots, miss shots and to see them kind of be 20-year-olds, it was really special,” Johnson said after Saturday’s game.
 The Warriors do not have any games scheduled on the horizon, and an athletic department spokeswoman said there will be no coaching adjustments at this time.
 The athletic department had no comment on if there are any more cases in the program, citing privacy laws.
 Just before the season originally was set to begin Nov. 6 against Yellowstone Christian in what was to be an exhibition game at that time, the team had some cases of the coronavirus. The college also was scheduled to play games Nov. 27 and 28 against Montana Tech and Montana Western at the Taco Bell Shootout at the College of Idaho in Caldwell, but those were nixed.
 Also, the women’s team previously had run into COVID-19 cases. The team was scheduled to visit Idaho on Nov. 25, but that game was canceled.
 This is all against the backdrop of two Cascade Conference members — Walla Walla and Evergreen State — deciding in November not to play basketball this season because of rising coronavirus cases in those areas. The conference is supposed to release a second revision of its schedule, which originally was an 18-game slate with a three-round conference tournament, in the near future. Now, at maximum, teams only will play 14 games with no conference tournament, and the top two teams will receive automatic bids into the NAIA national tournament, if it is contested.
 But LCSC certainly isn’t the only team in the region dealing with the coronavirus.
 The No. 1-ranked Zags were scheduled Saturday to play the second-ranked Baylor Bears in Indianapolis in what was supposed to be the game of the early portion of the season. However, one player and a member of the traveling party tested positive for COVID-19, and the teams, in consulation with the Indiana State Health Commissioner, the Marion County Public Health Director and both team physicians, decided it would be best to postpone the game.
 Not more than a day later, however, Gonzaga hit the pause button on the program.
 “We decided that this was in the best interest of our student-athletes,” athletic director Mike Roth said in a text message to the Spokesman-Review. “The health and safety of our players is our top priority. This decision was made with an abundance of caution in mind. This has been a very difficult decision, but we have all agreed that it’s the correct decision.”
 The Zags had home games scheduled against Tarleton State on Tuesday, Southern on Thursday, Northern Arizona on Saturday and Idaho on Dec. 14.
 There is the possibility that games could be rescheduled. The game against the Vandals might be the easiest one because the distance from Moscow to Spokane is about 85 miles.

Comprehensive neural and motor data from grasping experiments with two rhesus monkeys provided decisive results for the development of the model, which is an artificial neural network that, by feeding it with images showing certain objects, is able to simulate processes and interactions in the brain for the processing of this information. The neuronal data from the artificial network model were able to explain the complex biological data from the animal experiments and thus prove the validity of the functional model.This could be used in the long term for the development of better neuroprostheses, for example, to bridge the damaged nerve connection between brain and extremities in paraplegia and thus restore the transmission of movement commands from the brain to arms and legs (PNAS).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              *[FT]: Financial Times

The reason to eliminate standardized assessments is rather to put the College Board and the Educational Testing Service out of business entirely—and with them, any possibility of an objective measure of intellectual skills. The College Board was dealt a body blow this May when the University of California announced that it was ending the use of the SAT and the ACT in admissions for state residents. The SAT was a “racist test,” said the Vice Chair of the UC Regents, Cecilia Estolano. More than 1,000 colleges have already made the SAT optional or eliminated it entirely, but none has the financial clout of the University of California, the largest consumer of College Board products.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  *[FT]: Financial Times

Congress appears to be making progress toward an agreement on a new COVID-19 relief bill in the $1 trillion range. Additional unemployment benefits are likely, though it's unclear if Americans will see another round of stimulus checks.
 Credit card executives have for months been bracing for the impact on their customers if there is no new aid.
 “(Like our competitors), our customers are also helped by external factors such as the impact of record levels of government stimulus and the broad availability of forbearance programs,” said Jeff Campbell, American Express' chief financial officer, in October with a call with investors. “As a result, we do remain cautious about the potential for future shocks to the economy.”
 One point of uncertainty is how banks are reporting their credit card loans. The coronavirus aid bill and government regulators have required the industry to provide borrowers accommodations and relief without having to report these loans as troubled on their balance sheets, which accounting rules would otherwise require the banks to report as losses.
 In the absence of these programs and regulations, it's unclear whether delinquencies would be higher, at least on paper.

In 1789, the U.S. Constitution declared that seats in the U.S. House of Representatives would be allocated to the states in proportion to their populations. But it gave no guidance about how to fill those seats. Some states chose to draw an electoral district map, with each district getting one representative. Most of the others chose to grant the entire delegation to the party with the most votes statewide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     *[FT]: Financial Times

In that sense, the 1-0 victory, secured by Diop's scuttling finish past Fabien Barthez and a stunned French defence, was a moment of real emancipation. It also announced that Senegal team to the world, and laid the foundation for a strong run. Led by Frenchman Bruno Metsu, who excelled as a motivator and understood how to extract the maximum from every individual, the debutants held off challenges from Denmark, Uruguay and Sweden to claim a World Cup quarterfinal place for Africa for only the second time in history. Ultimately, it took an extra-time golden goal by Turkish forward Ilhan Mansiz to eliminate the West African side.

ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia’s governor is again telling lawmakers that he won’t call a special session to overturn Georgia’s election results and appoint 16 presidential electors who would support Republican President Donald Trump instead of Democratic President-elect Joe Biden.Republican Gov. Brian Kemp issued a joint statement Sunday with Republican Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, saying it would violate state law for the General Assembly to name electors instead of following the current state law that calls for the governor to certify electors after results are certified.“Any attempt by the legislature to retroactively change that process for the Nov. 3rd election would be unconstitutional and immediately enjoined by the courts, resulting in a long legal dispute and no short-term resolution,” the two said in their statement.Trump and Kemp spoke by phone hours before Trump held a rally on Saturday in Valdosta. The president asked Kemp to order the legislative session and the governor refused. According to a tweet from the governor, Trump also asked him to order an audit of absentee ballots from the presidential race in his state. Kemp has said he can’t do that because he has no authority to interfere in the electoral process on Trump’s behalf.Trump on Sunday tweeted more unproved allegations that Georgia’s election was fraudulent, blaming Kemp and Duncan for inaction.“Has anyone informed the so-called (says he has no power to do anything!) Governor @BrianKempGA &amp; his puppet Lt. Governor @GeoffDuncanGA, that they could easily solve this mess, &amp; WIN. Signature verification &amp; call a Special Session. So easy!”Duncan and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger appeared on television Sunday to defend the integrity of the election.“I’m proud that we’re able to look up after three recounts and watch and be able to see that this election was fair,” Duncan said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “Was it perfect? Absolutely not. I don’t know if any election was perfect in the history of this country.”“Right now, we don’t see anything that would overturn the will of the people here in Georgia,” Raffensperger said on ABC.Gabriel Sterling, who’s in charge of implementing Georgia’s voting system, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” Trump is inciting unrest.“The president’s statements are false. They’re disinformation. They are stoking anger and fear among his supporters. And hell, I voted for him. The situation’s getting much worse and it’s an environment that’s been built out over years,” Sterling said.State lawmakers could call a special session on their own, but only if 60% of members in both houses of the General Assembly demanded a session in writing. That’s unlikely, especially because more than 40% of the current members of the state House are Democrats.On Saturday, four Republican state senators including William Ligon of Brunswick, Greg Dolezal of Cumming, Brandon Beach of Alpharetta and Burt Jones of Jackson launched a written petition trying to collect the signatures to force a special session. All four attended Trump’s rally Saturday in Valdosta.“I don’t believe that there’s the will in the General Assembly for a special session,” Raffensperger said. He said if lawmakers went ahead “they would be then nullifying the will of the people.”Kemp and Duncan said that going to court is “the only viable — and quickest option” for people challenging the results of Georgia’s presidential balloting.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Jen (Christina Applegate) is an angry, terse, grieving widow. Judy (Linda Cardellini) is the spacy, sweet flake who killed Jen’s husband in a hit-and-run accident. Steve (James Marsden) is Judy’s late fiance. He was killed by Jen. And that’s just where Season 2 begins, unspooling a wonderfully twisted plot compelling enough to keep you from thinking about the horribly twisted reality outside your door. Created by Liz Feldman, the polar-opposite characters that drive this series should go down in history as one of television’s best odd couples.

On 2 December, a deportation flight organised by the Home Office took off to Jamaica. While the charter flight was initially planned to deport 50 UK residents with Jamaican heritage, only 13 men were on board when the plane took off. This second charter flight to Jamaica this year amid the second COVID wave sparked public outrage and protests. Last week, more than 80 Black public figures called on airlines who had previously been involved in deportations not to operate the flight. More than 60 MPs and peers signed a letter addressed to the Home Secretary urging to put hold on the removal plans amid the second wave. “If this charter flight goes ahead, children will be forced apart from their parents, and they may not even get a chance to say goodbye,” the letter stated. A petition urging to hold the flight was signed by over 185,000 people. The Home Office’s deportation plans were especially disputed in regards to the Windrush scandal and a number of legal challenges were launched, many of which succeeded, resulting in only 13 men being deported instead of 50. Home Office and Justice Minister, Chris Philip, commented in a tweet “It is disappointing that immigration law firms continued to use last minute tactics to remove a significant number of offenders from this flight.” Karen Doyle, from Movement for Justice, said: “While there are many families desperately relieved this morning, there are also many children who just lost their father before Christmas at a time of pandemic when children’s mental health is already suffering.”

The post-Covid pseudo-medical order has not only destroyed the medical paradigm I faithfully practised as a medical doctor last year. It has _inverted_ it. I do not recognise the government apocalypse in my medical reality. The breath-taking speed and ruthless efficiency with which the media- industrial complex have co-opted our medical wisdom, democracy and government to usher in this new medical order is a revolutionary act. A medical tyranny transitioning to a technocratic totalitarianism. A cis- to trans-medicine moment.

Roblox is on track to go public sometime this month with a listing on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "RBLX," and it's set to hit the market with a starting valuation in the range of $8 billion. The company's platform is posting eye-catching growth, and investors are eager to capitalize on the video game industry's momentum, so it wouldn't be surprising to see Roblox's valuation level up quickly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              *[FT]: Financial Times

SEATTLE (AP) — Alfred Morris scored a pair of third-quarter touchdowns, the New York defense shut down Russell Wilson and one of the top offenses in the league and the Giants stunned the Seattle Seahawks 17-12. The Giants were double-digit underdogs, and handed Seattle its first home loss of the season, sent the NFC West race into some unexpected mayhem and kept their spot on top of the NFC East for another week. New York began the season 0-5 but has won four straight and five of its past seven. Wilson threw one touchdown in the fourth quarter for Seattle but couldn't put together yet another comeback.

Similar to his iterating meditations on value, Mister E's mantra, "The show must go on," also rings more true than ever these days. "I think we can all agree it's been a fucking roller coaster," he says. "But, people like roller coasters, right? I think at the end of the day, it's made me focus more on putting a message in the art that I think people can relate to. And that makes people also look at life the way that I'm looking at it. One thing that we can't [do] is to go back in time. And that's why people say time is money--because time is much more valuable than money. You can't make it," he continues. "I never look backward because it's done. You can only look forward to have a positive attitude in life."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              *[FT]: Financial Times

Now most know that Donald Trump is not a Christian or even a religious man. So in exchange for the Christian Vote during the 2016 election he agreed to allow Mike Pence to control Middle Eastern foreign policy from behind the scenes. From the time President Trump and Vice President Pence were elected, the Christain Zionist agenda was used to influence Middle Eastern Foreign Policy. The first act that started this Christian Zionist agenda was the US pull out of the Iranian Nuclear Deal, and the reinstatement of full sanctions on Iran. Every other country that was a signatory on the Iranian Nuclear Deal was satisfied with the way progress was being made, except for the Trump Administration.

Instead of hiring models, hire the best long-legged poodles or labradoodles with colored fur, do a photoshoot and create a video. - Ally Spinu, USA Link System

Dylan’s songs have been recorded more than 6,000 times, by various artists from dozens of countries, cultures and music genres, including the Jimi Hendrix version of “All Along The Watchtower."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  *[FT]: Financial Times

NEW YORK (AP) — Bob Dylan’s entire catalog of songs, which reaches back 60 years, is being acquired by Universal Music Publishing Group. The catalog contains 600 song copyrights including “Blowin’ In The Wind,” “The Times They Are a-Changin’,” “Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door,” and “Tangled Up In Blue.”The influence of Dylan’s body of work may only be matched by that of the Beatles. Financial terms were not disclosed Monday. “Brilliant and moving, inspiring and beautiful, insightful and provocative, his songs are timeless—whether they were written more than half a century ago or yesterday,” said Sir Lucian Grainge, CEO of Universal Music Group, in a prepared statement. Dylan’s songs have been recorded more than 6,000 times, by various artists from dozens of countries, cultures and music genres, including the Jimi Hendrix version of “All Along The Watchtower.”The transaction’s announcement comes a few weeks after the singer-songwriter’s musings about anti-Semitism and unpublished song lyrics sold at auction for a total of $495,000.Dylan, first entered the public consciousness with New York City’s Greenwich Village folk scene during the early 1960s. When he brought an electric guitar on stage in 1965, he split the music community in what was considered a radical departure for an artist. Dylan then produced three albums back to back in just over a year that are changed the course of rock ‘n’ roll that decade, starting with “Bringing It All Back Home.”Dylan has sold more than 125 million records globally. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2016, the first songwriter to receive such a distinction. Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

"Another rapport-building asset he still had access to was an internal database with tens of thousands of references to literary and popular culture. As fast as he could he was pulling interrogation scenes and trying, on the fly, to build a model of how they worked. One thing he immediately understood was that interrogation relied on coercion, and frequently coercion meant violence. But that wasn’t a problem. Like regret, pain had been deemed detrimental to requirements by his designers. Even if they started hacking pieces off him he would simply lose capabilities until he eventually shut down. Maybe Blessing knew that, more likely she didn’t. In either case, it gave him something to work with."

WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) — Former Sen. Paul Sarbanes, who represented Maryland for 30 years in the Senate and helped write a landmark anti-fraud legislation and draft the first article of impeachment against Republican President Richard Nixon as a congressman, has died, his son said. He was 87.
 The Democrat “passed away peacefully this evening in Baltimore,” said a Sunday statement by Rep. John Sarbanes, who represents Maryland’s 3rd Congressional District.
 “Our family is grateful to know that we have the support of Marylanders who meant so much to him and whom he was honored to serve," the congressman said.
 His statement did not reveal the cause of Paul Sarbanes' death. His office did not immediately reply to questions from The Baltimore Sun.
 Sarbanes got into politics in 1966 with a successful run for Maryland's House of Delegates, then won a seat in Congress four years later. He earned a spot on the House Judiciary Committee, where he drafted the first article of impeachment against Republican President Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal, The Washington Post reported.
 After three terms in the House, he unseated Republican Sen. J. Glenn Beall, and would be reelected four times in a Senate career notable for his lack of flash. Republicans called him a “stealth senator,” a label Sarbanes embraced.

As I prepare for the end of the year and our City Council reorganization in San Mateo, I look back on this year in awe of the strength, resilience, and courage shown by our employees and residents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          It has been a year of unbelievable challenges. More than 4 million acres of wildfires, more than double any other year on record. We will not soon forget the dark days when smoke blocked out the sun and turned our fair city into a dystopian scene of the apocalypse. Our firefighters from San Mateo Consolidated and departments across the state stood shoulder to shoulder to fight the onslaught of fires with valor to save lives and homes. Brave heroes even during a pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We saw some of the businesses we love close temporarily and we saw some of them close for good. Whether it was the restaurant where we had our children’s birthday parties or our favorite watering hole, these businesses were entrenched into the tapestries of our lives. We will miss them dearly. Cities up and down the Peninsula have attempted to work with landlords and tenants, residential and commercial, to survive these scary and anxious months of shutdowns. Elected officials across the county stepped up to address our greatest challenges, in the face of critics from all sides, and addressing a pandemic with little data. I admire all the local leaders who inspired confidence during a time with much uncertainty, especially our County Manager Mike Callagy. Thank you Mike.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          This year, we lost inspiring leaders like Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Congressman John Lewis, and titans of our San Mateo community — Tom Mohr, Art Lempert and Greg St. Clair to name a few, in addition to incredible community members up and down the county. These losses hurt even more than they normally would because we simply have not been able to grieve in anything resembling a normal way. Their memory reminds us of the many servant leaders throughout our community. This pandemic must end. “Fondly do we hope — fervently do we pray — that this mighty scourge … may speedily pass away.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We cheered our health care workers at local hospitals on May the Fourth, but we must continue to carry them through this struggle. Their resilience will be a determining factor in our survival. We owe all of our essential workers — grocery workers, first responders, health care workers, teachers and more — a huge debt of gratitude. Don’t hesitate to thank them for their service; it’s free to you, but it’s worth a lot to them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          This year’s struggles have been a painful reminder of the deep disparities between parts of our community. Rich and poor, black and white, professionals and those who do physical labor. Billionaires have increased their wealth this year more than any time in recent history while unemployment is hitting record levels. The stock market is higher than it has ever been, yet the wealth gap between white America and black and brown America continues to grow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          It’s time for leadership to address social justice. It’s time for all of us to demand a recovery that eliminates disparities in health outcomes and supports our communities of color with opportunities — stable affordable housing, livable wages, health care and education. Every single one of these basic necessities is under threat. Until we commit to guarantee these basic necessities to every resident in every neighborhood, we are culpable in creating the disparities, and we must admit we are a part of the problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          All of that said, there is much that gives me hope. I am inspired by the overwhelming number of people who voted in this past election. Democracy is not a spectator sport; it’s a full contact participatory sport. We will always have differences — sometimes bitter differences — but we must find common ground. The elements that sow division are bad actors who profit from and exploit conflict. We must overcome the temptation to give in to their rhetoric.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          As President Lincoln said, “With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nation’s wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan — to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.” God bless San Mateo.

Wishing trees, or &quot;dilek ağacı&quot; as they are known in Turkish, can be spotted anywhere in Turkey, with the one outside the House of Virgin Mary in Şirince in western Izmir province one of the most memorable. This tradition comes from the times of pre-Islamic Turkic tribes. As shamans, the people of this era prayed to their Tengri (God) through the temples they built near trees, the source of life. They were known to make wishes to their creator through these trees and with time after Turks accepted Islam, this practice evolved into wishing trees. Nowadays, people mostly write their wishes on paper and hang them on these trees or tie a bandana or piece of fabric on the branches as they make a wish.",

The Pittsburgh Steelers, overall, have been one of the better offenses in the NFL in terms of executing in the red zone, coming away with a touchdown on a good percentage of their trips inside of the 20-yard line. That was at least until the Baltimore Ravens game last week, in which they stalled on their first three trips into that part of the field, though they did finally get into the end zone in the second half.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      *[FT]: Financial Times

Africa needs natural gas to light the way in both a literal and figurative sense. Our future is at stake, and we need to make our voices heard: We can curb emissions without cutting off a pathway to economic growth for the 20 African nations that have natural gas reserves. We can embrace clean energy without missing out on a critical means of giving more African households and businesses access to electricity. That’s a message we can’t let others drown out. The road to energy transition might be bumpy for all of us, but the idea of banning all fossil fuels makes it exceptionally treacherous, if not impassable, for Africa.

Under action taken over the weekend by the Newsom administration, the vast majority of Californians have been told to stay home until Dec. 28 and could still be there on New Year’s Day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    It’s the most sweeping state government directive since Newsom’s shutdown order on March 19, a response to a frightening surge in COVID-19 cases. And it’s been received with a mixture of fear, frustration and anger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    In particular, the rollout by the governor on Thursday seemed rough.

Many leaders have had a difficult time driving accountability in these challenging times. They have erred on the side of compassion and have shied away from candor. Letting your employees off the hook doesn't work for the business, and it frustrates you. Want to know a secret? It doesn't feel good to them either. The message you send when you don't acknowledge poor performance is that you have lowered your standards. Or worse, the employee might feel that you've lost confidence and have given up on them. Our thoughts go negative in the absence of communication. Reiterate goals and performance standards with your team regularly. Create opportunities for your team to connect with one another, celebrate the unique talents each person brings and reward results. Team-building activities are easier than ever with no travel and few materials required. A video-call service and a great facilitator can pack a powerful punch and motivate your team to crush goals once again. Celebrate successes, correct the misses, and you will create the momentum needed to ensure your team is on track to achieve great success.

Last week, Stevie Nicks sold her catalog in a reported $100 million deal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     *[FT]: Financial Times

This item arrived quickly and was a hit at the elf run my husband participated in this past holiday season. We made a couple of adjustments to help improve the effect of the elf/so it would look more believable. One thing that helped a lot was to safety pin the elf’s head up so that it would stand more upright, making it easier for people to make eye contact with the elf, thus selling the illusion better. Without this, the elf’s face looks downwards, which means people don’t make immediate eye contact with him, thus they wouldn’t notice the costume as easily. Also, we safety pinned the elf’s arms to the fake legs, to make the illusion that he was “holding” my husband over his shoulders look more convincing, especially as the fake legs flopped around a lot while he walked/ran. Lastly, as other commenters noted, out of the box, the suit is held onto its wearer via drawstrings. Since my husband was going to be running in this costume, we purchased a set of suspenders to help make it more secure- the last thing we would’ve wanted was for his costume to fall down in front of his coworkers. The suspenders worked worked perfectly and also added to the illusion of the costume. Overall, we were really happy with this purchase and it was a lot of fun. The construction of the piece was better than expected, and it didn’t get any noticeable damage during the entirety of the 5K run. The show covers didn’t trip my husband at all, and he was able to maintain a decent speed despite wearing this large constume over his pants.

In a speech given at the Migration Board at the Mediterranean Forum 2020 Maltese Minister of Foreign Affairs, Evarist Bartolo, stated that 2,256 ‘illegal immigrants’ have arrived to Malta in 2020. The Minister praised his country’s cooperation with war-torn Libya where widespread and extreme abuse and human rights violations are well documented, stating: "Had it not been for the good relations and strong cooperation with Libya, some 7,000 others who were intercepted would have arrived at the shores of the country." According to Special Envoy of the UNHCR for the Central Mediterranean situation, Vincent Cochetel, the Minister further mentioned that a survey in Malta suggested that 45% of the respondents think that we should let migrants and refugees drown.

LOS ANGELES - California compelled much of the state to close shop and stay at home on Monday, when some of the harshest coronavirus restrictions in the United States came into effect one day after the state set a record with more than 30,000 new COVID-19 cases.
 Governor Gavin Newsom's order was triggered in areas where fewer than 15 percent of intensive care hospital beds were available, affecting more than 23 million people in Southern California.
 In addition five counties in Northern California surrounding the San Francisco Bay area have voluntarily imposed the restrictions even before reaching the ICU threshold.
 California has been under a stay-at-home order for all but essential services since March. The new order, which will last at least three weeks, bans private gatherings of any size, shuts all but critical infrastructure and retail operations, and requires everyone to wear a mask and maintain physical distancing.
 Newsom, a first-term Democrat, has threatened to withhold funds from local governments that refuse to comply.
 Even so, the sheriffs of Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside counties have said they will refuse to enforce the order, emboldening non-essential businesses to remain open.
 Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco said in a videotaped message posted on the department's website that his office "will not be blackmailed, bullied or used as muscle" to enforce the governor's orders.
 "Orange County Sheriff's deputies will not be dispatched to, or respond to, calls for service to enforce compliance with face coverings, social gatherings or stay at home orders," his counterpart in Orange County, Don Barnes, said in a written statement.
 Even so, the mayor of one Los Angeles County town said more enforcement was needed.
 "People absolutely should be arrested for not wearing masks," Lancaster Mayor R. Rex Perris told the Orange County Register. "Most of these people have never been arrested before. Spend one night incarcerated and they won't do it again."
 California reported more than 30,000 new cases on Sunday, exceeding the state's previous high of 21,986 set on Dec. 4, and marked a new record for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
 New Jersey, North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia also announced record one-day rises in new infections.
 Nationwide, COVID-19 infections in United States are at their peak with an average of 193,863 new cases reported each day over the past week, according to a Reuters tally of official data.
 There have been 14.7 million infections and 282,253 coronavirus-related deaths reported in the country since the pandemic began.
 States are grappling with how to respond to the global pandemic in the absence of a national strategy.
 Departing President Donald Trump, a Republican, has downplayed public health measures such as mask-wearing, instead banking on the rapid development of vaccines, which could receive federal approval this month.
 President-elect Joe Biden, a Democrat, has said he will make the pandemic his top priority upon taking office on Jan. 20.
 One of the president's own aides on Sunday criticized leaders who have undermined the prevailing medical science.
 Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House's coronavirus response coordinator, has come under fire for failing to speak out against the country's shortcomings on the pandemic. But she told the NBC News program "Meet the Press" on Sunday that it was "frustrating" to see governors and mayors give up on measures that proved effective in slowing the virus in the spring.
 "I hear community members parroting back those situations, parroting back that masks don't work, parroting back that we should work towards herd immunity, parroting back that gatherings don't result in super-spreading events," Birx said.
 Attempting to set the record straight, she said, "You cannot gather without masks in any indoor or close outdoor situation."

BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Romania’s opposition Social Democrats have taken a surprise lead over the governing National Liberals after a parliamentary election but appear less likely to emerge on top in what promises to be prolonged post-election wrangling to form a new coalition government.
 With 95% of ballots counted Monday, the populist, corruption-prone and fiscally reckless Social Democrat Party (PSD) had around 30% of the vote, with the reformist center-right National Liberal Party trailing them by about 5%. The progressive USR-Plus alliance, which has pledged not to be part of any Social Democrat-led government, won about 15% of the vote.
 Only two other parties crossed the 5% threshold to enter Parliament: the far- right AUR alliance, whose vocal opposition to coronavirus restrictions resonated with close to 9% percent of voters, and the UDMR party that represents the country's Hungarian minority, which won around 6%.
 The National Liberal leader, Prime Minister Ludovic Orban, said Monday that coalition talks with the Social Democrats were out of the question but did not provide a clear explanation for how his party hoped to reach a new governing majority in the 465-seat bicameral parliament.
 “I want to be very clear, we will never negotiate with the PSD, we will not let the PSD harm Romania,” Orban said.
 The AUR alliance was established just a year ago under the leadership that militates against same-sex marriages and was supportive of Orthodox Church clerics who defied pandemic restrictions in Romania to hold religious ceremonies. But it did surprisingly well among Romania’s expats, having taken the lead in Italy and coming in second in Spain and France.

As ever, I do not like the definitive word “best” when it comes to such list-making, though I will swear on a stack of TV Guides to the high quality of these shows. It’s more than a matter of comparing apples and oranges — television is also grapes and carrots and cheese and potatoes. These are just to my taste. Some were pleasurable in unexpected ways; others fulfilled expectations with skill and, if I can get a little mushy here, heart. What they do share is a sense of possibility and characters out to better themselves and/or to change the world; these are the cords that link “City So Real” to “The Great” and “Betty” to “The Queen’s Gambit.” (There is also, I note, a wealth of self-actualizing women among them.) And most are funny, even when they aren’t strictly speaking comedies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         *[FT]: Financial Times

The defense notched its first shutout of a conference foe since 2001, forced five turnovers and held Duke to just 177 yards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     It was as good as it has gotten for the coach in his two years at the helm, but he also wants to provide a hopeful reminder: It's going to get even better."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     "This is just the launching point," Diaz said in his weekly appearance on WQAM's "The Joe Rose Show with Zach Krantz." "This is not as good as it's going to get and I think our players understand that, as well. We want to finish strong this year and then kick into a true, proper offseason, and really continue to improve on what we do and how we do it."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     With two games left in the regular season, the Hurricanes (8-1, 7-1 Atlantic Coast) have a chance to finish the regular season with 10 wins for the first time since 2017 and a chance to win 11 games for the first time since 2003. While No. 9 Miami was eliminated from ACC Championship Game contention Saturday, the Hurricanes are still in position to reach a New Year's Six bowl game for the first time since 2017 as the No. 10 team in the College Football Playoff rankings.

The whole system, as Berkeley professor Mike Eisen explained in a recent interview in _Science_ , “was built for the printing press.” When journals had to print everything on paper and ship the journals to libraries around the world, it kind of made sense. They were providing a valuable service for science, and it does cost money to print and deliver all those journals.

Then, the second torpedo hit and the ship began to list and capsize.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     *[FT]: Financial Times

It's "very flattering," Fauci said. "Probably a more realistic assessment is that, rather than the Fauci Effect, it's the effect of a physician who is trying to and hopefully succeeding in having an important impact on an individual's health, as well as on global health. So if it works to get more young individuals into medical school, go ahead and use my name. Be my guest."
 Among other reasons admissions officials cite for the increase in prospective medical students is that the pandemic has given people more free time to complete the arduous application process.
 "A lot of the plans they made postgrad honestly fell through," said Sahil Mehta, a practicing radiologist and founder of MedSchoolCoach, which prepares students for the Medical College Admission Test, or MCAT.
 When the dermatology practice where she was working as a medical assistant shut down temporarily because of COVID, Mary Grace Kelley had the chance to retake the MCAT and improved her score.
 "This is a perfect time of no distractions," said Kelley, 23, who lives in the Boston suburbs and is applying to medical schools this year.
 The deluge of applications comes as the nation faces a projected shortage of physicians.

Now, the bad news. Unless you have been under a rock, you know that the country has largely not followed the CDC guidelines regarding mask wearing and staying at least 6 feet apart most of the time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          While more people are wearing masks, we have never reached anywhere near 95 percent compliance with this basic request. We still don’t know how many viral particles it takes to produce infection with the COVID-19 virus, and we probably never will, because there are so many variables. We know that many who are infected are able to spread the virus before they have symptoms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Some asymptomatic spreaders appear to spread more viral particles than others. And each exposed individual has unique resistance and/or vulnerabilities to becoming infected. What is clear is that more time in close proximity to a person with the virus increases risk of spread.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          So, can we or should we relax and let our guard down while we wait for the vaccination? Absolutely _not_.

And we have not yet seen the effects of the return of college students to their homes over Thanksgiving or the increased pressure to gather in groups for the holidays. Or the lower temperatures and drier air of winter that make outdoor gatherings more difficult and viral particles more prone to stay airborne longer.

Graduate programs have been dropping the GREs because of their disparate impact. Half of all physics and astronomy departments, and nearly as many molecular biology and neuroscience programs, no longer require them. Cornell’s department of biomedical engineering, known for its diversity advocacy, and the University of Michigan’s biomedical sciences program have eliminated them. At the University of California, San Diego, the computer science and engineering, bioengineering, and nanoengineering programs are eliminating or waiving the GREs. UC San Diego’s graduate division dean recommended in July 2020 that the rest of the school’s graduate programs follow suit. Harvard and Caltech’s physics departments suspended the general GRE and the physics subject test in 2020, citing coronavirus concerns; they will likely not reinstate them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  *[FT]: Financial Times

Yet diplomacy is often preceded by bluster.

Retaliation for the death of Soleimani was limited to a strike on the US military base in Iraq, al-Asad, in which no US troops were killed. Iran's hardliners feel retaliation is already overdue.

In 1789, the U.S. Constitution declared that seats in the U.S. House of Representatives would be allocated to the states in proportion to their populations. But it gave no guidance about how to fill those seats. Some states chose to draw an electoral district map, with each district getting one representative. Most of the others chose to grant the entire delegation to the party with the most votes statewide.

Students in the Life Skills program at Lewiston High School received an adaptive tricycle last week that will give kids a fun activity while providing a therapeutic element.
 The tricycle helps special education students in the program with their balance, coordination and muscle memory skills.
 “In some capacity or another, I would say 95 percent of the students can use it, maybe even more than that,” said life skills teacher Robin Stone of the 22 kids in the program. “I just think it’s amazing, and I’m so happy we were able to get this.”
 The trike, which was requested by the school district’s occupational therapist, Tim Gundy, was purchased by the Green Apple Project through its grant process. The organization provides autism support, education and awareness to the Lewiston-Clarkston Valley and beyond.
 “We have really fantastic students out here, and their parents are awfully supportive and are always looking for new activities that they can have their students do,” Gundy said. “This (idea for an adaptive tricycle) was actually presented to me by a parent.”
 Students in the life skills program were able to test out a loaner tricycle that belonged to another student. It quickly became a popular activity the kids looked forward to.
 “Some of the students had never been on wheeled mobility before, and just the expressions of joy we saw when we got it outside for the first time was great,” Gundy said. “There’s therapeutic value like balance and coordination, but beyond that having a leisure activity gives the kids something to look forward to.”
 Laura Lumley, executive director of the Green Apple Project, said use of the tricycle spurrs kids to more actively participate in their physical, occupational and speech therapies.
 Gundy agreed and said students on the autism spectrum who utilize the trike often respond with better eye contact and more verbalizations.
 It has also given students outside of the program an opportunity to connect with the Life Skills students.
 “The kids were riding it along, and the general population at the high school was fascinated by the trike as well,” Lumley said. “It made the kids in the Life Skills class feel like part of their community, and in the long run I think we’ll help reduce the bullying that happens with kids who are a little different because it gives them a common thread and something to talk about.”
 Gundy said this is the first adaptive tricycle the district has received. He said the new piece of equipment allows students to have “fun, fitness and freedom.”
 “This is a lifetime activity, and we’ve got some students right now in the classroom that will graduate from this type of a more adaptive piece of mobility to something like recumbent cyclists you see on our bike paths,” he said.
 He hopes to get more trikes in the future and envisions creating a club, so the students in the program can socialize more.
 “In the summertime, some of our students can get together with their parents, family and guardians and go triking together,” Gundy said. “That’s something we are going to look into and see if we can get going.”
 The adaptive tricycle was presented to school staff and administrators outside of the main entrance to Lewiston High School last week.
 The life skills program teaches kids subjects like English, math and history, while also focusing on independent skills, social skills and functional communication.
 The Green Apple Project provides grants or scholarships to students with an official or suspected developmental disability to help fill unmet needs. To learn more, those interested can go online to www.greenappleproject.org.

However, if you only focus on hiring people with an industry background, you end up with a “faster horses” problem. These people might be great at improving or automating a bank’s processes, but that isn’t going to create true innovation or disrupt an industry. At some point, it’s not about faster horses; it’s about inventing a car. To do that, you need to hire people who can think outside the box and help you see old problems in a new way — not to mention folks with technical talent and the right attitude. Once you strike the right balance of people on your team, vertical growth won’t be far behind.

NEW YORK (AP) — Bob Dylan’s entire catalog of songs, which reaches back 60 years is being acquired by Universal Music Publishing Group.
 The catalog contains 600 song copyrights including “Blowin’ In The Wind,” “The Times They Are a-Changin’,” “Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door,” and “Tangled Up In Blue."
 The influence of Dylan's body of work may only be matched by that of the Beatles.
 Financial terms were not disclosed Monday.
 “Brilliant and moving, inspiring and beautiful, insightful and provocative, his songs are timeless—whether they were written more than half a century ago or yesterday," said Sir Lucian Grainge, CEO of Universal Music Group, in a prepared statement.
 Dylan’s songs have been recorded more than 6,000 times, by various artists from dozens of countries, cultures and music genres, including the Jimi Hendrix version of “All Along The Watchtower."
 The transaction's announcement comes a few weeks after the singer-songwriter’s musings about anti-Semitism and unpublished song lyrics sold at auction for a total of $495,000.

In 1789, the U.S. Constitution declared that seats in the U.S. House of Representatives would be allocated to the states in proportion to their populations. But it gave no guidance about how to fill those seats. Some states chose to draw an electoral district map, with each district getting one representative. Most of the others chose to grant the entire delegation to the party with the most votes statewide.

Even in a pandemic year, when Hollywood was forced to take it slow, there were more great new television series than will fit into this traditionally tight year-end space, into whose 10 slots I have already stuffed 12 shows. Except for a coronavirus line inserted into the closing seconds of, all places, a “Saved by the Bell” reboot and the last act of a documentary about Chicago politics, the pandemic itself is not portrayed in any of these choices yet it is somehow felt in all of them, from a sense of difference, or of absence, whenever someone shakes hands or hugs or hangs out in a bar or — what I find especially triggering — goes in somewhere for coffee.

The virus has killed more than 282,000 people in the United States, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              *[FT]: Financial Times

In 1789, the U.S. Constitution declared that seats in the U.S. House of Representatives would be allocated to the states in proportion to their populations. But it gave no guidance about how to fill those seats. Some states chose to draw an electoral district map, with each district getting one representative. Most of the others chose to grant the entire delegation to the party with the most votes statewide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             *[FT]: Financial Times

Companies’ self-initiated diversity goals are no less sweeping. Half of Facebook’s workforce will come from “underrepresented communities” (i.e., black and Hispanic) by 2023, according to Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg—a remarkably ambitious pledge in light of Facebook’s current 3.8 percent black workforce.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  *[FT]: Financial Times

JOHANNESBURG - Government has launched a R1 billion presidential employment stimulus for subsistence producers.
 Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development Minister Thoko Didiza told reporters at a briefing in Pretoria that more than 75 people - mainly women whose production was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic - would benefit from the programme.
 Each participant will receive between R1,000 and R9,000 while others will receive farming input vouchers to retain self-employment in the sector and support food value chains.
 “Specific targeted communities that will be supported we’ll take into consideration the agricultural calendar year in line with the commodities that are produced in that season, including livestock,” said Didiza.
 "Subsistence farmers must note that the time and quantities of support provided will be limited to the commodities applied for and the size of the current operation which would have been verified.”

“We need to make sure that we are getting good sleep,  that we are exercising to move the stress out of our bodies. That we are asking for help. That we all deserve to ask and receive help.

Her only criticism is that her server (me) hadn’t provided her with a spoon for her peas, so back off to the kitchen I went for that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Although we ordered the smaller portion, this was a generous serving, with crispy beer battered east coast haddock, chunky chips, peas, tartare sauce and a wedge of lemon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     _Chocolate brownie_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The filling of Phil’s pie was still piping hot, which took him by surprise. The puff pastry was still nice and crisp too. He said the beef was tender and the gravy in the pie and provided on the side was full of flavour. The fluffy mash had a hint of horseradish.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      My rolled fillet of plaice was cooked perfectly, and worked really well with the smoked salmon inside. It was served with buttered new potatoes and greens – cabbage, leek, green beans – and the most moreish, buttery watercress veloute, of which I used every last drop.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     None of us could finish our mains – I think I’d order a smaller portion for myself next time – and had to wait a little while before trying the puddings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Jessica tried a little bit of the chocolate brownie, which was served with chocolate sauce. She scraped the bowl clean and had chocolate everywhere afterwards. I tried a bit too, it was rich and gooey, just as a brownie should be.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     _Apple crumble_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Phil tried the apple crumble, which came with a pot of custard. The apples were not too sweet, while the topping was crispy and the custard nice and creamy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I think the highlight of the entire meal was the chocolate brioche and butter pudding. Buttery, squidgy, with layers of rich dark chocolate, this beauty was topped with sugar and went really well with the smooth custard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The good news for everyone is that the Woolpack is open to diners from today now that lockdown has ended, but they will also continue offering takeaway for collection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    So whether you fancy Friday night fish and chips or a Sunday roast (yes they serve those too – with giant Yorkshires), you can eat in or takeaway. And don’t forget to order one of the stunning puddings too.

Human rights organisations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have repeatedly condemned the conditions and called for transferring people to safe reception facilities. Juan Carlos Lorenzo from ECRE member Comisión Española de Ayuda al Refugiado (CEAR) stressed that the dismantling of the Arguineguín pier should not be seen as a “victory” but that instead the camp should never have existed in the first place. The organisation calls for six steps to address the “humanitarian drama” unfolding in the Canary Islands, including guaranteed access to asylum procedures, reactivating periodic and systematic transfers to the Spanish peninsula, and territorial solidarity based on a distribution system. Spain’s government refuses transfers to the mainland and has resumed returns to Algeria, Morocco and Mauretania.

"It's no secret that the art of songwriting is the fundamental key to all great music, nor is it a secret that Bob is one of the very greatest practitioners of that art," added Sir Lucian Grainge, the CEO of Universal Music Group. "Brilliant and moving, inspiring and beautiful, insightful and provocative, his songs are timeless—whether they were written more than half a century ago or yesterday."

Dodgers complete late inning comeback to take game one against the Phillies!

Having started the final day of the 15th Tusker Malt Lager Uganda Professionals Open with a seven-stroke lead, it was always going to take a collapse of gigantic proportions for Zimbabwean Robson Chinhoi not to lift the ‘Holy Grail’ of the Shs100m money-spinning event.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          After rounds of 71, 66 and 69, the bubbly Chinhoi was unbelievably 10-under for tournament - scores only comparable to the bigger leagues like Professional Golf Tour (PGA).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           His closest challenger - the spirited Phillip Kasozi of Uganda - was three-under for the tournament – whereas the celebrated Deo Akope was two-under.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          And with a gallery, in hundreds, swarming the par-72 Kitante course yesterday with some Dutch courage hoping that a Ugandan could spring a surprise, Chinhoi cast any such thoughts quickly out of the window.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          *[FT]: Financial Times

The cost made me afraid to go before that. I'm too young for insurance to actually cover anything short of life-threatening, so last time I had an ear infection (and to be fair it was a very severe one) I spent $2000 out of pocket for not much more than people looking in my ears a few times and writing prescriptions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     *[FT]: Financial Times

President Museveni Sunday said he will continue pushing for elections in the neighboring South Sudan on grounds that it will help solve their political problems “once and for all.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          According to Mr Museveni, elections will force political players in the African youngest nation to form alliances like it was in Kenya and that this will in turn create unity and peace in South Sudan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            “The real medicine to the South Sudan problem is elections. This same problem was in Kenya but was managed when they formed alliances and later held elections. Me I want to push them (South Sudan) to elections. If South Sudan can do the Kenyan way, elections will force them to make alliances and this problem will be history,” Mr Museveni told the United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK) Special Envoys to Uganda who met him at Jinja State Lodge on Sunday.

I urge all Federal agencies and interested organizations, groups, and individuals to fly the flag of the United States at half-staff in honor of those American patriots who died as a result of their service at Pearl Harbor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             *[FT]: Financial Times

Having a plan keeps you grounded in the face of bear markets and stock market freefalls. When rage, frustration, or disappointment beg you to sell out and cut your losses, your plan is the gentle voice of reason. It stifles that self-defeating conclusion that you don't know what to do next or how you'll ever recover. You know exactly what to do, because you thought through the crash scenario before your head was filled with all those crazy emotions.

The myth of bias, whether in medicine, technology, or finance, can be maintained only by ignoring the skills gap. There simply are not enough competitively qualified black candidates to go around. Moreover, one-third of all black males have a felony conviction. Such convictions do not happen by chance; they signal involvement with the street culture of guns, drugs, and impulsivity, none of which is a selling point to employers. The prevalence of out-of-wedlock births in the black community (over 69 percent of all births) means that a high percentage of black females are burdened with solo child-rearing responsibilities. Such responsibilities make advancement more difficult, no matter the amount of employer paid leave.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  *[FT]: Financial Times

Another rapport-building asset he still had access to was an internal database with tens of thousands of references to literary and popular culture. As fast as he could he was pulling interrogation scenes and trying, on the fly, to build a model of how they worked. One thing he immediately understood was that interrogation relied on coercion, and frequently coercion meant violence. But that wasn’t a problem. Like regret, pain had been deemed detrimental to requirements by his designers. Even if they started hacking pieces off him he would simply lose capabilities until he eventually shut down. Maybe Blessing knew that, more likely she didn’t. In either case, it gave him something to work with.

Your employees are looking to you and other leadership to understand what is appropriate. If you appear to be close-minded or insist on doing it all yourself, executives and employees will follow suit. Ineffective leadership can very quickly negatively impact productivity, morale and eventually the bottom line.

Transmission duties are handled by a five-speed manual gearbox as standard on both powertrains, however, the turbo petrol unit also comes with an optional CVT automatic unit which offers slightly less torque at 152 Nm.

Since the Great Recession more than 10 years ago, few mainstream credit card companies have put effort into lending to subprime borrowers or to the poor. Credit card companies are now focusing most of their attention on middle- to upper-class borrowers, who typically have jobs allowing them to work remotely and are not in businesses that have been shut down due to the virus.

The achieving phase can last for years or decades before this next phase appears. In the deceiving phase, the achiever has begun to experience feelings of doubt and discontent around their strive-and-drive operating system. Even still, they dismiss or diminish their feelings and will talk themselves out of exploring what’s really going on at a spiritual level or making any changes because they fear the loss of love that might result from making changes. Often they experience guilt, shame, self-judgment or self-criticism for even having the thoughts in the first place. Once the deceiving phase shows up for the first time, it tends to linger for a while, sometimes even months or years, although it may become dormant and only show up as active thoughts infrequently and every once in a while.

It's just glory to God."

"I joke with him a lot about it," Heat forward Andre Iguodala said of Adebayo's new max extension. "I can hopefully get a loan from him one day. Not that I need it. But if I don't bring any cash and I need a vegan burger or plant based burger, he would give me a couple dollars so I can eat. So I can lean on him now, that's my go-to guy.

Sensors answer many important questions such as how well-inflated are a car's tires, whether ice is building up on an airplane's wings, whether carbon monoxide is in the air and how much oxygen is in your blood.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             *[FT]: Financial Times

If we go by the diagram, the 600-megapixel module will be 22mm thick and will cover a large area on the back of the phone. Most phones we use today are under 10mm thick, so Samsung might not be ready to use this sensor in its current iteration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              *[FT]: Financial Times

As the Chamber has stated, we are all for a diversified energy mix and are looking forward to seeing cleaner energy developments surface across the continent. Currently, however, solar and wind projects rely on global value chains, which limits their ability to support local jobs, business opportunities, and capacity building. Until this can be resolved, the renewable energy industry simply cannot offer Africa the same value as a strategic approach to our oil and gas industry. Natural gas production is particularly important, not only because of the role it can play in alleviating energy poverty, but also because of its potential to be monetized, to facilitate infrastructure development, and to foster the creation and strengthening of other sectors. And that, in turn, can lead to even more jobs, business opportunities, and economic growth for African communities.

In his Chronicle interview, Brown expanded his critique to include single- payer healthcare activists, the "defund the police" movement and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's "squad" of progressive women leaders. All of these kids should get high, and get off of Biden's lawn.
 Brown gets a few things right. Conservative swing-state voters hold sway in national politics, making progressive policy wins hard for leaders like Biden. It's a grim reality, but progressive goals will be impossible to achieve if Republicans keep the Senate or take back the House.
 In addition, when a slogan repels most voters -- as "defund the police" does -- it's wise to find better words. That's Politics 101.
 But Brown's general antipathy toward activists misses the mark. Activists play a crucial role in our politics. They serve as countervailing powers that prevent powerful interests and corporate lobbyists from controlling everything. True, they sometimes push leaders and systems past their comfort zones. That's part of the process. By demanding what seems impossible you get more of what is possible.
 Think where society would be today if the abolitionists, the suffragists or the Freedom Riders had taken chill pills and instead of taking a stand. A pot- fueled anti-war movement helped shift public opinion against the Vietnam War. Today, radical activists continue to agitate against the death penalty and nuclear weapons -- two causes close to Brown's heart. Should they turn on, tune in and drop out?
 Back to weed: Brown has a strange impression of marijuana. It's based on the outdated stereotype of indolent and apathetic "potheads." In reality, today's stoners come from all walks of life. Many wear suits, excel in athletics or hold demanding jobs. Some work in government and -- I won't name names -- a few have worked for Brown.
 Some people even credit certain marijuana strains with helping increase their energy, focus, health and creativity. In July, with social unrest and protests peaking, California cannabis sales hit a record monthly high of $348 million, according to Marijuana Business Daily.
 One rarely sees a protest without pot plumes. Should activists smoke more grass?
 "Always a good idea!" one veteran hippie activist in his late 60s told me.
 Perhaps Brown should rethink his prescription. Or maybe he should take his own advice, turn over a new leaf and spark fresh consciousness in his formidable brain.

In this phase, the individual begins to feel deeply reconnected to passion and inspiration. They can feel they are in the flow and momentum of co-creation and start to experience synchronicities and a sense that "everything's falling into place," which then lends itself to a type of strength and boldness as faith replaces fear. Action happens naturally and without a great deal of effort, and the focus is on the journey instead of the destination. This phase can continue for as long as the achiever resists the urge to "figure it out" and control the outcome. If the achiever lingers too long in the "how do I...?" conundrum, they will find themselves back at phase one.

There are reasons we watch certain movies and it has a lot to do with the fact that they're made to look as impressive as possible with the choreography and the action that pulls people in. The drama that a boxing movie includes is often seen as filler by a lot of people since the matches are usually the best parts, though some might want to disagree. But the fact is that movies do get a lot of things wrong about boxing since, as I mentioned, they're attempting to tell a story and make it look as glamorous as possible, or as realistic, and a lot of times they go a little too over the top and add in too much or too little detail when it comes to the actual match. The point in a movie is to look good, not to get everything accurate, but the unfortunate part is that when things look too good then it doesn't come out feeling real since if anyone's ever watched a real boxing match things aren't quite as smooth as they appear in the movies and the boxers aren't bound to look as good in the act. Like a lot of things in life, a boxing match is rough and kind of hard to watch at times since it takes time to get into a rhythm.

Tanzania: Simba to Lock Horns With FC Platinum in CAF Competition


--DocBreak--
Bloomberg) -- Exports of gems and jewelry from India, which polishes about 90% of the world’s rough diamonds, showed a sharp recovery in November, providing relief to an industry battered by the coronavirus pandemic.
 Overseas shipments fell about 4% from a year earlier to $2.48 billion, compared with a 99% plunge at the start of the financial year in April, according to Colin Shah, chairman of the Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council. It was also milder than the 19% to 40% decline in the prior three months.
 India imposed one of the world’s strictest lockdowns in March to contain the virus outbreak and the measures to control the pandemic meant jewelry and diamond-cutting production centers were either closed or operating at very low levels.
 Diamond Powerhouse Says This Slump Is Much Worse Than 2008
 However, from November, as many as 90% of the industry’s workers have come back as business has recovered in the key manufacturing cities of Surat, Jaipur and Mumbai, Shah said.
 Still, “the industry is not out of the woods” and business is expected to come back to normal or pre-Covid level only once there is a successful vaccine in place, he said. The Indian government needs to reduce import taxes on cut and polished diamonds and precious metals to aid the recovery, he added.
 Exports during April to November were 44% lower at $11.43 billion, and India may ship as much as $9 billion over the remaining months of the financial year, he said. That would result in exports for the year falling by as much as 31% from a year ago.

The plan breaks a tradition of lame-duck presidents deferring to incoming presidents on policy about which they differ so starkly, said Robert Durham, director of the non-partisan Death Penalty Information Center.

None of the scientists I spoke to for this story were at all surprised by either outcome — all said they expected the vaccines were safe and effective all along. Which has made a number of them wonder whether, in the future, at least, we might find a way to do things differently — without even thinking in terms of trade-offs. Rethinking our approach to vaccine development, they told me, could mean moving faster without moving any more recklessly. A layperson might look at the 2020 timelines and question whether, in the case of an onrushing pandemic, a lengthy Phase III trial — which tests for efficacy — is necessary. But the scientists I spoke to about the way this pandemic may reshape future vaccine development were more focused on how to accelerate or skip Phase I, which tests for safety. More precisely, they thought it would be possible to do all the research, development, preclinical testing, and Phase I trials for new viral pandemics before those new viruses had even emerged — to have those vaccines sitting on the shelf and ready to go when they did. They also thought it was possible to do this for nearly the entire universe of potential future viral pandemics — at least 90 percent of them, one of them told me, and likely more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         *[FT]: Financial Times

As the return mission is happening, the spacecraft minus its cargo of the asteroid sample will proceed to the last part of the mission, heading to a tiny asteroid called 1998KY26. It will arrive in 2031 after a series of Earth flybys. Can Hayabusa 2 really land on this 30-meters wide asteroid? It will be a fascinating challenge. It could also help us work out how to divert asteroid that may be close to crashing into Earth in the future.

Nebraska has tried almost everything over the past two seasons to get the ball in Wan'Dale Robinson's hands as much as possible.
 At times, it almost felt as if the Huskers were forcing the issue in that regard and limiting Robinson's role to a running back carries and bubble screens.
 On Saturday, though, the game plan may have been the best usage yet of the standout sophomore receiver.
 Rather than hand him the ball and hope he can make a play, Nebraska incorporated Robinson into its normal passing game and did so with impressive effectiveness and efficiency.
 Robinson ran routes downfield and torched Purdue's defense on underneath routes all game to the tune of nine catches for 114 yards, both season-highs. Just as notably, he averaged 12.3 yards per reception.
 WIll the Huskers continue to utilize him the same way against a Minnesota defense giving up 240.6 yards per game and conference-worst 8.7 yards per catch?

This artificial model describes for the first time in a biologically realistic way the neuronal processing from seeing an object for object recognition, to action planning and hand muscle control during grasping.

Peterson spoke to reporters during a news conference about a bill he introduced to make an additional 25 million acres available over the next five years for general Conservation Reserve Program signup. Instead of a cap on the program, the bill establishes a minimum requirement of 50 million CRP acres around the nation. The signup cap is currently 27 million acres. When questioned about his potential interest in becoming USDA Ag Secretary, Peterson responded with, “I’m going to back whoever he picks. It’s not my job to pick the next Ag Secretary.” Peterson says he’s been “in the saddle” of public life for more than four decades.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         *[FT]: Financial Times

It only makes sense to follow villains with superheroes, though in Amazon’s “The Boys,” they’re one and the same. An irreverent take on comic book avenger culture, the second season of this excellent, biting series from creator Eric Kripke doubled down on themes of corporate corruption and public gullibility when it returned in September. The crime fighting team of supes known as the Seven are worshiped by America, but in reality they’re a self-centered, vain bunch of Compound V junkies who are being used to sell military contracts, promote political divisions and stoke white supremacy. A vigilante group of misfits are out to destroy them, if only they could stay sober, stop infighting and avoid driving their speed boat into the center of a beached whale (long story). A warped superhero tale made for imperfect times.

Wishing trees, or "dilek ağacı" as they are known in Turkish, can be spotted anywhere in Turkey, with the one outside the House of Virgin Mary in Şirince in western Izmir province one of the most memorable. This tradition comes from the times of pre-Islamic Turkic tribes. As shamans, the people of this era prayed to their Tengri (God) through the temples they built near trees, the source of life. They were known to make wishes to their creator through these trees and with time after Turks accepted Islam, this practice evolved into wishing trees. Nowadays, people mostly write their wishes on paper and hang them on these trees or tie a bandana or piece of fabric on the branches as they make a wish.

K-pop groups were not just about music this year. These groups also caught the attention of the fashion police. One of the most talked-about groups, in terms of style, was BTS. The septet turned heads on and off-screen with casual, retro and fashion show-style outfits. A few members like V and Suga also came in the spotlight for gender-fluid fashion attires. However, BTS was not the only boy group to have challenged fashion stereotypes. TXT fans couldn't stop gushing when Yeonjun stepped out wearing a crop top.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       *[FT]: Financial Times

This, therefore, helped us explain how thousands of LL5 meteorites in our terrestrial collections formed too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              *[FT]: Financial Times

Israel captured the West Bank during the 1967 Middle East war, better known as the Six-Day War. Since then, more than 700,000 Israelis have moved into settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Most of the international community considers Israel&#39;s West Bank settlements illegal according to international law and an obstacle to a two-state solution to the conflict.
