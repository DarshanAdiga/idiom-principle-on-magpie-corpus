CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago Public Schools is expected to announce Wednesday that it will start the school year with all-remote learning in response to coronavirus concerns, according to published reports. The Chicago Sun-Times and Chicago Tribune, citing unnamed sources, said the announcement will be made ahead of a deadline Friday when parents were to decide on whether they wanted to start the year learning from home or a hybrid plan that allows two days of in-person learning. Messages left by The Associated Press with Chicago school officials were not immediately returned. The decision would come as school districts around the country are deciding how to teach children during the pandemic.

Rane Brake Lining Ltd., a leading manufacturer of brake linings, disc pads and clutch facings, reported a net loss of about ₹6.9 crore during the first quarter ended June 2020 due to a truncated period of operations against a net profit of ₹7.3 crore registered during the corresponding year-ago period.
 During the period under review, large portion of the working days were lost owing to the COVID-19-led lockdown. As such, the results for Q1 FY21 are not comparable to the corresponding period of the previous year, it said in a statement.
 “Q1FY21 was not a typical quarter due to COVID-19 related shutdown of operations. The company took several measures to restart production safely and addressed the customer demand. We are experiencing positive momentum in the demand environment. However, we remain cautious on the recovery to pre- COVID-19 levels given the partial lockdown measures continuing in several places. We continue to execute the cost reduction and operational improvement initiatives to reduce the impact of lower volume,” said L. Ganesh, chairman, Rane Group.
 In addition to focus on addressing demand of India original equipment and aftermarket customers, the company is expanding the presence in the International aftermarket. The liquidity position of the company is quite robust and do not foresee any major challenges in the near term, he said.

The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra Looks Like the Massive, Premium Samsung Phone We Wanted All Along


--DocBreak--
But more importantly, when it comes to the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra’s design, it feels like Samsung has truly elevated its build quality and polish to a whole new level. Unlike recent Galaxy Notes, the Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra feature almost perfectly flat screens wrapped with just a hint of a bezel, while tiny elements like an almost invisible earpiece run along the top edge of its display. Around back, Samsung has also switched over to a new matte glass finish that not only feels incredible, it also cuts way down on unsightly fingerprints. And particularly when viewed in Samsung’s signature Mystic Bronze hue, the Note 20 Ultra has the kind of finish that would put a lot of jewellery makers to shame. (If bronze isn’t your style, the Note 20 Ultra will be available in black and white too.)
 Then there’s the Note 20 Ultra’s giant 6.9-inch AMOLED display, which builds off the 120Hz screen offered in the Galaxy S20 Ultra by adding support for variable refresh rates. That means the Note 20 Ultra can adjust dynamically to the kind of content you’re watching. For instance, when viewing a movie, the Note 20 Ultra can lower its refresh rate to better match the frame rate of the video and save on battery life. Then it can automatically bump that refresh rate up to 120Hz while gaming, which is when you might actually need those extra frames.

This is not actor James D'Arcy's first encounter with writing and directing a film. He had that experience a few years ago with an oddball comic short titled "Chicken/Egg," which starred Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, then in his sixth season as Jamie Lannister on "Game of Thrones" (the short is currently available on YouTube). D'Arcy, making his name as a quiet, but dashing screen presence since the late-1990s, had been writing feature scripts for years, and came close to directing one of them, but "Made in Italy" was the first to have all of its pieces fall into place.      And his feature debut behind the camera is a rarity - a sweet and funny and charming and very positive movie that's not filled with cliches. His story teeters close to the edge of a couple of them, but never falls into the abyss.      With a small cast of mostly likable characters, and a scattering of good-for- nothings to make the nice folks look even better, D'Arcy's story introduces Jack (Micheal Richardson), the manager of a London art gallery, and his soon- to-be ex-wife Ruth (Yolanda Kettle) - one of the nasty characters - whose family owns the gallery and is now selling it, leaving Jack out in the cold.      What's a gallery manager who is going through a messy divorce, has no other career skills, has been sad and lost since his mother died in an accident when he was 7, and has no relationship, beyond an estranged one, with his aloof father, to do?      Well, look up dad, take a drive with him to their abandoned old family home in gorgeous Tuscany, sell the place, and have enough money to buy the gallery from his wife's family, of course!      You might wonder if the uncomfortable presence between the father and the son will somehow work out, or if the bitterness emanating from the son's bad marriage will lead to some kind of happiness for him, or if the mission to Italy will result in dreams coming true back home. Those are common and expected story arcs in small, arty films like this.      But "Made in Italy" depends as much on characters and their development as it does in the stories going on around them. It was a spot-on decision to have son Jack and father Robert be played by real-life son and father Micheal Richardson and Liam Neeson. It's not that there's that much of a physical similarity, but it clearly comes across that these two men know and understand each other, and everything clicks when they step into character, even when their roles call for two people who do not know each other very well. That's called good acting.      Their arrival in the little Tuscan village where the house has been empty for 20 years signals that it's time to introduce some comedy - Richardson proves to be adept at pratfalls - and some other characters - it's not long before we meet beautiful restaurant owner Natalia (Valeria Bilello) and business-minded estate agent Kate (Lindsay Duncan), along with a few assorted and rather colorful local characters.      In short order, the plotlines kick in: Do we fix up this dust heap or do we sell it as is? Or do we keep it? Arguments between father and son on those topics ensue. Is Jack getting a little crush on Natalia, even though she has a daughter with her and an ex-husband nearby? Can Robert, once a well-known painter who walked away from it all, ever come back to the limelight?      And then the father-son problems are plopped down in the middle of it all. Did supposedly carefree Robert abandon Jack when his wife died? Will sullen Jack ever figure out a way to get back with his dad? More important, does he even want to?      Amidst regular doses of drama and goofiness, all played out at a slow, smooth pace, with gentle music pushing it along, "Made in Italy" emerges as a story about unhappy people in a beautiful place, and how they're affected by it. There are misunderstandings and there are squabbles, and there's an enjoyable and impossibly happy ending. And even that doesn't feel like a cliche.      "Made in Italy" opens in select theaters and will be available on most VOD and cable platforms on Aug. 7.      Ed Symkus can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.      "Made in Italy"   Written and directed by James D'Arcy   With Liam Neeson, Micheal Richardson, Valeria Bilello, Lindsay Duncan   Rated R

Samsung didn’t stop there, though, because in addition to improving the Note 20 Ultra’s refresh rate, Samsung also lowered the phone’s input latency down to just 9 milliseconds — that’s a big drop compared to the 40ms input latency on the Galaxy Note 10+. Samsung also added the ability to sync your notes in real-time via the Notes app on any of your Samsung devices with the S Pen app for its stylus, as well as record time-synced voice memos, annotate directly onto PDFs, and even straighten out slanted handwritten text. Samsung’s Air Gesture has even gotten an update, with the ability to do things like go back, go home, summon a list of recent apps and more simply by waving the S Pen in the air.
 On the productivity side of things, Samsung has partnered with Microsoft to make the Note 20 Ultra work even better with a Windows PC, so you can mirror your screen, drag and drop files, and access your mobile apps with just a couple taps (no wire necessary). But perhaps the biggest boost to productivity is the ability to connect the Note 20 Ultra to any Mircast-enabled TV and then boot into DeX mode wirelessly, effectively turning the Note 20 into a super portable work machine. And if you’re not feeling productive, starting Sept. 15, you’ll also be able to stream games from Xbox Game Pass Ultimate right onto the Note 20, without ever needing to boot up a console. Samsung has even added support for ultra-wideband tech to Google’s new Nearby Sharing feature, giving you an even faster way of sending files to other nearby Note 20 users. It really feels like for almost any need or situation, the Note 20 Ultra has an answer.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The State Department’s acting inspector general resigned abruptly on Wednesday following the firing of his predecessor in circumstances now being investigated by Congress.Stephen Akard announced his resignation just two days after Democrats issued subpoenas for several of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s top aides to answer questions about the shakeup in the watchdog’s office. The department said Akard would return to the private sector but offered no other reason for his departure."We appreciate his dedication to the department and to our country," the department said in a statement. Akard's deputy, Diana Shaw, will serve as the new acting inspector general once Akard leaves on Friday.Although Akard had not been expected to become the permanent inspector general, his departure underscores the tumult and uncertainty in the office, which has been wracked by Republican charges of leaks and politically biased investigations.Democrats have alleged that Pompeo sought the ouster of Akard's predecessor, Stephen Linick, because Linick was investigating allegations of impropriety by Pompeo.Pompeo has denied the allegations but acknowledged he asked President Donald Trump to fire Linick for poor performance. Akard, who had also served as the director of the Office of Foreign Missions at the State Department, had withdrawn from those investigations.Inspectors general are independent watchdogs empowered by Congress to evaluate the performance of executive branch agencies and investigate allegations of wrongdoing by government officials. President Donald Trump has taken exception to the work of several of the inspectors general and removed them despite congressional objections.On Monday, House Democrats subpoenaed four senior Pompeo aides for interviews, saying the Trump administration was stonewalling their investigation into Linick's firing in May. Akard was not among those subpoenaed.Linick had appeared before investigators in June and said top department officials tried to bully him and dissuade his office from conducting a review of a multibillion dollar arms sale to Saudi Arabia before he was fired. He also said his office was looking into allegations that Pompeo and his wife may have misused government staff to run personal errands and several other matters.The top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, said the investigation will not end and he expressed concern about Akard’s departure.“I do not believe he was the right choice to lead the office, but I am concerned that his sudden resignation leaves another opportunity for the Trump administration to try to weaken oversight and accountability,” Menendez said. “The ongoing bicameral investigation into the abrupt and unexplained dismissal of IG Linick will continue full speed ahead.”The subpoenas for closed-door depositions are for Undersecretary of State for Management Brian Bulatao, acting State Department legal adviser Marik String, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs Michael Miller and senior adviser Toni A. Porter.The department flatly rejected the Democrats' allegations as "egregiously inaccurate" but did not say whether the officials would comply with the subpoenas. Pompeo has rejected allegations that Linick was fired for investigating alleged impropriety and Pompeo has denied he was aware of any such probe into his or his wife's matters. He has said Linick was removed for not doing his job.Linick, who had been inspector general since 2013, said he was in a “state of shock” when he was fired. He told congressional investigators that he had opened a review of last year’s $8 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia at the request of lawmakers who claimed Pompeo had inappropriately circumvented Congress to approve the deal. He said Bulatao and String then tried to stop him.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

When Hingham High athletic director Jim Quatromoni received Sarah Dacey's application, he did a double take.
 Dacey, who applied and was recently named the new head coach of the Hingham girls soccer team, brings with her a wealth of collegiate coaching experience along with a storied playing career that featured three national championships at the University of North Carolina and a professional career.
 "It definitely required a thorough second read to make sure I was seeing what I thought I was seeing," said Quatromoni. "After our conversation with her, I realized we potentially had a good fit here."
 Dacey, who spent the last four seasons as the head coach at Barry University in Miami compiling a 45-15-1 record, was looking to return closer to home with her 2-year-old daughter, Sadie, and wife, Mary-Frances Monroe. Dacey was a standout at Framingham High.
 "It was really important for us to raise (Sadie) close to our family," said Dacey. "When I found out about Hingham of course I was super excited because I know what a great town Hingham is. I know what a great soccer program soccer they have. For me, I was ready to shift gears a little bit, change my career trajectory."
 Dacey takes over for Ryan Puntiri, who was let go due to accusations of verbal bullying during his time as coach of the Harborwomen. Puntiri won three state championships during his 13 years in Hingham.
 Most recently, Dacey was the head coach at Division 2 Barry University in Miami and also has previous coaching experience at the Division 1 (Boston College, University of Albany, Providence, Tennessee) and Division 3 (Babson) level. While at Barry, she was named the Sunshine State Conference's Coach of the Year twice. She also served as the head coach at Babson from 2005-2010. During nine seasons as a collegiate head coach, her teams have finished above .500 every season.
 "First and foremost I want the girls to know that I'm going to care about them as people and I'm going to try to get to know them as people and know their families and what they're all about," said Dacey. "Coaching is about motivating and influencing, hopefully in a positive way, so that's my style."
 Dacey's first coaching job out of college was as an assistant on Allison Foley's staff at Boston College. She's also has ties to former United States Women's National Team coach Jill Ellis.
 With her connections across the country in the collegiate game, she'll be able to guide Hingham's bevy of talented players through the recruiting process.
 "For those that aspire to play in college, I know what college coaches are looking for, whether it comes to talent, body language, all those kinds of things," said Dacey. "They know that I've been through everything that they're going through. I played in high school, I went on to play in college. I went on to play professionally. I have a lot of great people that I've met that have influenced my career and me as a person. You take all those bits and pieces along the way when you're a coach."
 She doesn't plan to just help the most talented players, she hopes to build a program where everyone feels valued.
 "She's just as excited helping a kid that maybe couldn't crack the rotation to develop skills enough to be able to just simply crack the rotation even if they never get college (offers)," said Quatromoni. "She wants to coach a program."
 "I want every player on the team to feel like they're important in some way," said Dacey.
 Following an unconventional hiring process, Dacey is preparing for an uncertain season. With the interview process being handled over Zoom, Dacey will now hope to get to know some of her players before the season begins, whatever that season may look like. Dacey said she was having a Zoom call with her new captains on Tuesday.
 "It's very uncertain times," said Dacey. "Things are ever-changing. I think what I've learned during this time is we're not in control so you've just got to roll with it and I think that's hopefully a lesson that we can teach these kids that you do just have to roll with it sometimes. You're not always going to like what hand we're dealt but we've just got to make the best of it. That's the attitude I'm going with it.
 "Whether it's October, whether we can only train or we have to go in the spring, it is what it is. The safety of our community is the most important thing and of these kids."
 Quatromoni has plenty of confidence in his newest coach.
 "I have no doubt that without any direction I could plop her into the middle of a season and she'd figure it out," said Quatromoni.
 Dacey's wife, Monroe, will also bring a wealth of high-level coaching experience as she plans to be around the program. Monroe played professionally for over a decade and played for the United States Women's National Team. She also has collegiate head-coaching experience at the University of Albany and the University of Miami. Monroe was recently appointed as the commissioner of the Development Player League, a high level soccer league that includes South Shore Select, a local club based out of Hingham.
 "(Hingham is)a big soccer and lacrosse town, I know that," said Dacey, who also played lacrosse at UNC. "They care about their high school athletics. It's a big supportive community so those things were a real draw to me just to be a part of a community that is supportive and has a lot of tradition.
 "As a strong female, hopefully I can be a great role model to these girls and help them have a great experience."
