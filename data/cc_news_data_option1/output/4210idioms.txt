In a significant move that comes amid a Sino-India border row, India on Monday announced Australia's participation in the upcoming Malabar exercise along with the US and Japan, effectively making it the first military-level engagement between the four member nations grouping -- the Quad.
 The invitation by India to the Australian Navy for the exercise next month came two weeks after the foreign ministers of the Quad held extensive talks in Tokyo with a focus on enhancing their cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, a region that has been witnessing increasing Chinese military assertiveness.
 "As India seeks to increase cooperation with other countries in the maritime security domain and in the light of increased defence cooperation with Australia, Malabar 2020 will see the participation of the Australian Navy," the defence ministry said in a statement.
 It also said the participants of the exercise collectively support free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific, remarks which reflecteda subtle change in India's approach towards the drill as well as larger messaging. The exercise is expected to be held in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.
 "The participants of Exercise Malabar 2020 are engaging to enhance safety and security in the maritime domain. They collectively support free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific and remain committed to a rules based international order," the ministry said.
 For the last few years, Australia has been showing keen interest in participating in the exercise and India's decision to heed to Australia's request to be part of the mega naval drill comes in the midst of growing strain in ties with China over the border row in eastern Ladakh.
 The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific region in the wake of China's increasing military muscle flexing has become a major talking point among leading global powers.
 The US has been favouring making Quad a security architecture to check China's growing assertiveness.
 In her reaction, Australian Defence Minister Linda Reynolds CSC termed the participation of her country in the exercise a "milestone opportunity" and said it will showcase the "deep trust" between four major Indo-Pacific democracies and their shared will to work together on common security interests.
 "High-end military exercises like Malabar are key to enhancing Australia's maritime capabilities, building interoperability with our close partners, and demonstrating our collective resolve to support an open and prosperous Indo- Pacific," Reynolds said.
 Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said the announcement was another important step in Australia's deepening relationship with India.
 "It will bolster the ability of India, Australia, Japan and the United States to work together to uphold peace and stability across our region," she said.
 The Malabar exercise started in 1992 as a bilateral drill between the Indian Navy and the US Navy in the Indian Ocean. Japan became a permanent member of the exercise in 2015. This annual exercise was conducted off the coast of Guam in the Philippine Sea in 2018 and off the coast of Japan in 2019.
 "This year, the exercise has been planned on a non-contact - at sea' format," the defence ministry said, adding that the exercise will strengthen the coordination between the Navies of the participating countries. Defence and security ties between India and Australia have been on an upswing in the last few years.
 In June, India and Australia elevated their ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership and signed a landmark deal for reciprocal access to military bases for logistics support during an online summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison. India has already inked mutual logistics support deal with the other two Quad members. The Mutual Logistics Support Agreement (MLSA) allows militaries of the two countries to use each other''s bases for repair and replenishment of supplies besides facilitating scaling up of overall defence cooperation.
 Last month, the navies of India and Australian carried out a two-day mega exercise in the Indian Ocean region that featured a range of complex naval manoeuvres, anti-aircraft drills and helicopter operations.

Incontro in video conferenza, oggi alle 18, di Greta Thunberg e altre giovani attiviste per il clima, Adélaïde Charlier (Belgio), Luisa Neubauer (Germania) e Laura Vallaro e Martina Comparelli per l'Italia, con il premier Giuseppe Conte e il ministro dell'Ambiente Sergio Costa per lanciare il messaggio che "è il momento di iniziare a trattare l'emergenza climatica come una crisi". Lo rende noto il movimento Fridays For Future (Fff) Italia ricordando che "le giovani attiviste hanno inviato a tutti i leader dell'Ue e del mondo una lettera aperta (https://climateemergencyeu.org/) che è stata già firmata da quasi 130.000 persone".      Nel ricordare che "l'Italia ha un ruolo cruciale da svolgere a livello Ue e internazionale nell'azione per il clima in quanto terza economia dell'Ue, ospite del G20 del prossimo anno e co-organizzatrice del vertice sul clima Cop26", il movimento Fff spiega che "le ragazze chiederanno al primo ministro Conte di affrontare l'emergenza climatica e passare all'azione seguendo le richieste della lettera. Queste includono lo stop a tutti gli investimenti e i sussidi ai combustibili fossili, l'uscita dal fossile, rendere l'ecocidio un crimine internazionale, e l'istituzione di budget annuali di carbonio vincolanti basati sui migliori dati scientifici disponibili".      Da quando è stata pubblicata la lettera aperta, "i leader europei hanno continuato a mettere la testa sotto la sabbia riguardo la crisi climatica, prendendo poche o nessuna decisione concreta, nonostante diversi incontri con le attiviste - spiega la nota - Come primo passo, tutti i leader dell'Ue dovrebbero garantire da adesso che le nuove politiche climatiche dell'Ue siano in linea con l'obiettivo dell'Accordo di Parigi di limitare il riscaldamento globale a 1,5 gradi centigradi, senza utilizzare scappatoie o contabilità creativa".

For both countries, there is no reason to overreact to these projections on per capita GDP for a number of reasons. First, using GDP as an indication of achievement has been criticised by economists for long. The very method of calculating GDP is flawed and it fails to show the real health of the economy. To avoid repetition, I am not discussing those here. But readers may refer to my earlier pieces on this topic ("Our incomprehensible obsession with GDP", May 19, 2019 and "Bangladesh's GDP growth number does not hold water", August 17, 2020). Second, comparing nominal GDP of one country with another is not correct. One dollar does not have the same value across countries. For example, one dollar in Bangladesh will not buy the same amount of goods and services in another country. The cost of living varies from country to country. That is why GDP based on purchasing power parity (PPP) is used while making GDP comparisons among countries, instead of nominal GDP. Hence in terms of PPP based GDP India is still ahead of Bangladesh. India's GDP at PPP is USD 6,284 and Bangladesh's USD 5,139.

Under his 'Experience' section, Braun is listed as a Senior Programmer for Bethesda in Maryland, where he "rewrote animation system for Starfield from scratch."
 If you're a little tired of looking at the same animations in Bethesda games in general, from the likes of Skyrim, Fallout 4, and Fallout 76, then this is certainly welcome news. You might recall how, in September, Bethesda's Todd Howard revealed that the studio was "overhauling" its game engine for both Starfield and The Elder Scrolls 6. Combining a new animation system with a new game engine certainly sounds promising for Bethesda's space-faring RPG.
 That news, which was the first announcement of sorts that Bethesda had made about Starfield since it was first revealed, broke alongside Microsoft's purchase of Bethesda. It's been over a month now since Microsoft purchased Zenimax Media Inc., Bethesda's parent company, bringing in studios like Arkane, Tanga Gameworks, and others under its wing.
 We still know relatively little about Starfield, though. Aside from it being an RPG set in space and being Bethesda's first original IP in over two decades, we know next to nothing about the RPG so far.

Priced at the rough equivalent of $295 in Taiwan, the 6.5-inch handset comes with a reasonably stylish design, although a slightly too prominent notch and a pretty massive chin (by late 2020 standards, at least) strongly contribute to an overall mediocre artistic impression. Probably the worst thing about HTC's latest attempt at a mobile industry comeback is the sub-par 1600 x 720 pixel resolution of the aforementioned 6.5-inch display, closely followed by the phone's excessive 203-gram weight and 9mm profile.
   
 On the bright side, the main reason why this thing is so chunky is that it packs a hefty 5,000mAh battery. Combined with a frugal screen and an octa-core Snapdragon 720G processor, that juicer should be able to keep the lights on for a couple of days of work on a single charge while supporting decent 15W speeds.
   
 Another good thing about the HTC Desire 20+ is that it retains the good old fashioned headphone jack, while the 48 + 5 + 2 + 5MP quad rear-facing camera system doesn't look half bad on paper either. Of course, we'd have to take it for a spin out in the real world to see what it can actually do, which is unlikely to ever happen.
   
 But perhaps the more important question is whether or not any of you would be interested in picking up this device at around $300 with Android 10 pre- installed, as well as 6 gigs of memory and 128 gigs of internal storage space in tow. How about it, guys and gals? Do you think HTC stands a chance of ever returning into the Western spotlight with these types of mid-range efforts?

Although the HTC Desire 20+ is certainly not as disappointing as the Wildfire E2, everything from that unnecessarily convoluted name to its generic appearance and middle-of-the-road spec sheet seems explicitly designed to be instantly forgotten.

 For all but the wealthiest Americans, this recession is far from over. If we as a country prioritize evidence-based virus safety measures, we won't just wear a mask and practice social distancing. We'll pass a robust relief package that helps those who need it most, so we can weather the storm and end the recession for all of us.

The virus-ravaged airline industry reached a milestone Sunday, carrying more than 1 million passengers for the first time in seven months.
 U.S. airport security checkpoints processed 1,031,505 people, or 39.6% of the equivalent day in 2019, according to a tally by the Transportation Security Administration.
 Several of the busiest days since mid-March have occurred in the past two weeks and passenger loads have been gradually increasing, but that provides scant relief for an industry still reeling from the coronavirus pandemic. If Sunday's level were maintained for an entire year, it would roughly roll the industry back to levels last seen 36 years ago, according to the trade group for large carriers, Airlines for America.
 The steep drop in fliers has prompted billions of dollars of losses and tens of thousands of job cuts or voluntary furloughs as impacts reverberate across the aviation industry. A federal aid package that had covered the costs of airline payrolls and forbid job cuts expired on Oct. 1 and attempts to extend it have faltered in partisan gridlock.
 U.S. airlines rose, with a Standard & Poor's index of major carriers advancing 1.8% at 9:59 a.m. in New York. United Airlines Holdings Inc. led the gains, climbing 3.5% to $35.35. United and Delta Air Lines Inc. said last week that they expect a long, slow recovery until there's a vaccine.

The last known chief of the militant Basque separatist group ETA has had the first of two back-to-back trials on terrorism charges postponed.
 Josu Urrutikoetxea deems the charges “absurd” because of his role in ending a conflict that claimed hundreds of lives in Spain over half a century.
 He led ETA during one of its bloodiest periods, when its victims included children killed while they slept after a bombing at a Zaragoza police compound in 1987.
 He was set to face justice in Paris this week, following two sentences for a total of 15 years in prison for his alleged role in attack plots in the 2000s and 2010s respectively that he appealed when he was arrested.
 But the judge on the earlier case postponed the trial to February 22 and 23 next year because some of the key defence witnesses could not make it to Monday’s hearing due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 In a rare interview after 17 years on the run, Urrutikoetxea offered an apology, advised other separatist movements against resorting to violence, and painted himself as a changed man.
 ETA’s violence caused around 850 deaths and thousands of injuries, and hijacked the Basque and Spanish political debate for decades.
 Those who lost loved ones say that just because Urrutikoetxea oversaw ETA’s end in 2018, that does not erase his past.
 Now 69, diminished by a battle with cancer and facing the prospect of life behind bars, the man widely known by his police alias Josu Ternera says he is sorry for “irreparable damage” caused by ETA violence as it sought to build an independent state straddling the Pyrenees mountain range between Spain and France.
 Asked if he would apologise to ETA victims’ families, he told The Associated Press: “Of course, (I offer) apologies for something that we can’t repair.”
 But he insisted the Basque independence movement suffered, too, from violence rooted in the Spanish dictatorship under Franco that ended more than four decades ago.
 “The Basque country was entering into a black hole” of cultural repression, he said, “and we had to do the maximum to pull it out”.
 Some of ETA’s victims said they want more than apologies from Urrutikoetxea; they want him to face justice.
 “I don’t seek revenge against Josu Ternera,” said Lucia Ruiz, who was 10 years old when she was injured in the 1987 blast targeting military police barracks in Zaragoza where she lived. “But this gentleman tried to kill me and I want for him to pay a price for it.”
 Since his arrest last year, Urrutikoetxea has campaigned to shed the terrorist label and rebrand himself as a repentant, aging peacemaker.
 He won conditional release in July pending trial, after lawyers argued poor health made him vulnerable to contracting coronavirus.
 He is now staying with a friend in Paris, where he is trying to get a college diploma and is allowed out a few hours a day with an electronic bracelet.
 In a petition published Saturday, more than 250 intellectuals from multiple countries called for France and Spain to end Urrutikoetxea’s prosecution, arguing that putting him on trial “is implicitly criminalising all negotiators and calling into question all current and future peace processes in the world”.
 Those calls are rejected by most of Spain’s political mainstream.
 Ruiz and Spanish authorities believe that Urrutikoetxea, as ETA’s leader, either approved or knew about the car that, loaded with dynamite, exploded under her window at the Zaragoza Civil Guard headquarters where she lived with her father, mother and sister.
 Three ETA assailants were tried and imprisoned for carrying out the attack, which killed 11 people, including six minors.
 “He now presents himself as the country’s saviour,” Ms Ruiz said. “But this gentleman is a murderer, with murder written in capital letters.”
 Urrutikoetxea denies any role, saying, “They want me to answer for something I had nothing to do with.”
 He led ETA in the late 1980s, was arrested in 1989 and spent the next 11 years behind bars in France and Spain.
 As ETA’s violent methods lost sway, Urrutikoetxea served as a legislator in the Basque regional parliament and a negotiator in talks with Spanish envoys to try to end the group’s activities.
 ETA gave up its arms in 2017, and Urrutikoetxea read the statement announcing ETA’s final dismantling in an audio recording released on May 3 2018.
 Indicted for his alleged role in the Zaragoza attack while he was on a parliamentary visit to Switzerland in 2002, he was Spain’s most-wanted fugitive until his arrest outside a hospital in the French Alps in May 2019.

The PS5 cooling fan will get online optimization updates that will adjust the fan's speed based on the game you're playing.
 The news, which comes from _Eurogamer_ by way of Japanese gaming site _4Gamer.net_, is based on an interview with Yasuhiro Ootori, the vice president of mechanical design at Sony. "Various games will be released in the future, and data on the APU's behavior in each game will be collected. We have a plan to optimize fan control based on this date," Ootori tells 4Gamer. In layman's terms, this means data on the games that cause heavy loads on _PS5_ will be sent to Sony, and the internal fan can be adjusted accordingly - even if that means your living room is going to sound like the runways at JFK Airport.
 The PS5 has a double-sided air intake fan and internal sensor temperatures inside the APU and the main board that control the fan speed. Now we know that speed will also be adjusted with online updates based on game data collected by Sony.
 In order to test the PS5's fan capabilities, Sony made a completely transparent model of the PS5 chassis and observed dry ice flowing through it. The team took temperature readings in each area of the system and the engineers adjusted the fan accordingly. I'd like to formally request a transparent PS5 so I can relive my clear blue Nintendo Gameboy days, please.
 As _we previously reported_, we got an incredibly close look at the PS5 and its design two weeks ago, when Ootori himself disassembled the entire console down to its circuit boards. If that wasn't mind-blowing enough, news that the console will regularly get cooling fan adjustments based on data Sony is collecting is taking it even further. Welcome to the future of gaming, eh?

But Kris Steele, executive director of Oklahomans for Criminal Justice Reform, said the reality is Oklahoma’s prisons are overcrowded and have been for some time. The state has one of the highest incarceration rates per capita, spends more than $500 million a year to incarcerate people and there’s no evidence that administering excessive sentences drives down crime or enhances public safety.
 SQ 805 takes a step forward to bring some standard or sense to the state’s sentencing guidelines for nonviolent offenders, Steele said recently during a presentation to Enid Rotary Club.
 “At the end of the day, I just want to emphasize that it’s not a free pass,” he said. “This just gives us a chance to bring our sentencing guidelines in line with the national average.”
 Steele said a person convicted of a nonviolent drug crime spends about 80% longer in Oklahoma prisons than they would anywhere else in the nation.
 He said the state question seeks to limit the practice of adding additional years to someone’s prison sentence simply because they have a previous nonviolent conviction in their past.
 Offenders still face the maximum range of punishments set by the Legislature, but they won’t get any additional time because of their past, Steele said. And even if the current offense is nonviolent, SQ 805 won’t apply to someone with a previous violent conviction.
 He said SQ 805 will save nearly $200 million, but it will take taxpayers six to eight years to see the full economic benefit.
 The measure gives Oklahomans a second chance, Steele said.
 But Mackenzie Masilon, public policy and communications coordinator for Oklahoma Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, said SQ 805 is going to significantly reduce options for survivors seeking resolution through the criminal justice system.
 Most domestic violence and sexual assault organizations are members of the umbrella group, which provides training for advocates, mental health professionals and law enforcement who deal with victims of domestic abuse, sexual assault and stalking.
 “Our biggest concern when you’re removing the ability for sentence enhancements to be used, you’re saying no matter how many times an offender has committed the crime, they’re going to be treated like it’s the first time,” Masilon said. “There has to be accountability somewhere for victims who seek justice through the criminal justice system.”
 Prosecutors rely on enhanced sentences to ensure victims are safe and offenders are behind bars, Masilon said.
 She said advocates question why domestic abuse is considered a nonviolent crime to begin with, and perhaps lawmakers need to go back and take a closer look at that next year.
 “I don’t think it’s fair to say that SQ 805 is the only thing that needs improved upon as far as policy is concerned, but it’s certainly not going to help anything,” Masilon said.

Here are the basics of the 2020 referendum:      A no vote would preserve the city's current commission form of government, which the National League of Cities says is the rarest, but oldest form with less than 1 percent of American cities run this way. (Nearby Mechanicville is one of them.) In this structure, mayor and four commissioners are elected to head departments. Each is considered part-time. The mayor currently handles appointments to land-use boards, the city's recreation and planning departments (among other things) while the four commissioners are elected to oversee accounts, finance, public works and public safety. Thus an elected official's function is both legislative and executive. They are aided in the running of their departments by politically appointed full-time deputies.

One of two trials for Josu Ternera, the former leader of Basque separatist group ETA, was postponed in Paris on Monday to next year after witnesses did not show up in court.
 The first of two retrials for Ternera, arrested in France last year after years on the run, was to have been held on Monday and Tuesday before the Paris appeals court.
 Ternera, whose real name is Jose Antonio Urrutikoetxea Bengoetxea, headed the ETA from 1977 to 1992 and is thought to have been behind a strategy of combining car bomb and shooting attacks in Spain in the 1980s.
 In hiding since 2002, Ternera was convicted in absentia in 2010 on charges of associating with terrorists after his fingerprints were found in an apartment known to be used by ETA operatives in Lourdes, southern France.
 He was sentenced to seven years in prison, and given a new eight-year term in 2017 after again being convicted in absentia of participating in a terrorist organisation.
 After eluding police for years, he was arrested in May 2019 at a hospital in the French Alps where he was to undergo an operation.
 As both prison sentences were handed down in his absence, he was able to request a retrial for both.
 The first, now moved to February 22 and 23 next year, is on charges of having participated in the ETA between 2002 and 2005.
 In the second matter, Ternera is scheduled to appear on Wednesday and Thursday before another Paris court over his alleged role in ETA's political apparatus between 2010 and 2013.
 Ternera, who is 69 and has health problems, has been under house arrest in Paris with an electronic bracelet since July.
 His extradition to Spain was approved in September 2019 to stand trial over a 1987 attack on a police barracks in the northern Spanish city of Zaragoza that killed 11 people, but an appeal is pending.
 Another decision is due on November 18 on a second extradition request, concerning suspicion of Ternera's involvement in the 1980 murder of a director of French tyre company Michelin in Spain.

In a significant move that comes amid a Sino-India border row, India on Monday announced Australia's participation in the upcoming Malabar exercise along with the US and Japan, effectively making it the first military-level engagement between the four member nations grouping -- the Quad.The invitation by India to the Australian Navy for the exercise next month came two weeks after the foreign ministers of the Quad held extensive talks in Tokyo with a focus on enhancing their cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, a region that has been witnessing increasing Chinese military assertiveness.&quot;As India seeks to increase cooperation with other countries in the maritime security domain and in the light of increased defence cooperation with Australia, Malabar 2020 will see the participation of the Australian Navy,&quot; the defence ministry said in a statement.It also said the participants of the exercise collectively support free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific, remarks which reflecteda subtle change in India's approach towards the drill as well as larger messaging. The exercise is expected to be held in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.&quot;The participants of Exercise Malabar 2020 are engaging to enhance safety and security in the maritime domain. They collectively support free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific and remain committed to a rules based international order,&quot; the ministry said.For the last few years, Australia has been showing keen interest in participating in the exercise and India's decision to heed to Australia's request to be part of the mega naval drill comes in the midst of growing strain in ties with China over the border row in eastern Ladakh.The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific region in the wake of China's increasing military muscle flexing has become a major talking point among leading global powers.The US has been favouring making Quad a security architecture to check China's growing assertiveness.In her reaction, Australian Defence Minister Linda Reynolds CSC termed the participation of her country in the exercise a &quot;milestone opportunity&quot; and said it will showcase the &quot;deep trust&quot; between four major Indo-Pacific democracies and their shared will to work together on common security interests.&quot;High-end military exercises like Malabar are key to enhancing Australia's maritime capabilities, building interoperability with our close partners, and demonstrating our collective resolve to support an open and prosperous Indo-Pacific,&quot; Reynolds said.Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said the announcement was another important step in Australia's deepening relationship with India.&quot;It will bolster the ability of India, Australia, Japan and the United States to work together to uphold peace and stability across our region,&quot; she said.The Malabar exercise started in 1992 as a bilateral drill between the Indian Navy and the US Navy in the Indian Ocean. Japan became a permanent member of the exercise in 2015. This annual exercise was conducted off the coast of Guam in the Philippine Sea in 2018 and off the coast of Japan in 2019.&quot;This year, the exercise has been planned on a non-contact - at sea' format,&quot; the defence ministry said, adding that the exercise will strengthen the coordination between the Navies of the participating countries. Defence and security ties between India and Australia have been on an upswing in the last few years.In June, India and Australia elevated their ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership and signed a landmark deal for reciprocal access to military bases for logistics support during an online summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison. India has already inked mutual logistics support deal with the other two Quad members. The Mutual Logistics Support Agreement (MLSA) allows militaries of the two countries to use each other''s bases for repair and replenishment of supplies besides facilitating scaling up of overall defence cooperation.Last month, the navies of India and Australian carried out a two-day mega exercise in the Indian Ocean region that featured a range of complex naval manoeuvres, anti-aircraft drills and helicopter operations.
