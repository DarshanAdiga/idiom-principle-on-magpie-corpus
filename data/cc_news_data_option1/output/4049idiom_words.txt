Roadworks of some form are encountered by many road-users daily. Despite being a cause of frustration and disruption to transport networks, they are an absolute necessity to maintaining the health of highways, streets, underground infrastructure, and roadside assets. Roadside assets include many of the ubiquitous features of roads we take for granted, including streetlights, signage, bollards, and curbs. They are vital to safe and operational transport networks and yet, until now, technology to effectively monitor the ‘health’ of roadside infrastructure has not been available to the organisations responsible for maintaining it.
